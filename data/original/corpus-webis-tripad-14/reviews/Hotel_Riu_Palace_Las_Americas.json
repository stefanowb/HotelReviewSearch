We had a jr. oceanview suite with a beautiful view. We were on the 6th floor. The room was spotless as was the entire hotel. Food delicious,drinks came nonstop. Bartenders were great! Bed comfortable,room service prompt& friendly. Entire staff seemed honestly happy to serve you & we never passed a staffmember who did not greet us! The pool bar is fun as well as the swimup bar. The sister property, Riu Cancun, is also nice.You are able to use their hotel bar &resturant which is nice as the Palace facilities close earlier& this hotel is right next door. I had read some reviews saying beds were hard, no water pressure,etc. Not true!!! This is really a Palace!! Cannot wait to return.

Eric was great he canceled the other Riu reservation switched it over the right Riu and then did the same for my nephew.

This was my second and last time staying at a RIU resort, (Cabo and Cuncun). This review is about the one in Cancun. Our stay was 7 nights. The beds are terrible, like laying on a rock, and the food was okay. The pool bar was fantastic and the entertainment staff was great at the pool bar. The way they do the sit down dinner reservations is awful. They only give times for 2 seating's a night and limit the amount of people. We only got a chance to eat at the steak house because of this but was told by others in our group the food was okay at the other places. Plus guys have to wear long pants to all sit down dinners, which is insane in Mexico in June. That has to be the dumbest rule ever. Guys weren't allowed to wear dress shorts but we saw one guy wear jogging pants and they let him in. Women could wear what ever they wanted. The steak house was extremely hot and we couldn't enjoy the food, although was pretty tasty but some of us got sick after. The beach was very nice, small, but no beach umbrella's at all. There were umbrella's at the pool but not on the beach which we thought was very strange considering the other RIU next door which is a step below this one had umbrella's. The breakfast and lunch buffet were above average. The Dinner buffet was just average. They didn't mix up the type of food that was served like they did in Cabo. Cabo's dinner buffet was awesome. You want good Mexican food go across the street from the resort to the Sea Horse. The late night pizza place took forever, pizza was okay but the service was terrible. I had to complain several times before we got our food. The drinks at the bar's were very good and strong. We spent most of our day at the pool bar and the entertainment staff did a great job. There was volleyball, basketball, Olympic games, aerobics and much more activity in the pool than I expected. The water balloon fight was awesome.

From the moment we arrived it was first class all the way. The drinks were amazing and free flowing. The beach was amazing. Big rocks to snorkel around and don't have to worry about any small ones. I would suggest to bring your own snorkeling gear as they charge a federally 2.00 fee and didn't look to sanitary. Food was spectacular bravo to the chef cooking omelets yummy!!!!!! Be sure to bring \"long pants\" or you cant eat at some of the restaurants. I recommend making dinner reservations early for all week. Eat at the hotel it's better free and just easier when your in a group. THE STAFF IS SPECTACULAR! I have never in my life been treated so well they went above and beyond their call of duty to make sure we were taken care of. The only complaint I would have is they are semi handicap friendly only 3 rooms in the whole hotel on ground floor. And ramps are way out of they way. There are no ramps into or around any pools or hot tubs, and only 1 handicapped bathroom by the pool that everyone seems to disregard the \"handicapped\" sigh attached out on the door so there was a 5 minute wait every time we had to get to the bathroom, and the spa was extremely overpriced.

You know by now from other reviewers, that you must make your specialty restauant reservations between 5:00PM and 6:00PM the day before in order to get in. So, on your first night you are eating at the buffet, like it or not. However, actually getting there at 5:00PM is too late. People start lining up at 4:15PM, for example, for the Japanese sushi restuarant. Waiting in line every day is not my idea of fun. It's actually quite a ridiculous requirement. You wind up rushing back to the hotel to be on line \"in time\" every day if you happen to be away from the hotel for a tour or something. I did hear the Portugese restaurant in the lobby was very good, by the way, and the steak house on the outside patio of the buffet area was also very good. The best bartender is outside the Japanese restaurant (Rudolfo). Not only does he make good umbrella drinks, but he's funny too!If champagne is your drink of choice, like mine, the champagne flows day and night here. The large lounge and adjoining bar are beautiful. The lobby bar is stunning and fun, though seems to attract a lot of smokers for some reason. The resort quiets down early. No noisy revelers here. This is an adult resort. People get dressed for dinner and everyone acts maturely. There are some singles here, but mostly in their 30's and 40's from what we saw. The entertainment is interesting. The Michael Jackson impersonator was incredible. He could easily work in Vegas if he wanted. My husband raved for two days about the cuban dancers (I'm sure the scantily clad beautiful women couldn't be what he was actually raving about, could it?) I forgot to mention, we waited several hours to get a room, but it was worth it. They upgraded us to a room with a huge balcony - what a view. When they say check-in is at 3:00PM they mean it! All in all, we had a nice time except for the above mentioned complaints. If being at the pool is not important to you, you will enjoy the beach and my swim-up bar complaint won't make a difference to you. If you order room service every morning like we did in order to get our first cup of coffee and tea (there are no coffee makers in the room) check off the box that indicates a time at least a 1/2 hour earlier than you would normally want it. You could even have breakfast delivered if you write what you want in the box on the same order form. Not many people realize it, but above and below the outside patio buffet are jacuzzi's. Just walk up the stairs near the towel hut for the outside jacuzzi and down the steps for the bathrooms, spa and two underground jacuzzis. That's it for now, take your camera and enjoy.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "aggie12", "date": "March 22, 2006", "id": 4725116}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "Hotel was first class all the way.

I booked a Jr. Suite and it was on the 3rd floor overlooking the ocean. The room was very clean and was fairly big with a sitting area, king size bed and balcony. I asked for a mattress pad as another reviewer suggested and it made quite a difference. The lobby area and lobby bar are very nice, service is great and the people working at the hotel are so nice to you, polite, always smiling, etc. Yes, there are those folks that think nothing is good enough for them and write reviews as if they thought they were royalty and although this is not a 5 star hotel in it's own right, I would say it is pretty close and I'd give it 5 stars! First off, the price for this trip was a total bargain (I paid twice as much to go to Jamaica and it was a complete waste of money); although the hurricane left its mark in Canc\u00fan they are recovering quickly. There was absolutely no damage to Riu Palace other than the palm trees which took a beating. I did not try the restaurants requiring reservations, but heard they were pretty good. The thing is, you have to make reservations at a certain hour of the day (I believe between 5PM and 6PM) for the following night. Personally, I was not about to worry about making the reservations on time, so I just didn't even try. The food at the main restaurant (Don Roberto's I believe) was decent but this is where I give it only 4 stars (then again I struggle because the price of the trip was so low, I could not expect top of the line items). As far as the mildew or mold another reviewer reported, I did not see any indication of mold in my room and I did check. The place is extremely humid and yes ocean mist will come into your room, but for God sakes, you are staying by the OCEAN!! This cannot be helped and you will have the same experience around the world when you stay by the water, unless the hotel is hermetically sealed and you are not allowed to open windows. I opened the window one morning then turned around and the floor in my room was completely soaked! It's just the way it is when you are right next to the ocean... So expect it! Lastly, the salty water will certainly make your clothes and room smell due to the fact your clothes stay pretty damp the whole time. My clothes and suitcase did smell also and I brought it back with me... but I left the suitcase out in the sun for a day and the smell is gone!!

Obviously, if I had wanted to stay at the Riu Palace Las Americas, I would have booked my vacation there originally.", "title": "Despite everything, we had a great time . . .", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "JezebelBulldog", "date": "December 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4160265}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "Now . . . on to the Riu Palace Las Americas:", "title": "Great Place visited 11-24 thru 12/01", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "witch1", "date": "December 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4160050}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "The resort itself is beautiful, well-maintained, and very clean.
