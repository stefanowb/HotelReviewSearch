The front desk was helpful, and had us booked in a jiff. I mentioned that I would love an early check in, and he suggested that I try calling around 1pm on day of check in, and they may have something available. I did just that. I called at 1pm when we made it to town, and they had our room ready. Check in was fast, and easy. We hadn't even made it all the way in our room before we heard the room's phone ring, and my hubby ran to pick it up. It was the front desk, and they said they had noticed us walking in with an infant, and asked if we were in need of a crib! WHAT?! We have stayed in hotels/motels all over the US, and have always had to plead for our crib to be delivered before bed time, so we were shocked that before we even had time to kick off our shoes, we already had our youngest's bed delivered, and ready for her. After that we suited up, and headed to the \"heated pool\". Well the pool isn't very warm at all. We lasted in the frigid water all of 30 minutes, before we called it quits due to blue lips, and goose pimples. I do suggest maybe a warning as to the pools temp, or something of that nature. We got the kids all excited to go swimming, and it was a bit of a bust. The room was clean, and it came with a DVD player (that is pretty rare). Your morning shower is sure to wake you up with it's fire hose like pressure (the hubby loved it). The breakfast was great\u2026kiddos love picking out all the different things they want to eat. Check out was quick, and painless. All in all, a great, quick stay!
