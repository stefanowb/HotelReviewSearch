There was a card wishing me a happy birthday on the able signed by the staff. That was so thoughtful of them to do that. We walked around downtown Celebration and did some shopping. It was such a quiet and quaint area. In the morning we walked around the trails and it was so peaceful.

Parking at the hotel is not free but we parked on the street which has no charge and a space was easy to find.

From the minute you are greeted at the door by Ron and his colleagues, you are made to feel at home. We had a lake view room and it was amazing to look back at Celebration with the twinkling lights at night, and the mist rising at sunrise - well worth the upgrade. We stayed last March and were there for St Patricks day - Celebration certainly lived up to its name! The craic was brilliant! We didn't want to drive, and so the hotel organised transport to the themeparks - Disney is only a few minutes drive, but the fare of c $25 is expensive as it includes the $14 vehicle charge that Disney load on all cars. There's a great range of restaurants in Celebration, as well as a selection of lively bars. We ate in the Thai a couple of time - highly recommended. We had one meal in the hotel on the night we arrived, and it was lovely albeit expensive. The town is built around a lake, with rocking chairs here and there in order to sit and watch the world go by. The locals are some of the friendliest I have ever met in the US - and that's saying a lot given Americans in general are so warm and welcoming ! I think Celebration is more for adults - perhaps children would miss the hustle and bustle of the resort hotels? Would we go back? Already booked and arriving next St Patricks Day!
