My scrambled eggs came on top of my pancakes which left them a soggy mess. About 1/4 of the orders were incorrect and when a couple joined us slightly later, it took nearly 45 minutes and three trips to the counter to get a cup of tea. The problem was with the server (yes one server), we were across several tables yet instead of treating us as small groups of 5-6 each, she tried to serve us as one large group which didn't work. People at the same table were done with their plates while the person next to them still had to wait 10-30 minutes for their food. A disorganized mess.

They had allocated us a large space which was great however the service for breakfast was TERRIBLE. The wait staff were beyond incompetent. It appeared we had been allocated one waitress who seemed to be on another planet and had trouble remembering an order of 4 coffees and 1 tea. There seemed to be no logical order in her taking our orders, getting the requests to the kitchen and getting the food out to us. There isn't an incredible amount to choose from on the breakfast menu so everyone had pretty much the same order yet those who ordered first didn't get theior food until last and the orders were mixed up/incorrect when delivered. Minimum wait for food was easily half an hour minimum and it wasn't particularly warm on arrival, this was also the case for a cup of tea for one of the guests. No apologies from the wait staff instead they chose to blame the chef or lack of one, however it wasn't the chef taking the orders! More wait staff appeared but things didn't really improve. The manager didn't apologise either also citing staff pressures. Forgive me for thinking that an apology, even if you don't really mean it, is just common courtesy. Due to the terrible service we requested a discount in the bill and were given 20% off as a result of our complaints. This did not apply however to those of us who had paid for breakfast as part of our room rate.

We then came down later to the diner for a drink and were sat in the lounge and was served by a young lady called lacy. The diner had a buzzing atmosphere and we could see a party at the back who were all dressed up as characters from Grease. It was all very nice to see a theme of the diner for a party....i wish i had my pink ladies jacket with me lol. When we came back later that evening we were greeted again in a very polite manner by the diner manager. After one of the best sleeps in a very long time, 4 kids say no more, we ventured down to the diner for our breakfast, we were greeted by the diner manager who was working last night, he was very friendly and smiley, even though he must'nt have had any more than 6 hours sleep. We were sat in the window on a booth which was really comfortable and after having a good look around the decor itself is WOW, this place does have that factor and originality that so many other places lack. Our waitress Nikki took our order, after a few minutes our coffee turned up but we had to ask for our orange juice to which she apologised and got for us. The breakfast which was a full english and a salmon and eggs was dbl WOW, the breakfast was hot, with a gorgeous tasting sausage, and heinz beans!! only thing is the bacon was a litle not to my partners tasting, as it looked like it had been boiled and was a bit too smoked, the salmon and eggs was scrumptious, i love the use of cream in the eggs, im going to be doing that at home now. One observation we did make is that the kitchen did seem a little all over the place, at one point there were 5 chefs behind the counter, i did see the diner manager go round and kick them out into the back area.
