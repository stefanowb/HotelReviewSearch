After a 10 hour flight from New York, we arrived in Oahu and picked up our rental car and hit the H1 where there was a ton of rush hour traffic. For my first time in Hawaii, Oahu was not what I expected. It is not very tropical looking in Honolulu and I felt somewhat disappointed. When we arrived at the Ko 'Olina exit, I finally felt like I had finally arrived in Hawaii. The area where Aulani is is very beautiful and lush. There are homes at the golf course and time share hotels as well. When we arrived at Aulani we had our car valet parked and were greeted with leis that smelled amazing! The hotel is beautiful and meticulously maintained.

When we checked in our requested room for a king bed and queen pullout was not available but we were able to switch the next day to a different room which had the beds we originally requested. Even though our room overlooked the parking garage, we had a beautiful view of the mountains and ocean in the distance. The rooms were well kept and very nice. Sometimes housekeeping came later in the day (after 4:00) which was sometimes an inconvenience but not a big deal for us. I had stopped by Target one day and bought supplies to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and instant oatmeal and muffins for breakfast as my daughter and I are not big breakfast eaters. My husband would get something from the continental breakfast area at the Olelo room which he always enjoyed. Sometimes we would go next door to the Starbucks in the Marriott as well. We bought the refillable mugs ($18. each) which you can fill up throughout the day with coffee, tea, hot chocolate, soda and water. We ate lunch most days by the pool using waiter service and did different things for dinner. We ate on property a few nights. One night we ate at Ama Ama which we found to be excellent, once at the buffet which was good and also at the Olelo room happy hour between 5-7 where we had good food and musical entertainment. Our favorite dinner spot though was at Roys across the street at the gold course. The food was outstanding (and pricey). We ate there twice!! You may want to make a reservation but they do take walk-ins as well. The drinks at the hotel were good, not very strong and the waiter service was very convenient at the pool and on the beach. Be sure to get the shaved ice a few times as well!", "user": "Joseph K", "date": "October 26, 2013", "id": 182450028}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "In regards to reserving seats at the pool, make sure you get them early if you want a particular spot or an umbrella. My husband is an early riser and got us seats each day. The staff does watch the chairs and will remove your belongings after an hour as we witnessed happen to others. If you see your towels folded up, that means they are keeping tabs on how long you haven't been using your chairs. As long as you unfold your towels, the chairs are still yours for a while longer. We made sure to check back at our seats every so often as to not have a problem. One guy even kept a chart of where you were sitting and how long you were gone! If for some reason you have a late start, you will definitely find chairs on the deck in front of Ama Ama. There were always empty chairs there and a beautiful view of the ocean. Don't forget each day to get a different wrist band at the towel stands so they know you are a guest there. The color changes each day. Towel stand opens around 8:00am. Also, get clean towels before you head up to your room each night so you have them to put on your chairs in the morning to reserve them.", "title": "Getting Better Every Day", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Rsauer3473", "date": "October 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 182136271}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "As far as entertainment, especially for our 12 year old, there is plenty to do. The pools, lazy river and water slides were a lot of fun. Be sure to try them at night as well! Lazy river and slides are open until 8:00 and the pool closes at 10:00. Sometimes you have to wait on lines, but never more than 15 minutes. My daughter did 2 premium activities (extra expense around $80. each) in Aunty's beach house. She attended Surf's Up with Chip and Dale and Fish are Friends. Both were 3 hours and included a meal and gifts at the end. Even though she was one of the oldest at each activity, she had a great time. I booked these activities a month in advance as they usually are sold out early. I also booked the character breakfast and Ama Ama a month before we arrived to ensure the days and times I wanted. We all paid to snorkel in Rainbow Reef for the length of stay (this is only $5. more than the single day price). Try to go in during fish feeding as it's a wonderful experience! We also snorkeled in the lagoon in front of Aulani and to the lagoon to the left of Aulani's property. There are 4 lagoons in all that are calm and have tons of sea life to see. We did find another snorkeling area to the right of Aulani past the Marriott kind of off the beaten path. If you go there wear something on your feet as the terrain can be rocky. The area in the water is very rocky as well so be careful getting in. This was our favorite snorkeling spot of all as there is a ton to see! The sunsets at that spot are also spectacular. We tried paddle boarding one day and that was fun. I believe it was $30. for an hour and it is first-come first-served, no sign-up available. My daughter also did the Menehune Adventure Trail which is an interactive game throughout the resort. It is free to play between 10-7 but you need your room card to sign out the device to use. This can be found in the Pau Hana room. If you have done the Kim Possible game in EPCOT or have been on the Disney cruise, you will be familiar with the format of the game.
