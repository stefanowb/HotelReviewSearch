Our spotlessly clean and spacious downstairs rooms overlooked spectacular and breathtaking scenery and the pleasure this afforded was more than matched by the excellence of the food and table service at dinner and breakfast each day. Susie was the epitome of kind concern and helpfulness, whilst Karl excelled himself in preparing a variety of menus which would not be out of place in the very best and most expensive city restaurants. All the staff were similarly attentive and made dining there an absolute delight, even Dale the dog being made to feel especially welcome.

Her tolerance of our very drunken gushing over the wonderfulness of the pub was quite remarkable!

We have also stayed in the downstairs rooms which both have stunning views over the beautiful Dorset countryside. Karl's food is absolutely superb - he is a very talented chef indeed, we just hope he doesn't move on anywhere else too soon. Fish in particular is excellent, also the partridge with home made, perfectly seasoned bread sauce and fantastic creamed cabbage with bacon and cobnuts was probably the best game I have ever eaten - and I eat loads of it! The pudding of burnt cream with rhubarb icecream and shortbread was the stuff of dreams. The pub is also perfectly located in a quiet picture book vilage, complete with chiming church clock, rose festooned cottages and rolling hills.

After commenting to waitress that we felt the Greek style salad was extremely small for the \u00a310 price tag we were shocked to be offered more chips or bread instead. Their attitude to our quiet and polite comments were appalling and eventually our meals were taken away and returned with quartered tomatoes slung on top. We were eating in the beer garden at the rear of the pub and felt that they only just tolerated the two small children we had with us Can now understand why the pub was so quiet on a Sunday lunchtime in the middle of the holiday season. Normally we would have had to book for a table here over a year ago. Such a shame.", "title": "family sunday lunch!!!!
