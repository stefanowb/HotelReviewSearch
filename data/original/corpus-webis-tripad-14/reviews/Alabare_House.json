We were told it was a Christian facility, but had no conference going on right now. Being heathens, we were a little hesitant but in a hurry to find a room. The price was reasonable, but not cheap. When we checked in we learned that we would be charged 5% extra for using a credit card. Our room was huge, comfortable, and very clean. The bathroom contained a bottle of liquid hand soap. That was the sum total of amenities provided--not even a bar of soap! Location was actually quite handy to Salisbury sights, bus and train stations. With luggage it was best to take a taxi from the train station. We found the owner who checked us in to be a bit distant, but he did warm up at breakfast time next day. Breakfast was full English and quite good. Generally, it was very quiet, being set back off the street. Our room was on the second floor not far from the entryway and facing the driveway. Except for latecomers who talked outside the entry and cars on the crushed stone, it really was quiet.", "title": "Bring your own shampoo!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Dincy", "date": "October 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5950934}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled solo", "text": "I've stayed for one night in Alabare guesthouse.
