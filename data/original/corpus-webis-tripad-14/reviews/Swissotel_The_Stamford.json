I originally chose this hotel because of the location and the good rate i was given.However when I went to check in i noticed that the rate was actually much higher then what i was told. They add extra tax that you dont know about until you get the bill.Dont believe the pictures on the website, the rooms look NOTHING like this!! I was given a room on the 56th floor and was promised a riverview, instead I got views of building work,suntec city and a quarter of the river! A few times i found little ants crawling round near the bedside cabinet, apart from this the room was clean. I expected so much better for a 5 star and was very dissapointed. the reception staff were not very helpful. breakfast was average, there should be more choice.The best part about this hotel is the excellent location, City hall MRT is right on the doorstep and suntec city a few mins walk.Overall i wouldnt stay here again, for the same money you can stay at a much better hotel. i would rate this hotel an average 3 star.", "title": "Very dissapointing for a 5 star hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "member078", "date": "September 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3901221}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "The stay was meant to be a menigful stay as I was supposed to celebrate National Day,", "title": "Average services--dissapointing for a 5 star hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Singapore12345", "date": "August 11, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3754551}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "5 star", "text": "The check-in was extremely slow although there were only a few guest.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 7, 2005", "id": 3742389}], "location": {"country": "Singapore", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 118, "average": 351, "very good": 1061, "terrible": 60, "excellent": 1298}, "aka": "Swissotel The Stamford Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0902777777778, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Conveniently located in the heart of Singapore, Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford is a deluxe hotel that boasts a prime Singapore location amid the diversions of the Raffles City shopping complex and just 20 minutes away from Singapore Changi International Airport.
