I did not make an advance reservation at the Hibiscus, but with good fortune I found this peaceful haven in Grayton Beach. My room, the hibiscus room, was the cheapest at $120 a night. As a budget minded traveller, I found this area overall to be quite expensive so the rate was a pretty good value considering that a filling, healthy and yummy vegetarian breakfast was included. If you are not an early riser like me, I would recommend that you do NOT choose one of the rooms above the cafe. The cafe begins bustling at 7am and may disturb those who enjoy sleeping late or seeking quiet space. The facilities (bed, bath, internet connection) were all good. It was a little chilly the first night as my room did not have its own heater. Fortunately, I had the place to myself so I turned up the heat in an adjacent room. I found my room to be the perfect size for a solo traveller, maybe too small if you are travelling with a spouse or friend. The mature, natural landscape that surrounds the inn is fantastic. The friendly staff are available during the day. After hours is available by phone. --- Grayton Beach is sandwiched between Destin/Miramar beach to the west which is bustling and crowded.
