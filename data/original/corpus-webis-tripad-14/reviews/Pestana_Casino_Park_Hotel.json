We were told by the first choice leader on the bus that check in wasn't until 2pm Got to the hotel, to check in- and were told that our room wasnt ready until 2.45. We werent too happy with this, as our luggage was nowhere to be seen either as first choice had shipped it in another bus. We waited around for our luggage for about an hour, to change and pop into get some lunch and it was only when we asked that they told us our luggage was already there, and had been taken to our room. Some families checking in were told they had to wait until 5pm for their room, so we were fortunate in a way. If First choice, or the hotel would have explained to us this procedure our holiday would have gone to a much better start. That was our biggest fault with the hotel on a whole. The rooms were brilliant, and breakfast was great. We didnt use the restaurant and bar, as we opted to go into funchal instead. You did feel however that the hotel was a little confused as to what its function was. It was large, and most of it unused. We played table tennis, and used the gym and pool-these were all good facilities. I was baffled that the hotel charged 15Euros to use the tennis court-something i refused to do in a 5* hotel, this should be included. As a whole it is a good hotel, some aspects 5* but not all, more of a 4*. It sits in a good location to funchal.", "title": "a confused 5*", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "elinmai", "date": "September 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 117826395}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Hotel is situated just on the tip of the town centre on a hill-not too steep.", "title": "Mixed feelings", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "carolinecasablanca", "date": "September 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117633150}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel is huge and looks impressive upon arrival, but of Vegas feel to it.", "title": "5 STAR HOTEL??? 2 STAR SERVICE!!!!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "happyhollsCannock", "date": "September 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 117631092}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Corridors are big, dimly lit and bit eery..distant music playing adds to the spooky feel!", "title": "perfect holiday", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "winny190832", "date": "September 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117600624}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Rooms on the back of the hotel have to endure lots of noise such as a generator noises ?

Thankfully when we arrived there it was nothing of the sort. Plenty of space to sit around if you didn't want to go out or sit in your room. Seating areas on each floor close to the lifts which were ideal when it got too hot. Room was spacious and very clean with a balcony giving great views over the ocean and the early morning views as Funchal awoke were wonderful. Staff are excellent, very friendly and professional, nothing is too much trouble. We are glad we chose to come here for our silver wedding anniversary. Although we would certainly stay here again we wouldn't eat here, we found the food not up to a standard expected of a 5 star hotel. Hotel is a shortl walk to the marina and not too far from the lido area. Amongst some of the trips we did was a catamaran trip to go whale watching, 4 sightings in all, absolutely brilliant. Penty to see and do. Funchal is certainly worth a visit. There are plenty of restaurants - 2 we definitely would recomment are Forte de Sao Tiago and Solar da Ajuda, both with excellent staff, food and service.", "title": "HOTEL REALLY GOOD, FOOD NOT SO GOOD", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PlymouthDevondreamer", "date": "September 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117942617}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "For a 5 star hotel at the lower end of the budget, pestana Caslon park is a great hotel.

Evening buffet dinner 27euro 29inculding drinks, beer 3euros for a pint of the local beer \"Corel\".

A gem of modern architecture before its name became mud. Thanks to the inspired design of architect Oscar Niemeyer (of Brasilia fame) every room has a generous balcony and a great view, whether of the sea and cliffs or the magnificent amphitheatre of Funchal, which turns into a sparkling light show at night. Breakfast is in a wonderful light-filled double-height restaurant or you can sit outside overlooking the infinity pool. The staff were very helpful (but never intrusive).

We were on B&B so ate out every night & found some amazing restaurants. We went into Funchal but didn't enjoy the restaurants there as much as the ones found to the back of the hotel. there is a new Turkish restaurant under the Irish bar Moynahans which was our favourite it had only been opened a week & the food was fresh & plentiful. Also check out Mal Brandos' further up the road. All the restaurants up this road were busy so either go early or book. We didn't take any scheduled trips with coach company we opted for a taxi to take us around the north & east of the island for a fraction of the cost.
