When we left to go to the wedding party they drove us there in the hotel car as there were no taxis.

The sommelier... On the night we weren\u2019t chasing dims sums (see below), we ate at the hotel restaurant. Panoramic views of the city and harbour! Fantastic food! Extensive and impressive wine list! So we decided to enlist the services of the sommelier to navigate. She asked us for our wine preferences, meal selection and went off to prepare a matched wine for each of our courses. This is where it went downhill, the first wine was exactly what we asked not to have, but was a favourite of hers. Round two... d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! After we very politely reminded her of our preferences, she returned with replacement wines this time and provided tasting measures. Before we could taste she walked off and was not seen again, before even filling our glasses. We felt, realising her tip was no longer with us, she shunned our table and provided no further service. We had to seek the help of other waiters to top the glasses and provide the remaining wines with our meals.
