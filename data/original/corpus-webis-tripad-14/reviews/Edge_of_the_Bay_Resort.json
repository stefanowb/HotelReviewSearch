We had just come from a beautiful cottage in Stewarts Bay (for considerably less) to Edge of the Bay. The cottage itself is adequate and clean, however it is very old. The whole cottage would shake when the wind picked up. We ate in the restaurant which was very nice. I was really annoyed by the attitude of one staff member. There was no explanation of what to do in the area or around the resort when we arrived. I was made to feel like I was wasting her time when I had to ask so many questions. We stayed four nights here and although we all loved the area and the amazing walks around Freycinet National Park, I'm sure I could find better accommodation next time.", "title": "A bit ordinary", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Tasman2010", "date": "January 24, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 54209221}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The Edge of the Bay Resort classes itself as a resort.

It took us a day to come down from our expectation of a bit of glamour and tune into the comfortable feel. The cottage was fine: adequate kitchen, laundry, TV/in-house movies and DVD. Our cottage had two bedrooms one with bunks and the other queen bed. No soundproofing at all - walls are paper thin between the bedrooms. The standout were the wallabies that visited, the possums, the beach which was a 30 second walk from our cottage. The tennis court was first class (balls were not). No gym. Bikes for kids plentiful. Restaurant looked good but we ate in. The 'resort' is 10 minutes drive from the town. Ideally placed on the beach and makes for a pleasant walk to the main town - which is really a village. Cottage did not receive daily room service. Drinking water was collected from rain water tank - needed to be boiled. The resort (from a cottage perspective) felt more like a eco-resort.

We stayed in one of the 2 bed \u201cfamily\u201d style cabins. Overall we found them to be functional and clean... fairly dated (15 year old appliances... Baltic pine panelling wall to wall and plenty of beige surfaces and the bathroom was the low light \u2013 tiny little shower), but you had to balance this with the tremendous view you got from the windows and decked area... and after all, you don't come to Freycinet for state of the art showering and a nice fridge. The food in the restaurant was decent, but too expensive for the standard offered. Overall we enjoyed our stay but the place felt a little unloved and there certainly weren't any special touches that would make it stand out \u2013 and there are many places delivering more for the same money these days...
