Firstly part of the reason we booked the hotel was due to the fact it had a pool. In reality the \"pool\" is a 2 metre by 2 metre square stuck in a tight corner on the 7th floor of the hotel which we refered to as \"the cattle dip\". There was no seating or loungers around the\"pool\" and only 5 or 6 sun loungers crushed into a tiny area just below and to the left of the \"pool\" area with two umbrellas which meant, due to the size of the space, that even if you were able to get a seat up there - which would mean queuing for the door to be unlocked at 9.30am, then quite often you could not actually get out of the sun once it was at a certain position in the sky. For a hotel which has a \"pool\" as one of it\u00b4s main selling points I\u00b4m not sure that the area actually provided to guests qualifies, especially given the number of hotel rooms and so guests to the actually facilities offered. The free mini bar also sounded great but realistically all it contains is a couple of small bottles of water, coca cola and some non-alcoholic beer. Once you take into account the fact that the pool and mini bar promise is not quite what it seems you are left feeling particularly peeved when the hotel staff tell you they do not have an iron or ironing board in the whole hotel and that you have to pay the extra to use the hotel laundry facilities.

The room is very minimalist, to the point that there is so little lighting I spent most of the time in my room feeling like a mole as I scratched around to try and find things in the dark. Finally the bathroom was so small and built in such a wierd shape that you had to close the door just to get to the toilet, only the door didn\u00b4t propery close.
