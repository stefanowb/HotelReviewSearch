Front desk gave us ethernet cable but that didn't solve problem - we didn't have problem at other hotels this week so not our laptop. Staff did say system being upgraded but for 5 days? Otherwise I find Holiday Inns a good place to say if it weren't for the sheets. Also bathtub has not traction at all so slippery but many hotels are like that I find.

It didn't hurt that we were offered a pretty good group rate that included continental breakfast. Check in was quick at 6pm on a Thursday. we had a corner room on the 3rd floor (the top floor). Don't expect a view. The room was decent size with a small fridge and a microwave. Decent drawer and closet space. The bathroom was great as it had a large stall shower with glass door. Good water pressure. Alot of space on the vanity for stuff. The only thing that was missing was a magnifying mirror. The bed was comfortable but I cannot understand why some hotels still use very small pillows. These actually had signs on them that said \"firm\" and \"soft\" but I couldn't tell the difference. The air conditioner was another story. When it went on, it sounded like a jet plane taking off. It was very very loud. Also the location of the fan and blower was right below the window not far from the bed. Since it was so low, the cold air blew directly onto the person on that side of the bed. There was free wifi so we brought our laptop. Unfortunately, the reception was spooty, it worked well some of the time, then it would just turn off. As for the hotel itself, there were two elevators for three floors and we never had to wait long for one. My team would meet every day behind the lobby and sit in the comfortable sofas and chairs. The pool area, though small, seemed clean and pleasant. Even though the hotel is non-smoking, I did notice a smoking area by a table at the back end of the pool area. I don't know if that would affect anyone in the pool. The continental breakfast was good with juices, bagels, muffins, yogurt, cereals, etc. They even had a soda dispenser which I like because I get my caffeine int eh morning from coke or pepsi instead of coffee. If you wanted a hot breakfast, for $3 more, you could make yourself a waffle or have french toast, scrambled eggs, bacon. As for location, it worked for us but it is about 25 minutes away from the beaches. Not that much right around the hotel. If you're a golfer, LPGA is just down the street.
