By this time I had a cranky 1 year old. When it arrived after 8:30 the staff who delivered it was knocking on the wrong door so I looked in the hall and she just kind of pushed it at me and said nothing when I said \"thanks\" a bit knit picky on the reply but it's common manners to respond. The bathroom door lock was broken, call it a habbit but I lock a bathroom door when I go in, when I came out I didn't want the baby going in there so I closed it behind me. This locked the bathroom door. When I called room service we didn't see anyone for 50 minutes. I called back down to remind them of our bathroom door being broken, the little push buttom on the inside of the door was missing so you could press your finger into the inside and lock it but it wouldn't reset when you opened the bathroom door from the inside. We tried using a coin to open it ourselves but this didn't work. After the second call an engineer staff person came up and opened the door for us but did not fix the door so later that night when we closed the door it locked. My wife was embarrased so she didn't want me to call down about the bathroom again so we said forget it. The headboard of the bed was etched glass but behind the glass was a thick film of cotton dust lint and the occassional curly hair. The room on the 18th floor looked at the new Twins stadium, the Twins were in Cinncinatti but the lights from the park were turned on at 9:30 or so and it was like someone had pulled up to the window with their headlights on until after 11:30 I think. Not their fault but just something to be aware of during baseball season. I think it was the series of events and the fact that I thought I would have a suite that turned me off. I would probably say it was a 1.5 stars but I'll defer to lower rating because the memory is fresh. I've never wrote a review before and I believe this is a fair rating.

From the second you walk in, you are greeted by a very friendly doorman, and the front desk will very happily accommodate your needs. In fact, there is no ice maker accessible by the hotel guests, instead you just call down and they deliver it to your room--the longest I ever waited for this was maybe 2-3 minutes. The beds were comfortable, my only complaint is that one night it was difficult to sleep because a Timberwolves game had just gotten over and the noise from the street traffic is fairly loud. The main reason I say this place is good but not great is because there really isn't anything special about it--the room is a very average size and some of the furniture shows signs of wear and tear. The decor is very chic but also seems to be hastily assembled. Some of my favorite things about this place were the very large main TV, the TV in the bathroom, the lounger in the corner, and the very comfortable bedding.

I ask to be moved to another room, only to be told \"the only thing we might be able to do is get someone to clean a dirty room for you--which means it may take awhile\"--it's 11pm at night so I decline. Why are there dirty rooms at 11pm if the hotel is full? I again call the front desk in HOPES of getting a different staff person than the rude young man who checked me in, and a young lady quickly finds my Wyndham Rewards # for me in their database. Thanks go out to her for being the only adequate Customer Service interaction this entire stay.Wow, OK. I go to sleep with no Jet Shower or TV, awake in the morning, and open my door to grab the USA Today I assume will be there--you guessed it, it isn't. Nice. I was at the Graves in April on business for 2 nights, and had poor Customer Service from the front desk at that visit as well: my group arrived in MN late on a Tuesday and we asked the front desk where we could go to eat dinner, a full menu, since we were starving. We were told \"the Irish Pub next door\". So we walk in the cold and rain only to be told the kitchen is already closed. Now wouldn't a hotel like the Graves have staff trained in knowing simple things like where to direct your guests to eat late in the evening? Both people at the front that night in April were both clueless. Unbelievable. Graves, I like your beds, I come for the Jet Shower, but I don't think i will return. I'm working with my Corporate travel to look at other options, like The Grand. Your decor is very posh, your bar is trendy and your gym is open 24/7, which is nice. But your room amenities and staff are poor and I cannot chance yet another stay like my last two. I don't know if you've had a change in Management or high staff turn over, but it shows.
