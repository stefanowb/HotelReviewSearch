Not alone is it extremely good value, it\u2019s also a little quirky inside and out with each of their 10 guest rooms furnished and decorated differently. You can literally park your car outside your room, and outside each is a table and chairs so one can sit back and relax weather permitting! The owners of this hotel are incredibly helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them. At night, the outside of the hotel is lit up by fairy lights which give the hotel a very romantic feel. The room was extremely comfortable and very quiet, it was extremely spacious. Our breakfast was lovely and was delivered at a time convenient for us, had we wanted any extra tea or coffee, all we had to do was call and they would provide us with more.", "title": "A 5 Star Gem at 2 Star Prices", "user": "mgirishrover", "date": "October 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 47305702}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Stay Here- It was our Favorite", "text": "This really is a beautiful hotel and I\u2019m slightly baffled that they only have a 2 star rating.

The Hotel Monet is just a short walk to village. Christoph and Sylvie could not have been kinder. It is vine covered and adorable. We had a large and comfortable room with large bathroom, very clean.

But do not let that put you off. The location is very quiet, away from the buzz of Honfleur's centre, and you can park your car there...it's a five to seven minute walk to the centre. Parking in central Honfleur is (a) very difficult and (b) expensive. The rooms are large by French standards, simply but tastefully furnished and well-equipped. The welcome from Christophe, Sylvie and their staff is excellent and breakfast, served in your room (there is no restaurant) is delightful.
