The elevator ran quickly and we were always able to get it without a long wait (we were on the second floor). Parking outside the hotel was close to the lobby. This is a very nice hotel and one of the cleanest we ahve ever stayed in. As a side note we were there a day after July 4th and we noticed many colorful fourth of July decrorations throughout the hotel.", "title": "Greta Hotel", "user": "texaswillie", "date": "July 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5434127}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Marion"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 20, "very good": 40, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 39}, "aka": "Hampton Inn Marion Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5625, "description": "Unwind and relax at the Hampton Inn Marion, IL hotel, where you can enjoy Kokopelli golf course, catch a Southern Illinois Miners game, or take a dip in Crab Orchard Lake.
