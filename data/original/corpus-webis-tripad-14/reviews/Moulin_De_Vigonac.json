When we did find it we were really delighted and our welcome was perfect - thank you Oliver and the Alexeline famille. Our room was lovely, clean, spacious and bright with a little balcony to sit on and near all the facilities including the pool and garden. This room was Camille. The car was parked just outside so very handy if like us you have lots of luggage and bits and pieces in the car. Initially I was concerned about the walk to the town - but there's no need to worry at all - it's not far and quite a pleasant off-road green route you follow to end up in the centre by the river. I would recommend staying there in the evening as this has to be one of the most enjoyable meals I had in our two weeks in France. The level of cooking and presentation was fantastic for the money and included a whole lobster for my starter - which was a special - but if it's on the menu do not hesitate for a moment! The gardens and park were really fantastic and very calm and quiet. And I almost forgot to mention it - I think also the best breakfast too.

We gratefully accepted this and enjoyed the small balcony overlooking the mill wheel and the sun through our windows. Both rooms were delightful and spacious. Dinner in the evening offered a choice of menus at 45 euros or 65 euros, but we chose from the a la carte and chose lobster salad followed by a plate of assorted cheeses. The lobster was a whole lobster each and was prepared beautifully, making it so easy to eat every morsel. It cost 32 euros but surpassed anything we had experienced elsewhere. Our menu choice was excellent as we were served complimentary canap\u00e9s, an amuse bouche and petit fours desserts in addition to our lobster and cheese.
