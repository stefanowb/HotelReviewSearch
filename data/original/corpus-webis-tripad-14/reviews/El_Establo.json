The hotel itself is HUGE, but we stayed in one of the buildings closer to reception, the restaurant, etc. The rooms themselves are well appointed - clean, neat, BIG bathrooms (which are not very well lit and also have small ventilation windows that go out into the hallway - meaning that you can hear people in the bathrooms as you walk by their rooms - a little odd), very comfortable. The hotel also has internet access (which you do have to pay for) pools, a spa, all kinds of stuff. We did a night tour with a guide that was only so-so and some of the staff (aside from the reception staff) were a little rude to us, but all in all it was a positive experience. They also had a nice breakfast in the morning and a \"happy hour\" that was sparsely attended, but still fun for us. From what I have heard, in a town of backpacker hotels and eco-lodges, this is by far the most luxurious of them all - so if you want luxury while experiencing the beautiful Cloud Forest, this is the place to stay!", "title": "Beautiful hotel!", "user": "LJWNYC2008", "date": "December 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 51467763}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "Terrific hotel on the side of a mountain.

Hotel was not crowded estimate less than 20%. We were automatically upgraded on check-in to two level suite with 2 king beds. Rooms were clean with view of town, there were some bugs on window, had sliding glass door to balcony without screen. The rooms had lots of windows and in Am let light in. This was ok as morning activities planned. Also, not a lot of insulation between rooms and hall (bathroom vent to hall) so heard hall noise at night. The resort has 2 swimming pools, tennis court, spa and walking trails with zip lines (lots of activities and buildings). There is a shuttle bus available to take you around. The resort was empty. Wife and daughter used the spa and had excellent massage and seaweed bath for a decent price. The morning buffet breakfast (included in room rate) was ok (not the best food and no omelette station). The breakfast food may have been a reflection of the low occupancy. Even though the hotel was empty, the front desk hassled us about late check out. Definitely bring raincoat as rains a lot. Check out the Monteverde Cloud Forrest while there, as we did AM guided tour ($34 pp including park feee arranged at park) \u2013 was very good (Roberto Wesson \u2013 mwesson@yahoo.com). Had dinner at Sophia\u2019s cross the street and down a block was excellent. Also, wife and daughter did Selvature Canopy Tours had a blast (picked and dropped off at hotel). Whole town was empty as tourism is down . Check out German Bakery in Santa Elena. Roads to Monteverde kind of challenge \u2013 steep and dirt; I would not try at night as occasional cattle and no guard rails with big drop offs \u2013 SUV needed. Internet down while there.
