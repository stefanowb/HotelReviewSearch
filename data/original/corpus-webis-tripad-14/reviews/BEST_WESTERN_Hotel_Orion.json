You must visit Rudas baths which are very close to the hotel and for food, we ate twice at Aranyszarvas (behind hotel across the road) and it was the best food we had in Budapest, excellent wine too, try the Takler Bikav\u00e9r Reserve 2006, absolutely superb. 2 courses with wine for 2 is about 12000-15000 ft.

The folks during the day are generally very good and friendly. As another reviewer noted, the large man who works nights is not very friendly.

The shower was also very narrow and the showerhead incredibly difficult to use and control, although that may have just been a problem in our room. The area where the hotel is located, although convenient to transportation, has no charm at all. Also there is no place to go for a late nite meal; even the small convenience store across the street closes early, around 7 or 8pm. I did however discover that you can get Pizza Hut to deliver. In response to other reviews, I would say the hotel is a good 30-45 minute uphill walk to the top of Castle Hill and 20-30 minutes to cross the Erzabet bridge and get to Vaci utca. (The Central market is at the far east end of Vaci utca, maybe 6-7 blocks east of the Erzabet bridge). It is about a 15 minute walk to the Buda side of the Chain bridge and the adjacent funicular that takes you up to the Buda castle. Castle Hill is a few blocks away from the castle. Another way to get to Castle Hill is to take the bus from the foot of the Chain bridge.

As I see it, location is not one of the advantages of this hotel. In fact, it really doesn\u2019t matter where you stay in Budapest b/c the transportation system in Budapest is so good. The only shortcoming is if you are out after about 10pm. That\u2019s when service becomes extremely spotty. We were out late several nites and were frustrated b/c the signs at bus and tram stops do not say when service stops. So you have no idea whether another bus or tram is coming.

However if I were going back, I would pay more and stay at the Hilton in Castle Hill, an incredibly charming and romantic area. Or perhaps the Art\u2019otel at Bethany terrace. Bethany terrace is a nice area on the Buda side that faces directly towards Parliament. There is a nice restaurant (for lunch) behind the church on the square at Bethany terrace called Angelica. (This is a short public bus ride away). For dinner, there is a beautiful pedestrian-only street called Raday utca near the Kalvin ter metro with plenty of restaurants. We ate at the Pink Cadillac there; although the name makes it sound like a tacky tourist trap it is not, and the food (mostly Italian) was terrific. We also enjoyed both restaurants near the hotel; they are slightly more upscale, at least at dinner time. Whatever you do, if you\u2019re there for pleasure, make sure you devote a day to Castle Hill and Fisherman\u2019s Bastion. We also enjoyed shopping upstairs at the Central Market. The selection of items and prices here were the best we saw. You can take the 41 tram to the 6 tram and get there in 10-15 minutes.
