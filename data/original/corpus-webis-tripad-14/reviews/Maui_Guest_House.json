The quality was great then & has only improved since. The house is in a residential neighbourhood, about a 20 minute walk (or two minute drive) to the heart of Lahaina. It falls into the don't judge a book by its cover category. The neighbourhood is nothing special to see, nor is the guest house itself on first approach. But once inside, it is magnificent, with stained glass doorways, tiled flooring, and a personal soft tub for each of two back suites. Breakfast was ample - fresh fruit, cereal, bagels & English muffins. There were also store bought muffins which we didn't indulge in. Would have preferred locally made banana bread, but it's a small quibble. The staff are outstandingly helpful and fun. You immediately feel part of a family, but not in an intrusive way. We particularly liked the 9:00 pm quiet time. We could read quietly in our rooms and turn in at 10:00 pm without hearing anything but the sound of the geckos....The only true complaint was a squeaky sliding bathroom door & rather loud toilet (strange as that sounds).

They offer free range of the kitchen and a huge selection of food for a continental breakfast and dishes and condiments for any other in house eating you decide to do. There is a side hallway with an available washer and dryer with cupboards full of laundry supplies, picnic supplies, and all assorted sundries that you may have forgotten (lotion, suntan lotion, polish remover, sunburn ointment,etc). The shelves on the other side of the hall are stacked with nice huge beach towels. Extra towels are also stacked in the bathroom of each room. The closets hold a fan, ironing board, laundry basket and enough hangers for a month's stay. The room has nice adjustable lighting and speakers for the huge wall attached TV next to each side of the bed which allows a nice level of sound without blasting out into the house's common area. The jacuzzi in our room was in a seperate screened in lanai with both a sliding glass and screen door. This room and the jacuzzi were spotless; the afternoon and night breezes were fantastic if you wanted to use this as a reading room and the screen door allowed the breeze to flow into the bedroom.", "title": "A Paradise Tucked Away", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "PPTA", "date": "May 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130473496}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012", "text": "The deck area has tables and chairs as well as a grill if you want to BBQ and the sweetest salt water pool just perfect for a cool dip!", "title": "Cozy, clean, and everything we could ask for.", "user": "BruceMacD", "date": "May 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 130380504}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled solo", "text": "Beach chairs and all necessary snorkel gear as well as boogie boards are available; with the strip of beaches with in 5-10 min drive, these were well used.Snorkeling at Airport Beach was our favorite morning spot!", "title": "Aloha", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cabanaroad", "date": "April 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 128377568}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The help at the House while we were there were 2 of the nicest folks we have met: Barb and Jim were helpful without being in our way and yet always there to listen and share stories and information when we wanted to talk.", "title": "Very helpful staff!", "user": "MnVH", "date": "April 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127363164}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We truly were sad when we had to leave and if we ever get another trip to Maui will be sure to stay here again.", "title": "Maui's Little Secret", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BlackMurano", "date": "March 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127041694}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just spent 10 nights at the Maui Guest House and we completely enjoyed our stay.
