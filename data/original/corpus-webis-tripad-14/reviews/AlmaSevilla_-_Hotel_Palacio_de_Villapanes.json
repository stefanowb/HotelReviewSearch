Between the bedroom and the bath area there is a desk but that is right next to the bath with no door separating it which is rather strange. The bedroom overlooks a pretty courtyard and is nice and quiet except that they play 'muzac' all day which is annoying if you have the window open. The beds are very comfortable and the bedding good quality. There was no specific area to put suitcases so they ended up on the chair or on the desk which we felt would damage them. The first night the air-con was set at 19 degrees which was far too hot for us and we had to have the window wide open overnight. After asking for it to be dealt with that evening we had to wait until the next day after we made it very clear that it had to be dealt with urgently and they set it at 16 which was better. It would appear that the controls in the room are not capable of being adjusted by the guest which is crazy for a 5* hotel. We had to ask twice for the free mini bar to be restocked and also for the tv to be reset to allow us to view all 50 channels to include English ones rather than the 10 we encountered on arrival which were all foreign.

The rooms were gorgeous, the staff was by far the friendliest, and most helpful of any of the hotels that I stayed at in Spain. My room had juliette balconies which meant that I could fully open the doors at night which overlooked the courtyard.

It is a jewel that shines brilliantly, taking us back to the Mudejar period, uniquely important to the city\u2019s history. It was originally built in the early years of the 18th century by Don Manuel L\u00f3pez Pintado, the first Marquis of Torreblanca del Aljarafe. It has recently been refurbished, and today art, design and culture, as well as a decor tending towards the minimalist, enable guests to discover and enjoy a different Seville."}
