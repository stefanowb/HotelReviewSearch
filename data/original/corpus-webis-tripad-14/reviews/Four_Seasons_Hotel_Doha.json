It was just lovely. The service is fantastic and the Spa is absolutely amazing. Pools are great and the private beach is a winner. It's not a crowded place and you really feel like you can unwind here. The spa/pool staff are really amazing. The pool and beach experience was finished off with an amazing Swiss shower in the stunning spa change rooms. We ate at the buffet and had some nice food - it wasn't the best meal I've had in Doha, but it wasn't bad. Also had a coffee in the Tea Room, and that was 1st class. The snacks and sweets are really good here and we probably enjoyed that more than the buffet. As for the rooms; exactly what you'd expect from the Four Seasons. Clean, comfortable, great bed and pillows for a really good sleep and top quality French soaps & shampoos. This is probably one of the best hotels in Doha and I would recommend it to anyone.", "title": "Beautiful Hotel", "user": "SpecialTV", "date": "May 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 109891808}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled on business", "text": "A recent trip combining business for my spouse and leisure for us both allowed us to stay in this hotel for ten days. From the moment we were greeted at the airport with a sedan to the hotel, to the moment the sedan returned me to the airport our stay at the Four Seasons exceeded our greatest expectations. Each time we entered the hotel we were greeted with a cheerful welcome back! When we asked for our car each time we arrived at the front of the hotel the car was running with the air conditioning system turned on and ready to go. What a camel ride? Talk to the concierge. Need to send something by FedEx, again immediately and efficiently dealt with. Want a massage? Lovely massage therapists from Bali provide excellent therapeutic massage. They have the best and largest therapeutic pool that I have ever used. Lovely outdoor pools, including a children's pool with a double dinosaur slide and two hot tubs. Want to sun on the beach? Beach staff will cover your chaise, arrange an umbrella, and bring an igloo cooler with ice and bottled water.
