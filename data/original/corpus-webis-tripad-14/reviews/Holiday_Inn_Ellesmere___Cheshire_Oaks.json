(We had hoped to go to Chester but it was Race week so couldn't get booked in). I phoned to book and the receptionist told me how well located it was for shopping and told me various eating places nearby. They only had a double room with a sofa bed, but said she would see if she could swap us round. On arrival they had managed to get us two double beds which was perfect, and the view over the locks was lovely. We even got a complimentary bottle of wine! Not sure why & I did let reception know in case it had been put in the our room by mistake, but when I told them they said it we could have it anyway! We mentioned to housekeeping after first night that we found the pillows a bit hard, so she arranged 'squishy' pillows for us which were perfect. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. The setting was lovely (although sunny weather probably helps!) and it was perfectly located for Cheshire Oaks, trains into Liverpool and Chester (although we didn't bother in the end we were having such a lovely chill out time). We only ate breakfasts at the hotel but they were freshly cooked and the tables were cleared straight away. The only thing we didn't realise was breakfast on Sunday was until 11am so we could have had an extra hour in bed! This trip was a birthday treat for us both, we always knoew we'd enjoy ourselves wherever we were, but the hotel exceeded our expectations - we had a fabulous time.", "title": "Great hotel in good location with lovely friendly staff", "user": "MorecambeLuigi", "date": "May 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 30210463}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Brilliant hotel.
