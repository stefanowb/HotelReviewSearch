No one told me this hotel was being taken over by a Jewish event and the kitchen was kosher. So no breakfast for me. Also, the vending machines were unplugged and covered and the pool was closed to their functions. This will be going on until 4/14. No one told me prior and I booked a month in advance. Don't stay here, staff was rude, parking though complimentary was a pain as they do valet and charge for the nightclub so it's a pain to park.
