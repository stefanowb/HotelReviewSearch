As do most families, we visited Anaheim purely for the Disneyland experience and after choosing to stay at Homewood after reading many favorable reveiws on Trip Advisor it didnt take long to realise that this place lived up to everything that we had read on TA. The two young guys on reception have the best customer service skills I have ever come across, extremely friendly and very willing to help as were the rest of the staff including the lady who served us complimentary beers during the managers reception/dinner. The free meals (Managers reception & Breakfast) were more than adequate, anyone who complains about the quality of what is dished up is simply being unreasonable, ok it is served on throw away plates with plastic cutlery but dont forget... it isnt 5 star but for the price you pay and for what you get, it realy is an absolute bargain. We stayed in 5 star at the next place we visited for the next few nights after checking out of Homewood and there was simply NO comparision.

When I booked the hotel, the only room available was a 2-queen room, so I requested a 1-king room which they were able to accommodate. The breakfast and dinner that is included really helped control expenses and while it wasn't the most amazing tasting, it was decent food and there were a lot of choices.

We stayed at the Homewood suite in Orlando Florida and booked this one because of our great experience in Florida. The staff were really friendly, but definitely under staffed. The phones in the rooms (and I say roomS because we were in a few) didn't work. And because the main elevator was so slow we had to run up and down the stairs to ask the front desk a question. Also used the stairs daily to leave and return from the hotel. There is another elevator that's down an extremely long and dark hallway which is pretty much on the other side of the hotel. The welcome back dinners were good, but there wasn't much varity at breakfast (with it being a Hilton chain). We paid the extra amount and got a larger suite (which is the standard size in Florida). The first day the room was cleaned well and they sent up a playpen for the baby to sleep in. But the air condition in the bedroom was so cold and just blasted out the air, it was too cold for the baby. On our third last day we got a knock at our door in the morning.....an employee asked if I could check my washroom cause the room beside us was \"backed up\". Because it was pretty early no one had even used the washroom yet, most were still sleeping. So when I checked sure enough there was black stuff coming up out of our bathtub. He said that they would take care of everything while we were out that day. When we returned later that day from the beach, it was like we had walked into a murder scene (substituting red blood for black tar). It was ALL over the bathtub, the washroom walls and floor. When we went down the stairs to talk to front desk they asked if we could change rooms, saying that plumbers need to come back the next day to fix it. They gave us two rooms to check out, one being on the 5th floor which we remembered from previous reviews, was a smoking floor and was also a regular size suite. The minute I opened the door we didn't even have to walk in you could still smell the scent of cigarettes. The second room was on the 3rd floor and was a larger suite, but was right below the room were the problem originated.....we even questioned if it would be a problem. The front desk and an employee (that actually check out the room) assured us it wouldn't be.....So doubtfully we went with the 3rd floor suite only because we can't handle the smell of cigarettes (personal and because we were travelling with kids). Well after moving everything over we decided to give the kids a bath. While bathing them, drips of water were falling into the bathtub...we looked up to find the ceiling leaking. Again back down the stairs, (phone in this room didn't work as well) and they gave us a key to another suite just so we could shower. The next day we went about our day and were told the leak would be looked at while we were gone....We returned and the whole bathroom was a mess, there now was a hole cut out above the shower and above the toilet. And this time they didn't not care that we had items in the washroom and they didn't move them. Back down to the desk (via stairs) I told them I would just shower in the other room they gave us and they responded with oh no that room is no longer available...??? Fine but they didn't inform us that our \"showering room\" was no longer ours to use. So they again asked us to move. This time because they were no more larger suites available they were going to offer us two rooms. We didn't take two rooms, I didn't want the kids running back and forth in the hallway. It was nice of them to offer, but by this point we just wanted to quickly move our stuff over and not have to again. Doesn't sound like a lot to move rooms, but when you have now stayed for almost a week, there were things in the drawers, closets, fridge, freezer and cupboards. Not to mention 3 young children and a slow elevator. This was all obviously very unfortunately and something no one was expecting, but because the hotel was under staffed things weren't quickly looked at. There were also little things that weren't too appealing, like garbage bags at the end of the hallways filled and left there, our room was really only cleaned well the first day, the phones not working, and charging for the shuttle bus to Disney as well as parking in the hotel parking lot. I've stayed at quite a few Hilton hotels for personal and business and wouldn't recommend this one, it unfortunately left a bad last impression. I really hope things change for this hotel cause it could be a great hotel.", "title": "Could be a great hotel.....but", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RDFL", "date": "September 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 178929081}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites before yesterday, but was pleasantly surprised at all the perks a person receives at the hotel.
