My husband and I spent 2 weeks at the hotel in July and we liked it very much. As everyone says it is a lovely old buildings and the pool is absolutely fantastic, the gardens are lovely and there are different places to sit around the grounds The staff are very nice and friendly and helpful and as a family run place they are all there to please. We had a junior suite and the room was great lots of room and a large bathroom, good shower. The hotel is a major wedding venue but having said that it never interfered with our holiday it was lovely seeing the weddings set up around the pool in the evening and the rooms are a little way away so we never heard any noise either. The place is quite quirky and the summer dining room is in a sort of tended courtyard. The breakfast was good and dinner was nice but as we went a la cart we did find the menu did have not have enough variety. I understand that if we had gone half board we may have seen a change / special. We appreciate the menu is restricted to ensure that the food is good quality and fresh but a daily special would have been a bonus. Having read a couple of the more recent reviews I can assure you there are other restaurants nea by and you do not need to go into Taromina . There are 2 areas in Giardini Naxox one strip along the beach area but a nicer quieter strip sort of hidden behind the main bus stop ( ask for the Hilton hotel) . I think people just did not find them \u2013 and that is possibly one of my few criticisms of the hotel, as they are keen to encourage you to use their dining room they do not help by pointing out where else to go. There is a fantastic restaurant ( great value for money ) in a castle on top of the hill in the nearest village, and a great sea food place in Giardini also some good pizza places so you could mix and match high dining at the hotel with a slightly less expensive dinner another night. Taromina is lovely but to have to trip in there in the evening does seem like a bit too much trouble.", "title": "A lovely hotel and wonderful pool", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "RewelPeople", "date": "September 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117930762}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The grounds of the hotel were immaculate and so was the beach.

This really is a lovely place to stay. The grounds are very well kept and it's just a lovely place to walk around. The garden is well maintained with water features, lots of fruit trees and rabbits! The pool area is spotlessly clean and surrounded by trees. There is a private beach area - however, although this part of the beach is for use by hotel guests there is a charge of 18 Euros each person for the day for use of the beds and parasol - so be aware as this could easily add up a charge to your bill. The jacuzzi was broken when we were there so I cannot comment on it rather than say it would have been nice to use. There are a few points that let this hotel down, and that's the reason it doesn't get 5 stars. First of all there are carpets in our rooms. These carpets are dirty. They are full off visable bits of dirt. These carpets were never vacuumed for our entire stay. They were do grubby that we put them under our bed rather than walking on them. Next is the maid that cleans the room. Sometimes we would have your plastic cups replaced, sometimes we didn't. Very often the empty plastic cup that was used the day before and accidently left at the side of the bed was never emptied or thrown away by the maid. The bed linen although clean isn't the best quality (sorry - but I expect better linen for \u00a31700 for a weeks package holiday!) and were scratchy. The pillows are hard and uncomfortable. The towels are also a bit thin and greying. There are also a few mosquitos in the rooms. Plug-ins with repelant are provided but they're not very effective, so bring your own and make sure you have plenty of repelant on your body when walking around the grounds at night as you will get eaten alive! We ate once in the hotel. The food was lovely, but the experience wasn't. We were never asked if we wanted sweet or coffee. Perhaps it's because there was a rich couple in the restaurant at the same time as us demanding all the attention? Who knows, but we were let down by the service at dinner and felt ignored. We had our breakfast outside every day in a marquee and it was lovely. A good choice of food but only hot bacon and scrambled egg, nothing else, so if you like a hot breakfast (ie, the full monty) you're not going to get one! And although the food is good, it is somewhat over-priced, we paid 19 Euro's for a first course of pasta! Another thing worth noting is the weddings. There are weddings every night and they make a lot of noise! There are shutters on your windows so use them! We also couldn't use the pool area to sit one evening as there was a wedding next to the pool! It's also worth noting that this hotel is remote. There is virtually nothing within walking distance other than the beach. The nearest town that is safe to walk around is Gardini naxos and you will need a car to get there. Taormina is further still but you can get there in 20 mins using the autostrada. This is a lovely place to stay, but just be prepared for it being remote so not ideal if you don't have transport. And hopefully they will have cleaned the rugs by the time you get there!", "title": "A Castello that could do a little better.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "andare", "date": "September 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 139913793}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We have just had the most fabulous holiday in Sicily staying with friends for 4 nights in their Villa near Siracusa and then we descended on the Castello .", "title": "Fabulous and first class hotel.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Quaffs", "date": "September 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139043278}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "We were booked four days end of the high season and had paid the going rate which is probably a bit more than most hotels in the region but worth every penny .", "title": "The 'Fawlty Towers' of Sicily....", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "NightOwl1968", "date": "August 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 136719903}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were met by Simone a very nice smiley man who took us and helped with our bags to our very nice room a small distance from the hotel which was kind ,Simone also speaks good English and is extremely helpful.", "title": "Charming castle retreat", "user": "parma022", "date": "July 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 135702901}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The rooms surround the Castello ,some are in the beautiful very well kept gardens and some are attached to the Castello ,we were slightly further away in room 136 which is in a row of attached villas surrounded by lovely flowers gardens and trees.The paths around the beautiful Castello are all well lit so late at night it is a 2 minute walk from the Castello ,you will notice how spotlessly clean and well presented the paths ,gardens and all the amenities are.
