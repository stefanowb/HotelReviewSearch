The rooms are excellent, the beds comfortable and have hot showers, not much else needed in my eyes. It is great value for money as the breakfast was also included price. Staff are all excellent and very friendly.We ate there every evening and the food was excellent and as someone else has mentioned the minted peas with the fish and chips is excellent. But the best meal for me was the slow cooked lamb, excellent. The seating area outside has views that you can never get bored of also.All in all a brilliant little place and will definately re visit sometime in the future.

Having been given menus at the bar, we were then told that actually it was only the food on the blackboard which was available to order. This food was much more expensive than that in the menu that you are given when you go in, and a lot more fancy than most walkers, and certainly children would be looking for after a day out on Skye. Asked for a pork steak without the peppercorn sauce, which eventually came out with the sauce on. Asked the waiter to change it and was told \"you are lucky as we are just cooking another one for another customer\" Presumably the other customer was given the port steak removed from us!! I'm not sure why a lot of pubs are now going for such poncy food. This is fine for one day on hour holiday, but mostly you want good old fashioned pub grub from an Inn with a bunkhouse, Who on earth wants to pay more for their dinner than their bunk room?
