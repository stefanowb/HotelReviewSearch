Staff were friendly and welcoming at check in. Unfortunately, as I was about to get a bath I walked bare foot towards the bathroom and stood on an un noticed piece of glass on the carpet which cut my foot. My husband went down to reception with the piece of glass and to get some plasters for my now bleeding foot, staff on reception gave him some plasters and said they were the only staff on in the hotel and no house keeping on duty to come and hoover the room, but one of the reception staff said he would come and hoover the room in case there was anymore glass. Also the bath had hair around the edges which I cleaned before getting in, which reception staff also saw when he came to hoover the room. staff were apologetic. In the morning, we took our car to the long stay car park and waited for the shuttle bus where lots of other people had gathered at the bus stop to wait. When the bus came, everyone crammed into the bus and the racks for the suitcases were full and the bus driver was shouting not to have any suitcases in the aisles but there was no room and people were squashed stood up, I couldn't wait to get off ! I was dreading the return journey to pick the car up but the return journey was much better with plenty of room on the bus. Staff at the hotel wanted to give us a refund for the room after the glass incident, but the bank card we used to book the hotel had been blocked by the bank due to fraud and we were waiting new bank cards to arrive. We sent an email to premier inn customer relations and are still waiting a reply and a refund.", "title": "Ok stay - shame about Premier Inn's poor communication", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "laura W", "date": "August 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 172079412}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed here before a holiday.", "title": "Stansted premier inn", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "1985Jac", "date": "August 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 172059958}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel is as a normal premier inn.

Returned the rented car and took a taxi to the hotel. The taxi goes at a fixed rate of 8 pounds one-way, the bus would be 6 pounds for two people. So it's worth considering taking a taxi. The bus, which leaves every 30 minutes from and to the terminal, actually only needs 5-10 minutes, so it's an okay option. It's impossible to walk, it's too far and nowhere good to walk. There are two receptionists at all times, they are efficient and friendly. We were surprised to have everything you could actually ask for in any hotel, air conditioning, nice TV, tea making facilities, hair dryer, enough towels, decent shower. We were a bit unfortunate to have a stain on our cover duvet (blood or other?) which clearly showed even after the laundry. It took me one telephone call and to personal trips to the reception to get a new one. They always said \"give us 10 minutes\", but if you get that three times in a row at 11 o'clock at night, you get rather tired and annoyed. They tried to help and were apologetic, but it took too long.
