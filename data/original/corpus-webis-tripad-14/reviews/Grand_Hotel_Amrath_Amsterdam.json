Check in was painfully slow. We checked in on a Sunday evening and the hotel was empty. There were two employees working on checking in another guest so we waited about ten minutes before we could even get our check-in started. The woman who helped us routinely needed help from other employees to complete our check in. With the slow check in behind us we were shown to our rooms. The rooms were great. The beds were so comfortable with high quality sheets, pillows and comforters. There is a complimentary mini bar and complimentary wifi internet service...both pluses even though the wifi was also painfully slow at times. The room contained a big flat screen tv as well although there was no pay per view movie service. The bathroom door was a frosted glass door that provided little privacy and also illuminated the room at night when one used it i.e. everytime one got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom the other person woke up because of the light. The room was very clean though with great water pressure. The Amrath had a nice lobby bar. We had nightly drinks in the bar and always had good service with great drink options. We ate in the bar one night and the food was good for pub fare. We also had room service one night and it was good as well. I was awoken every day like clock work at 6:11am by some sort of banging that sounded like it was coming from above. Said noise lasted only a few minutes and then stopped, but the damage was done and it left a bad taset in my mouth. I'm on vacation and must sleep in! The elevators were real slow as well and there were only two that I saw. The location of the Amrath seemed slightly off the beaten path. While it was close to the Red light district, everything else of interest seemed kind of far away (museum square, flower market, city center). Now mind you that the city is not that big so I might be nitpicking about the location issue. I would stay at the hotel again because of the clean, nice, modern rooms. However, I might try and find something with a different location before booking next time.
