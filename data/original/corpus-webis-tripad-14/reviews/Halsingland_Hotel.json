The historical buildings which now make the Halsingland hotel are clean, warm, and comfortable. If you like the charm of old buildings and high ceilings, the Halsingland is your hotel. This hotel is a pleasant break from many motels in Haines. Individual rooms do not have their own microwave oven or small refrigerator but the manager, Jeff, was gracious to place a microwave oven in the common area and allowed the use of refrigerator in the bar area. One day during my stay, Jeff's wife made a cake for guests and later that day Jeff served home made chocolate chip cookies!! All in all, I will recommend this hotel as the best in the town of Haines.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 29, 2005", "id": 4070983}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely Hotel", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights.We had a very spacies and", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 26, 2005", "id": 3940432}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "You'll be pleased", "text": "clean room.

The public areas aren't too bad, but our room can only be described as shabby. It had cracked and worn paint on the walls and woodwork, beat-up motel-style furniture, cheesy polyester bedspreads, curtains that wouldn't close completely (no shades or blinds), a tiny bath with a broken soap dish and missing towel rack, inadequate lighting, and a musty smell. Worst of all, the housekeeping was lackadaisical. One day we had no hand towels, the next no bath mat, and the third day our room wasn't done at all! The maid had already left for the day, so the front desk clerk gave us clean towels and made a pass at the bed, but the apology we got from management was distinctly half-hearted. It's a shame because, spruced up, furnished in period style, and managed more attentively, this could be a truly charming place to stay.", "title": "Great restaurant, shabby room", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WHTraveler", "date": "July 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 18182220, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 restaurant", "disliked": "\u2014 room"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were also unpleasantly surprised that they don't serve breakfast, not even a continental buffet.

It is a rambling old fashioned hotel, but not that kind of place. It has undergone many renovations through the years and this process continues with the new owners. That being said, it is a true hotel with all the basic hotel amenities and some not so basic, such as Bath and Body Works products that were replinished daily. Our first floor room was very large and had an outside deck which suited us well since we are smokers. It was really three rooms including a large bathroom. The room was very clean and comfortable. Rooms run the gamut in size and amenities. Some upstairs rooms share a common bath and are inexpensive. The rooms on the front have a view across the parade grounds at Ft. Seward all the way down to ocean to snow covered mountains beyond. The same views can be had everyone who walks out the front door, and most of the larger first floor rooms that were original to house and don't have this view, but do feature the original fireplaces. The owner, Jeff Butcher and his staff, were very helpful and friendly. They seem to work day and night, never intrusive but always available. Haines seemed more like the real Alaska than most southeastern towns. A drive up the Haines Highway and a drink at the Pioneer Bar or the Fogcutter will convince you. The only gas station in town that has a real person operating it will pump your gas give you free coffee and popcorn. In evenings or mornings in the early fall, drive out to the Chilkoot River to see the Alaska Brown bears feeding on salmon as they run. Wild Strawberry offers an awesome food, but I would not miss dinner at the Hasingland Hotel. The food in restaurant could only be described as wonderful.
