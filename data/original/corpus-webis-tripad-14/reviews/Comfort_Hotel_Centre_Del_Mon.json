We arrived by train so ideal as right there and about a 15 to 20 minute walk into the centre. It is a bit awkward to get back to the hotel later at night after the shopping centre has closed as the main entrance is on the far side of the station from the town so an extra walk around. There seems to be more work going on so perhaps this will be rectified in time. If you need supplies there is a well stocked supermarket in the shopping centre and a Subway etc. Having stayed in Perpignan previously on a couple of occasions this hotel was easily the best experience. The staff were friendly and didn't have any language problems with us, the rooms were quiet and comfortable and we all slept very well in our rooms on the 4th floor. Would definitely stay here again as the quality and freshness of the hotel more than makes up for not being in the town centre plus its great for onward travel.
