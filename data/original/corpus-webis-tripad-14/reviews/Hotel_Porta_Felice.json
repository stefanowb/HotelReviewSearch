We didn't use the spa, but the small roof terrace was nice for relaxing, breakfast was average. There was free wi-fi, but we could only get it on the roof terrace, not in the room. The bed mattress was the hardest we have ever experienced, very uncomfortable! No tea/coffee making facilities in the room, and none available after midnight anywhere in the hotel.

We were deeply disappointed. Upon our arrival, we were informed that we had to stay our first night at a nearby hotel due to an unexpected incident which made rooms on the 2nd floor not available. Subsequently we found out that we were bumped out in order to accommodate a large tour group. The reception person expressed hotel's desire to compensate for our inconvenience, but declined to offer us the complimentary massage we requested. We expressed displeasure, but the manager never responded to our complaints during the time we stayed at the hotel. The room is large with functional AC and a comfy bed. The bathroom has good shower with plenty of hot water. However, the hotel facility is not up to the standards of a 4 star. During the 3 nights we stayed, one elevator was under repair and the other was malfunctioning. Fortunately we were able to get out of the elevator unharmed. Breakfast was poor, with very limited and basic selection of choices and served in a rather shabby and cramped space. Very slow wifi.

They offer street parking, but, we opted to pay for parking. Room was spacious and modern, with WiFi, though, this worked better in the restaurant. It took some getting used to their security and energy saving system, but, only a small annoyance. Breakfast was standard fare and dinner was very good. Room views from the back of the hotel are non-existent. Noise from cats and birds forced us to keep the windows closed and run the A/C; even then, they can wake you at night. Staff was very helpful and, in particular, Alessandra, who tried to help us locate the birth certificate for my wife's grandfather (born near Palermo). She seemed to take it as a personal challenge, but, unfortunately, we hit a wall without an actual day and month. We were also impressed at her ability to continue helping others, while waiting for assistance on the phone to the Office of Records.
