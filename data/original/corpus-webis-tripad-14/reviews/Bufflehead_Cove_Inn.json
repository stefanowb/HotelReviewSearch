It is set on several acres of lovely and peaceful riverfront property, an easy mile or so from the heart of Kennebunkport, . Each of the rooms is unique, with either River or Garden views. Our very large room had a garden view with private flower-filled patio. Personal touches are everywhere-- like a huge library of books and magazines, fresh cut flowers and turndown service with chocolates every night. The Innkeepers, Harriet, Jim, and Erin Gott , do everything conceivable to make this feel like Home, only better. Breakfast is graciously served on a lovely, spacious patio overlooking the River. You are asked what you would like to have so it is \"customized\" to one's individual taste. I even had hot Oatmeal in August!! There is always someone on site so if you lose your key, for example, as my husband and I did around midnight, it is no problem. And wine and cheese are served nightly in the lovely living room of the house so that everyone can get to know one another better. And we took full advantage, getting to know the owners and one other couple-- an added plus, lots of good travel tips. All in all, everything was PERFECT and we can't wait to return!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "CHANCY2", "date": "August 21, 2006", "id": 5663103}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Check their website: [--------------]to see photos as well", "title": "Disappointed", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Crawley", "date": "August 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 5577748, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 River view", "disliked": "\u2014 Breakfast"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006", "text": "As part of a 3 week holiday in New England, we stayed at Bufflehead Cove for 2 nights in July having booked this B&B based on previous good reviews that we had read on this site and from their own website information.
