The brochure featured our 4 night stay would be at La Truffiere in Gignac, or similar. A couple of days before our departure we received the itinary which indicated our hotel would be the Ibis in Brive. La truffiere boasted a swimming pool, Wifi in room, Lounge bar, Restauant all in a rural setting. The Ibis had a bar to seat 9, no lounge, no restaurant, Wifi in the bar area, no pool, all in a town centre setting. Our evening meals had to be taken in a restaurant a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Due to lack of facilities we had no opportunity to gather together for meetings and socialise as a group. The tour manager had been drafted in at late notice and had no first hand knowledge of the places we were to visit. We were marched to the local tourist info centre and given a map of the locations, then left to fend for ourselves and try to find the points of interest, which had been researched on the internet the night before and repeated to us by the travel manager on the coach. Travelsphere were sorry for our dissapointment but said, they only undertake to provide a similar standard of accomodation??? The only similarity was it was in France and had the same star rating!!
