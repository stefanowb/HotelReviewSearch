We were greeted with smiles and conversation at the front desk. The hotel has beautiful decor, grounds and atmosphere. Service was outstanding from the free cookies, free shuttle service within a 2 mile radius, helpful suggestions for resaturants and shopping, and responsiveness to our needs as customers. I have traveled to many places and this hotel made my top 5 for their excellent service. Our toilet kept running one night and they had it fixed quickly along with a voucher for another free cookie. Breakfast was exceptional with healthy options and made to order omlets. Wi-Fi is available and free along with comfy beds.

We were travelling with our pet cockerpoo and needed a pet friendly hotel. Checking in late on a Saturday, we were assigned to a room with 2 queens on the 3rd floor, not the king room requested, where we registered to stay for 6 nights. We also had requested a connecting room starting the 4th night for our son and his toddler, and were told that that would be available on his arrival. On my son's arrival, we were told that because we had a dog, we could not be given a connecting room, except two handicapped rooms on the first floor, which when checked, not only smelled badly (not of dog or cat), but were noisy, etc. The carpeting in this facility is old and stained and badly in need of replacement. Our beds were made, but housekeeping was poor (lamp table and desk had food residue left unwiped) shower leaked all over floor (curtain would not close completely.) While staff was courteous, they just didnt seem interested in helping us, but simply yess, I apologize for thatted us to death. We eventually arranged for housing for our dog with a friend for the final 3 days of our stay and moved to a new Hilton Garden Inn opposite the Gardens Mall, which was one of the best Hilton Poperties I have stayed in. I recommend that anyone give up the cookies at the Doubletree and move to the Hilton Garden Inn instead. Close to the Gardens Mall and the Downtown Center, its within walking distance to both.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "debtlaw", "date": "January 12, 2011", "id": 92699735}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011", "text": "I was looking forward to my stay, I only wish they felt the same. My room didn't have a coffee maker, alarm clock, or TV remote. I called the front desk and they had everything sent up within 30 minutes. It was unnerving; what happened to the room before our arrival? The hotel is right off the highway and it is very loud in the room. There were only two full size towels in the bath. I am used to having 4 at other hotels.
