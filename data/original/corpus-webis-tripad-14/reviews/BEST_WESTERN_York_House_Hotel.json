Most of the hotels in Eastbourne do a four day xmas special which is great but not what we wanted as we were visiting family for two days. The York House could take a booking for two nights B&B which suited us. The public areas of the hotel are fine and relaxing and the bar is busy and lively. The rooms do need a bit of investment but remember this is a 3 star hotel so we didnt expect much. The beds are very small doubles and very uncomfortable, the rooms are basic but you get what you pay for. The highlight of the stay were the very helpful and friendly staff, they looked after us very well and changed our room to a sea view when we complained about the first one they put us in. Overall if I was visiting Eastbourne I would normally book into one of the four star hotels, but if you are doing this on a budget then the York House Hotel is a great option. We booked direct with Best Western but not sure what is the best way to book.", "title": "The only option over xmas but good all the same", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tieler", "date": "January 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122706670}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011", "text": "We had a lovely few days stay and function at this Hotel.", "title": "Happy Days", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lee M", "date": "January 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 122390153}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "All of our guest staying at the hotel were happy with their rooms and the service by the staff.", "title": "Just what we were looking for.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cptnairfix", "date": "December 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121945472}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The breakfast was very good and the meals at the hotel were of a high quality with a good wine list.", "title": "Great value", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Susan C", "date": "December 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121845553}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Booked three nights here as a base for some family visits.", "title": "Excellent Stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "stevebrass", "date": "June 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 131281144}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled on business", "text": "We were very impressed with the room - separate dressing area and wet room.", "title": "Business Trip", "user": "Amber56", "date": "May 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129447817}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The staff are excellent - helpful, courteous and attentive.", "title": "Short break in Eastbourne", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ches96", "date": "May 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 129309187}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012", "text": "The food we had - breakfast - was varied and plentiful, although the coffee was I am afraid to say fairly awful.", "title": "Cannot be faulted", "user": "Hollowg", "date": "April 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 129041549}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The swimming pool is a good amenity.", "title": "\"Lovely bank holiday weekend break\"", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Alan B", "date": "April 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127694102}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012", "text": "Stayed here with my husband for two nights.
