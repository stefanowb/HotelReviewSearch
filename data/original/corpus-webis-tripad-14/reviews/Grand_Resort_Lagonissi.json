The entire resort is self contained with several restaurants. While the map on the website makes the resort look huge, its actually not. A quick jog and you can do a full lap in about 5 minutes. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food was good, but the Asian onsite restaurant has sushi which wasn't particularly special considering you are on the sea. The bungalows are right on the water and offer plenty of space, but other rooms are available for less price further in on land. My room 196 was quiet, but one level above the beach. The room has its own steam room, which is quite unique. The sunset is beautiful. I was here for a business conference, which may interrupt some vacationers.", "title": "Paradise for Business Meetings", "user": "C_and_MH", "date": "October 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183070329}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We were in this hotel this weekend, it is the first time we are disappointed by a hotel referenced by Leading Hotel of the world.", "title": "NOT A LEADING HOTEL OF THE WORLD!!!!
