My room was on the second floor and everytime I walk in the hall way all I can small is the grease from the kitchen. The beds where extremely uncomfortable and there were small holes in the bed sheets. The service staff was unfriendly and sexist. I travel with a male partner and the room was registered under my name, yet the whole time my male partner was addressed to, while I have to catch the male receptionist attention and also was given an attitude. I will never recommend this place to anyone, it's not worth the value of your dollar.
