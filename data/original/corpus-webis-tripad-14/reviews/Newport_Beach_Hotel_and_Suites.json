Bought tickets for the festival and waited a few weeks to book a room and alas the inn we usually stay at was booked. We picked the Newport Beach hotel as our best alternative as we like to stay in the Middletown beach area. My first impression was the odor in the hotel lobby. Couldn't figure it out. The lobby is clean and modern but the odor confused me. Stayed in the historic hotel on the fourth floor..a corner room with a glimpse of the ocean...one queen bed. The room is small but with a nice flat panel TV, refridgerator, coffee maker, CD-DVR player. The size of the bathroom was generous. The room was clean, no odor like the lobby, and quiet...we were even next to the elevator. Had breakfast in the restaurant on the first floor all three days and the food and service was exceptional. The room was pricey and there was a surcharge of $38.00 to park for three nights. The parking fee pissed me off since I paid $1087.00 for 3 nights. Didn't go to the pool or fitness center because we were out at the festival all day. For the price..I wouldn't go back here.

Not sure what the delay was, but they ended up putting us in another 1 bedroom which was. This wasn't offered initially as an option until I mentioned the check in time as the room they gave us was still a standard 1 bedroom with a pond side view. The room itself was great, clean and as expected when looking at their website. The hotel is right across from First beach and a short walk. The beach itself is nice but the red seaweed can be a bit of a problem at certain spots on the beach. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and we will be looking to return for another visit.
