First off, the group I traveled with (my boyfriend and some friends) were expecting very little from this place. Between the (mostly) harsh reviews and the very low rate we got we were practically expecting holes in the walls. I am happy to report we were very pleasantly surprised! From the moment we walked into the hotel we were greeted with drinks and welcomed. The only problem was that our room was not yet ready and we were forced to walk around and wait for it to be ready. We had to put our luggage in a storage closet and we wanted to change out of our flight clothes, but it seemed like more trouble than it was worth to dig out shorts/a swimsuit to change in the public lobby bathroom. Things may have started poorly, but after an hour or so our rooms were ready and we entered our rooms. The villas were very cute and gave the hotel a home-y feel. Our room had just one king size bed, and though the mattress was very hard, like some reviews say, it did not bother us in the slightest. After all, we weren't there to sleep! Granted, we are young and without any back problems, but that was our take on the mattress situation. The room was immaculate aside from a few ants right near the window but it was not close to the bed at all so this was not too bothersome. It should be known that I can be quite picky about cleanliness, and this room lived entirely up to my standards.", "title": "Great Vacation", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "travel12326", "date": "August 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 74380993}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "WORST \"MOTEL\" - WORST VACATION EVER!", "text": "The beach and pool area were great.

Sometimes we were stuck with a late reservation but we had a party of 10 so that is to be expected. There was a great open air restaurant by the pool/beach, great for grabbing lunch without having to walk far. As far as drinks go, they were made fairly weak but if you slipped the bartender a dollar or two they seemed to throw a little extra alcohol in. On that note, don't bother converting money. US dollars were perfectly acceptable and even encouraged.

When our rooms were ready we were pleasantly surprised. We requested first floor and next to our friends who were with us. We had building 9 right on the beach facing the ocean. We also had adjoining rooms with the other couple which worked out great because we were sharing a nanny. The room was completely renovated to a modern flair. It was small but a ton of storage. We had 3 adults and a 1 year old in it and had plenty of room. We had 1 king size bed, 1 couch, 1 chair a desk, table, 2 night stands, a fantastic closet. We had inside a full size jogging stroller and a pack and play. We requested a crib and all they have is pack and plays but who cares I did not have to haul it. It was clean and safe. The only thing that was difficult was the marble tiled showers with a 1 year old. Bring either a blow up tub or a non slip mat. The beds are hard but we did not go on vacation to sleep all day. The room was clean and we had really no issues. The first 12 hours we were there the manager called to see if we needed anything. If we did we just called and we got it. The safe is fine it has a key lock and we had no issues. In fact the only thing we had in it was money and our passports.
