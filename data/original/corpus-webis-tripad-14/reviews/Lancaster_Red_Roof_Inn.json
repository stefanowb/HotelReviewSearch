We arrived an hour early and thought we'd take a chance at the desk, where we were greeted warmly and allowed to check in right away. We stayed in room 201, and it was spotlessly clean and bright, both in the sleeping and bathroom areas, and the amount of counter, desk top and dresser space is wonderful. Our TV worked just fine, and had a very clear picture. We couldn't hear any sound from the rooms around us. Also, we were pleasantly surprised to find that their parking lot accesses the restaurants and stores next door, so we were able to turn left onto busy Route 30 at a traffic light. The Red Roof is so convenient to the Rockvale Outlets, American Music Theatre and most other attractions (especially with that light!) We were told that there was breakfast available, but didn't bother checking it out - after all, this is Pennsylvania Dutch Country! A couple of days after our trip, we were horrified to realize we'd forgotten to leave a tip for the housekeeper, who had smiled and wished us a nice day as we left. I emailed the hotel to ask if I could mail a tip for her, since she'd obviously done a nice job with our room. All I got back was a reply thanking me for staying at their hotel, saying \"my comments would motivate their staff to work even harder!\" I was really impressed by that.

I found the bed to be very comfortable but the pillows were too firm for my liking. We also got free carparking and free wireless internet. We did hear a noise outside the room which may have been the air-conditioning but it did not disturb us at all.

The room was clean but the shower didn't look very clean. The sink outside the bathroom was long and fit all of my products while I got ready. Did not have the breakfast because it was over by 9..

The couch in the room was disgusting, there were white, possibly stucko, flakes all around the edges of the room and the paint job in the bathroom was rididculous.
