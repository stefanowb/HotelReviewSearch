Its not on the beach, but is on the waterfront where you can walk all the way into town with no problem, right on the bay. Ask for a water view. Rooms are large and renovated. (My only negative was that the bathroom floor was not thoroughly clean.) However, don't think twice about staying here as the service was very friendly, free wireless worked great and is literally 5 minutes from the airport. There is a small restaurant (with no windows) but adequate for breakfast. In the evening there is tasteful live local music in the atrium where the restaurant serves under umbrellas. If not in the summer, when its very hot, the atrium dining area is quite relaxing. If you want a convenient walk to a terrific restaurant, go to Frenchtown about 1/2 mile walk from the hotel where there is a wonderful Bella Blue restaurant, wonderful wines, very reasonable prices and great food. I would eat there every night. On your walk back you may catch a baseball/softball game with local teams right next door to the Holiday Inn. Watch the taxi rates - they will take advantage if given the opportunity. The local guidebooks show you what rates the taxis should charge.", "title": "Good value.

I called the manager to discuss. I wanted him to guarantee me four refurbed rooms. (The hotel is going through a major renovation). He would not. But when I got there I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was very nice and the people polite. My room on the 4h floor (room 443) was nice with a great ocean view. Very clean. Bathroom was nice. The other room on the 4th floor was very nice also. Note: Paid $250/room with tax for each room. The two rooms on the third floor were not as nice but okay. The bathrooms were old and outdated and depressing but the rest of the room was nice. The courtyard and pool area were very nice and it was obvious that they put a lot into it. Great place to sit and drink the duty free liquor you bought in town. Great bronze sculptures. The location was great with shopping nearby. Directly across the street on the waterfront a Texas BBQ vendor appeared at around 6 pm. I grabbed a take out order of ribs and brisket for $16 with enough for two people. I took it back to the hotel court yard to eat iwhile listening to steel drum music. Highly recommend doing this. Not sure why the hotel was totally fenced in like a prison but I guess it is not a safe neighborhood at night.. There is a Catholic church directly behind hotel. Mass was more like a Baptist revival with interesting loud joyful music (but it was Catholic).. Overall, they seem to really be tryng hard to upgrade this hotel. I would stay again if they would guaratee me a oceanview room on the 4th floor. They were in th process of renovating the other rooms but I would be wary until finished. Be careful with the quoted rates. They add a service charge and room tax that adds considerably to the cost. For example, a $199 room becomes $250 when you add all the taxes and charges. I am sitting here back in Michigan in the snow. But wish I was back in my 4th floor hotel room watching the cruise ships go in and out of the harbor.

We upgraded to a water side view for an extra $30 a night which made all the difference in us having a great time versus an ok time. I've read rooms not facing the water have pretty bad views and are prone to the sounds of roosters in the early morning. With the water view we heard no roosters and always had a pleasant scenery to look out on. The staff was friendly for the most part, a couple of staff members in particular didn't seem too thrilled to be working and didn't seem too fond of tourist in general. After I was done with them they began speaking another language with pissy looks on their faces. Can't be sure they were speaking about me but I always get an uncomfortable feelings when these kind of moments arise. Other then that everything was just fine and my girlfriend and I almost preferred to stay at the holiday inn rather a resort since you can pretty much go into the resorts on the island and use the beaches and eat at their restaurants for a fraction of the cost of actually staying at the resort. If you plan on going to St. Thomas and exploring all of the island I recommend renting a Jeep rather then taking taxis.

As a matter of fact, Hertz had no cars available for anyone. It seems car reservations on the Virgin Islands are frequently disregarded. We were put on a waiting list and we were told that we would be contacted when a vehicle was available. We did NOT have reservations for a hotel that evening. It was beginning to seem like we were not going to find a room for the night until we called the Holiday Inn. They had one available for $200 plus $40 tax. The people whom I spoke with at the reservation office were courteous. The employees at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The room had all the amenities you might expect including a mini-fridge and a hair dryer. It was relatively clean and well maintained except for some permanent damage to a few tiles at the entry-way of the room. The common areas were beautiful. The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant and a small casino with slot machines. The bartender provided us with good service. The exercise room was a bonus. The spiral staircase in the main foyer adds to the hotels unique design and the pool seemed well taken care of although the chlorine level seemed a bit off (the water tasted strange). Our view was \u201cinteresting\u201d. It looked over the rundown local homes and businesses located in the area. The neighborhood did seem safe, and it was a short walk (1/2 mile) to downtown Charlotte Amalie where the cruise ships dock and the tourist market is.
