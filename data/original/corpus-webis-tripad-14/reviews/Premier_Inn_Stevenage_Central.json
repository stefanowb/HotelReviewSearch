I did book a long time ago and got good rates (total \u00a387). Staff were very efficient, friendly and went that 'extra mile' which was brilliant, considering we didn't check in until around 10pm and were ratty and exhausted! The room was SO comfortable, spotless and the bed fantastic! Good to have branded soap and shower gel too. The room walls were well insulated too (as rather a lot of the guests staying were rowdy, even though there are signs up asking to have consideration!) Breakfast next day was good - the unlimited choice (\u00a37.99) was amazing - branded again (eg: costa coffee), cooked food was hot and fresh, service good. For the price, this stay was exceptional! I don't know if all Premier Inns are as good as this, but we are looking to book again here for next year!
