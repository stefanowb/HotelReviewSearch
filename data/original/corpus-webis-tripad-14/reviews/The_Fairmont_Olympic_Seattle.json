We were a couple of doors down from the elevator, but it was quiet. The room included a kettle and Keurig machine with quality coffee and teas, along with a well-stocked mini bar. However, there were a couple of items in the mini bar that were beyond their expiration date.

The receptionist must have felt sorry for me, because even though I was booked in a regular conference-rate room, she gave me THE best suite in the hotel! It was truly amazing. I just returned from another 4-night stay, this time with a roommate and a request for a room with 2 beds. We were upgraded to a very spacious deluxe room and had a large dressing room with two large closets. Beds were very comfortable and the room was spotless. The only problems we encountered were a TV that didn't always get an HD signal, and some problems with splitting our bill between two cards, which were remedied quickly. The location was wonderful, between the conference center and the Market. The Light Rail station is only a block away.

Just like other Fairmont's, this hotel doesn't disappoint. We stayed in suite 1026 and it is up to Fairmont expectations. The architecture of the building is very beautiful. Our bed was a little hard for me, I prefer a softer bed. A couple of things that I found strange were that there was no air conditioning and at night it could get very hot, but you can open the windows. The air registers are on the window sills, and at night when you close the curtains it blocked off the air flow, thus getting hot at night. Another thing I was very surprised by was the amount of siren noise. We were here for 4 nights and 3 days and the sirens from fire trucks, ambulances and police never seemed to stop.
