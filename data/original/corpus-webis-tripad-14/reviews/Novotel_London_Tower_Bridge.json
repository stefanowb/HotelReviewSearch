It was extremely unreliable and I would highly recommend NOT using the car company the hotel associates with. Ask for them to arrange a London Black cab instead. The hotel claims the service they use is cheaper, but I don't believe that it actually is. The hotel did say that they have never had problems with this company, but I had the hotel book a car for us 3 times during our stay. Only once did the car service work out. The other two times we almost missed our Stonehenge tour and then almost missed our flight out of Heathrow. The car never showed up to take us to Heathrow even though I confirmed the night before that it would be there for us. After waiting and asking numerous times where the car was the hotel ended up calling (after my insisting on it) a London Black cab for us which showed 10 minutes later and got us to the airport in record time.", "title": "Awesome Location!

From check-in, to the restaurant managers responsible for the breakfast sittings, from the super speedy room service (surprisingly good menu) to the cleaning staff - it's seamless. On top of that, you are a stone's throw from the Tower of London, but it's in an almost whisper quiet location(being in the City, the weekends are dead when you are away from the touristy bit of the Tower), and there are plenty of budget-friendly local bars and eateries such as Subway, Pizza Express, All Bar One and Wagamama close by.
