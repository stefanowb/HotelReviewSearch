Comfort Suites is not as trendy as the Fairfield Inn, but is elegant looking when you walk in. They gave us an even better rate than their standard and military rate since my husband is here working in the area (and I am told that they have a \"your rates are too high rate.\") In my opinion their regular rate is a value to begin with.
