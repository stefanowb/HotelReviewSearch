While this hotel was very pretty and reasonably priced if sharing with three people, I cannot say it was my favorite hotel I've ever stayed in. The location was so-so.... it was a good 10-20 minute walk from anything to do (there are some small shops and bakeries 10 minutes away, and old town is about a 20 minute walk). The elevator and hallways were impossibly small for luggage unless you had just a carry-on bag. Wi-fi was only available in the lobby but you had to get a password from the front desk that expired every 15 minutes, which was completely unreasonable if you ask me. One of our two nights, the bartender and another person who worked at the hotel got into a fist-fight. While I recognize that it is Europe and rooms are small, this room seemed VERY small and the beds were VERY uncomfortable compared to other places I've stayed in Europe. Overall, I think while it was clean and pretty and the bar was nice (save the fighting staff), one could probably find better options for the same price. I do highly recommend Salzburg, though.
