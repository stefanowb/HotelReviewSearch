It scored high on so many things - friendly staff (everyone!), comfy beds, very posh bedding and towels, extra towels and pillows, nice toiletries, lots of restaurants, convenient to walk to just about everywhere, loads of plusses! Our king room was big enough - fit a desk and chair and comfy chair without a problem. And we didn't need to move anything to walk around the bed. Unfortunately, they got dragged down by cleanliness. We had to ask for our room to be vacuumed ... from the previous tenant. And I'm sure it was not vacuumed daily. It really was close to perfect, but lack of good cleaning staff/policies really drags it down. I am clinging to the idea that these are teething pains, because I loved so much about it. We would probably stay again, because the front desk staff really helped get things cleaned up.

He set me up with a nice king size bed - in a quiet corner room. The bathroom was clean (stocked with bath and body products - one of my favorite brands), bed was extremely plush and comfortable, temperature was perfect (didn't need to adjust at all) and a 32 inch flat panel HD TV kept me entertained. I slept like a baby and checkout went smoothly in the morning. Before leaving, I had asked his staff for suggestions on great eats around the area (supplied me with quite a few options).

We were given a clean room on the 6th floor on the back with the view of an airshaft. Free Wi-Fi was nice, but a little slow. The room was pretty small, but NYC generally has small rooms. We had a wardrobe for hanging clothes with an iron, ironing board inside and small coffee maker/set. One of the problems we had was a lack of any places to set anything down in the room (other than the floor). In the entire room, we only had one small nightstand. As a result, you have to try and sqeeze your wallet, keys, guidebook, map, subway card, drink, watch, remote control, clock, etc. on that one nightstand. I am not sure where you are supposed to actually MAKE the coffee. We tried making ours on the top of the toilet tank and on the floor. No closet. No desk or safe in the room although they are listed as amenities on the website. They did deliver a safe to go in our wardrobe when we requested it. I had to go to the front desk to get more shampoo and conditioner because they didn't give us anymore when they cleaned the room. The bed was the highpoint of the room itself.
