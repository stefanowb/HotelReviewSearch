As a very frequent traveler, I am what some might call....picky. And I was a little nervous after reading the reviews on tripadvisor - the unanimously glowing reviews seemed too good to be true. But I am pleased to add my glowing review to the mix - Hotel Hydra was just perfect. Katerina was so kind and hospitable, making me feel exceptionally welcome. Room 202 was wonderful - spotless, bright, tastefully appointed, comfortable bed and seating, great water pressure...and the view. that balcony is special. Breakfast was delicious and beautifully arranged. The stairs are no joke and in hindsight i should have had a donkey take my roller bag up to the hotel upon arrival, but the climb did not bother me for the rest of my time there. I walked up to the hotel 2-3 times a day and it wasn't terrible. And absolutely worth it for such a gem of a hotel (and the view!).

Sure, you have to climb steps, almost 150 steps to be precise! But this is Hydra. Either you never want to climb any steps and you sleep directly in the port , near the donkeys and the mass of tourists, or you walk up stairs! We did just that. The first day, it seemed a lot, but after 48 hrs we got accustomed to climbing back and forth 3-4 times a day just like the locals do! The decor is splendid. The beautiful soft colours of the wall and of the furniture but first you have to stop by the reception to meet the gem that directs this hotel Katerina Nikolaidou. Always smiling, always at your very needs. She offers breakfast served anywhere in the hotel (room, terrace and probably as you chat wit her at her desk)! at any time of the day. And we did have our breakfast till 1pm! Fresh and still hot pastries, fresh fruits and anything else that you care for and that she can offer you from her small cuisine. We stayed in a larger room for 3 days, facing the port of Hydra. Very large living room . Very nice bedroom. Bathroom large enough for an hotel like this. A/C and a small kitchenette. We were then moved to a slightly smaller room with a balcony...the room with a balcony that most people wanted! Smaller living room, same size bed room but larger bathroom with bath/shower sliding doors closing completely. We had a partially closing bath/shower in the first room, and too much water got on the floor, but a very minor problem.", "title": "Excellence in every aspects.
