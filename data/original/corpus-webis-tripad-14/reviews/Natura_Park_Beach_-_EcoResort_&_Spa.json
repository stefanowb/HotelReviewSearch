I hate to be the bearer of bad news but not only is NATURA PARK not the model environmentally aware corporate citizen, but its services are absolutely horrendous. First off, the reusable beach cups are gone; second off, bleach-free laundy was a marketing stunt and no longer applies as well. Thirdly, the service was bad. This especially holds true for front desk personnel who had the audacity to insult some members of my travelling party. Finally, a word of advice to those booking NATURA independantly outside a tour group ... DONT! We had confirmed pre-paid booking for 8 persons for 3 nights and they were given to tour groups and airline personnel with big contracts. As an independant traveller, I would avoid Natura Park because you never know if your reservation would be there.

My husband and I went with my sister and her husband. We have stayed at several all inclusives and this one ranked right up there with the others. The grounds are beautiful and the ground keepers work very hard to maintain it. One was cutting down some fruit from a tree, I am assuming so it would not fall on someone walking by and offered it to me. The flamingos are beautiful and it was fun to see the geese laying on their eggs. The peacock was fun especially when it came right up to our table at the main buffet. The rooms were pretty good. It does have a \"natural\" feel. It would have been nice to have a more private bathroom door. The maids were good and even came back and re-mopped our floor after the maintance men had to fix a leaking toilet. They put flowers on the bed each day. The pool was nice although we spent most of the time in the ocean. The swim up bar was fun. The bar above the swim up bar was a nice cool place to sit at night. Too bad the bartender, Francisco didn't work at night. He made the best banana mamas. The beach was great. We didn't have trouble finding a hut to sit under but if you want one right close to the water, you should go down early and reserve one. There was some sea grass floating but it wasn't slimy so it didn't really bother us. Plus, you are in the ocean so things will be floating from time to time. I felt so sorry for the worker who had to sweep it each day, put it in a wheel barrel and wheel it down the beach to where he dumped it for a truck to pick it up. And we all complain about our jobs!!!!! We went snorkeling to the left of the beach when you are looking at the water. There is a tree fallen down and there are two good locations. The better of the two, which is farther out is not real safe as it is outside the protected swim area and you have to watch out for speed boats coming by. There is also an area right outside the rope in the swim area that was nice. Make sure you take bread with you and your underwater camera. We took rafts to float out in the ocean and I would highly recommend doing that. Talk about relaxing. We bought cheap ones and then left them there instead of deflating. There are shops down the beach, but we found them not to be real cheap as in someother countries we have been to. You can deal with them, but it takes persistence on your part. I don't know if it is the same day each week, but Thursday night, they were up by the main buffet. Now about the food. It was pretty good, nothing great though. We definitely did not go hungry though. There is the main buffet which is where we had breakfast. Then there is the steak house, which we ate at and it was good. We did not eat at the Italian. My sister and brother in law ate at the seafood one night and said it was good. We usually ate lunch at the buffet by the pool as you could just walk in with your suits on and it had a beautiful view of the ocean. We noticed that men without long pants were eating in the steakhouse and the main buffet at night although we were told that you were supposed to wear long pants. So we tried it one night and didn't have any problems. There isn't much night life but that was ok since we were there with another couple. Not many people spoke English as a first language but we didn't have any trouble in terms of a language barrier. Now for a couple negatives, it rained briefly one night right before we ate dinner at the steakhouse by the pond. Just as we were finishing our meals, the mosquitos decided it was time for them to eat. But the staff was right there with bug spray although we still encountered many bites. So bring bug spray and be proactive and spray it on before you eat. You have to call for the mini fridge to be unlocked after you arrive and they lock it the day before you leave. But they did come get out the \"free\" stuff when we called and asked them to open it back up. So we got the sodas and the beers for the night, but they weren't cold. It would be nice if the fridge was just stocked with the freebies and then you wouldn't have that hassel. Also the electricity went off a couple times, but for 5-10 minutes tops. I still wished I had brought a flashlight. Also, there are no clocks so you might want to bring one.

The nightly entertainment was slightly amateurish and is not something that would make us want to return. The staff was friendly and helpful but unorganized at times. At check-in we were not told we needed to put a down-payment of $20.00 US or no remote control OR that we needed to ask to have someone unlock our fridge which made our first two hours in our room frustrating with returns and calls to the front desk. A few items of clothing went missing from our room. Some calls to their laundry for the articles, which just happened to be nice lingerie, went unanswered. People walk-in from the beach and use the bars, beach buffet and the night club and main buffet. I think this resort could use identification bracelets. One person to avoid on the beach is a young man named ORLANDO who sells short day-trips to a restaurant called Lagoustine for $40.00 US pp. He'll tell you you are going to see the Natura Pools and then go to the restaurant for lunch and that you get two free gifts you choose from Lagoustines gift shop. What happens is that you get dropped off at the restaurant a mile up the beach and you are given 2 for $1.00 items . No choice of gifts, no swim at the Natura Pools. The restaurant itself is a good beach restaurant but they should get rid of the guy putting $20.00 US grass hats on patrons heads while they're eating and the guy snapping your picture and trying to sell you a bottle of cheap rum with your picture on it for $15.00 US while you eat your dessert. The meal and boat ride there (we were told there would be 6 people in our boat and 14 showed up) weren't worth $80.00 US a couple. It's a gaff. Natura Park should simply get rid of this guy.

As far as getting sick as I said this is my 5th time to the Carribean and havent been sick yet. Most of the reasons that people get ill here is by way of habit. Eating too much is a big one, how often does one have the opportunity to stuff themselves full of a wide variety of different food as many times a day as they want and drink their guts out at the same time, no wonder they get sick. Pace yourself your body is not used to many of these habits. Not washing there hands, using the tap water for brushing teeth. I always carry alcohol hand wash for after using the washrooms or after touching areas that many people are around etc.Use the bottled water for your teeth. Stay away from mayo based salad dressings and cold meats. Keep an open mind and just enjoy the weather after all you are in a country where the sun will bake you inside of a half hour.Use sun screen often. I reccomend spf 30+ if you have fair skin. Drink lots of water. Ask for extra in you room.Drink the two they give you regardless of how much else you drink, every day.
