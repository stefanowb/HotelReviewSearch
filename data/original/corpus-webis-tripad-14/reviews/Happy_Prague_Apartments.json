We parked our car the evening we arrived and didn't need it again until the day we departed. The apartment was nicely decorated, the kitchen well equipped, and the bed/linen super comfortable. Did I mention the heated bathroom floors...sheer heaven as the temperature dipped in the evenings :-) The building is tucked in next to a church and secured behind a gate that is locked at all times. The staff, Ciro in particular, was friendly and very helpful. Based on Ciro's recommendations we ate some of the best food that Prague had to offer. Having a great place to rest your weary feet at the end of a long day of sightseeing cannot be overstated.

We stayed in a two-bedroom apartment on the first floor. The apartment was huge -- very large living room, kitchen, and hallway/study area. The second bedroom isn't so much of a real room, but more an alcove off the living room. The apartment was very clean with very new furnishings. Another big plus was the location -- convenient to everything in the Old Town, right in the middle of everything. The apartments are located next to a church on a generally quiet plaza. At night, however, groups of youths like to hang out at a bench right in front of one of the bedroom windows. There was a fair amount of noise and disturbance on several nights from these people. Other minuses: the apartment has minimal staple supplies -- really only dish soap; there was a dishwasher but no dishwasher detergent to use with it. Also, there were problems with hot water outages. In-room wireless internet service was spotty and temperamental -- you had to sit very close to the front door to get a constant signal.
