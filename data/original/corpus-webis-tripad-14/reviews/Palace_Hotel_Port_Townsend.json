They had a screen propped in the lower quarter of the window and a large fan on a stand to cool the room (how charming)...it sounded like a jet engine. We took a look at several of the other rooms whos doors were standing open and inquired at the desk if any of them were available (especially since none were all to special, but at least they were on a lower floor so we wouldn't have to haul baggage up all the flights to the top floor). The room we were really interested in we were told was taken but were offered a lesser room at $20 more than we were quoted for the room we wanted. We decided that even though it wasn't wonderful by any means at least it was bearable and we were committed to stay there (although we would have loved to have changed hotels altogether).", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 18, 2005", "id": 3788298}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Wow.

The Palace Hotel is a quaint old hotel in the old downtown portion the the town with convenient access to shopping and dining. Our small room was at the rear of the building which we thought would be quieter than one at the front which faces the main street. Boy were we wrong! At 5:15a.m. a loud boom-boom, thumpity-thumpity music began vibrating the floorboards in our room awakening my wife and me. By 5:30 when it hadn't stopped, I dressed and went to investigate (there are no phones in the room by which to contact the manager). I could not find the source after walking around our second floor, or up on the third floor, so I went down to the first level and still couldn't find the source. I went outside and walked around the entire block but without luck in locating the source. Upon my return to the hotel, I found the \"after hours\" phone in the hall and used it to awaken the manager and lodge a complaint. He came down the stairs, looking somewhat disheveled (as one would expect at that hour in the otherwise sleeply town) and said the sound was probably coming from the kitchen of the Tyler Street Coffee Shop which is located directly below our room and he would call there and check it out. Seems he was right; the baker usually starts around 5:00 and apparently on this day liked to have some loud music (to help settle the muffins?) while working. The music level did seem to decrease after the manager called... maybe from 125db down to 100db or so! Later my wife went down to the offending bakery/coffee shop for a cup of coffee which turned out to not be as good as the cup I made in the room. So, two lessons learned: don't take a room at the rear of the Palace Hotel and don't get a cup of coffee from the Tyler Street Coffee Shop. A little later we had an excellent breakfast at the Salal Restaurant which is a couple of blocks down the street from the hotel.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ElizabethMartin", "date": "April 3, 2007", "id": 7277466}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007", "text": "The Palace Hotel was great!
