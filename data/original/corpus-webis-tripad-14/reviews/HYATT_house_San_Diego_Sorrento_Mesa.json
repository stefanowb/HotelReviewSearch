We stayed in the room right next to the elevator. I'm thinking noise all night. I was wrong. No noise. No bells. The room was huge. The size of a 1-bedroom apartment, with everything from a dishwasher and stove, to steak knives in the drawer. The beds were among the most comfortable I've had in any hotel in any price range. Breakfast buffet was great. Chaotic on Memorial Day weekend with families, but a very large assortment. I've never seen Miso soup at a breakfast buffet in a hotel. Free Parking. Free Internet.

We were happy with this hotel and may stay here again. The staff was nice and friendly. The room was clean and spacious.We had the executive business room and iIt had a full size refrigerator, microwave, stove, cooking utensils, pots, dishes, glasses, cups, and dish washer. There was a king size bed in the room which we thought was really comfortable and a seperate lliving room with a sleeper sofa, 2 tvs and one with a dvd player. You can borrow dvd's downstairs in the lobby for free, 2 at a time but the dvd selection is very limited. There was only about 30 dvds to choose from and they were mostly the old movies like forest gump, charlie's angels and a few kids movies as well. They do have the disney channel which was nice for the kids so we mostly watched that instead. You can also request a crib which we did for my youngest son and you will get an evenflo portable crib. For some reason we had some trouble getting one into our room though. I had asked for one when I first checked in but an hour and a half later I had to call down to the front dest and ask them to bring one up. An hour later still no crib so this time I actually went down stairs to the lobby and told them that the crib has still not been delivered and this time finally they brought one to me about 10 minutes later. That was probably my only complaint about the hotel. The hotel was only about 15 to 30 minutes to all the places that we visited but it is located in a hotel/ business area so there is nothing within walking distance. No stores or anything nearby. I had to buy milk for my son and the closest place that sold it was at a shell gas station which was about 4 - 5 lights away. There is also a food court next to the gas station as well but most of the restaurants were closed on sunday. Only 3 were opened which was a japanese, thai and indian restaurant. In the other direction though which is about 1 or 2 lights down the street is a chili's restaurant and by the 805 freeway entrance is a mc donalds. The hotel does have a restaurant by the lobby but the menu is very limited. I wished that they had more items to choose from. Only a few items and nothing seems very interesting. Just salads, sandwiches and a few other things. We did order breakfast though, I had the omelet and my husband had the two eggs with bacon, and potato. Breakfast was alright but costed us about $20. On the internet it stated that the hotel has complimentary breakfast but they do not have one. I think they got rid of it because of the new restaurant that they have added to the hotel. They also have a small rectangle size pool and a hot tub. They also have a small area next to the lobby that sells drinks like champagne, beer, soda, snacks, and other stuff. Oh, and we had a room that faced a launching pad for hot air balloons. We had no idea and then on Sunday all of a sudden we looked out of our room and saw 7 hot air balloons. The kids got excited over that. I also thought that we got a great deal on the room too! We had payed $149 each night and that was on a holiday weekend! I had spent so many nights searching for the best deals on hotel and I was so happy to have found this one! It pays to do your research on prices because I had checked about 10 websites and they all had the same price for this hotel at $179 but only one website had it for the price that we payed. We saved about $80 for the two nights. I would recommend this hotel especially if you have kids because of the full kitchen and the size of the suite.
