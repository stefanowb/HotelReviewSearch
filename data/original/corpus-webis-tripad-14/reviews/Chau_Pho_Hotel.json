However, we were not at all impressed. Although our room was very large, with a three piece suite and lots of space, there were few other positives. The room had a strange musty smell which suggested dampness, although there was none evident. The bed was the least comfortable we had on our tour of SE Asia, and the light shining on the hotel sign on the wall outside made our room like daylight even with the curtains drawn. There were also intermittent strange noises through the night that we never identified. So we had a poor night's sleep. There were no public lounge areas to sit in and the whole place had a very downmarket feel to it. It is located in a backstreet that has no other tourist related venues, and the pavements were in very poor condition so walking was uncomfortable. In the end we gave up looking for a restaurant and ate in the hotel, which was of a reasonable standard although the room lacked any character and was largely filled with tour groups. Overall it is just about acceptable for an overnight stop but not a hotel to spend any time in.", "title": "Disappointing", "user": "Steve-G23", "date": "March 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 155581135}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Hotel is right at the market square and the noise carries over.

The bed unfortunately was very hard and the pillows too high for my liking. No other options were available. We were disappointed by the breakfast, particularly after reading other reviews. A large tour group looked to be departing the hotel as we arrived for breakfast and there was not much on offer. All the bread was gone. Despite a number of staff wandering around and cleaning up, 15 minutes later there was still no bread available to the many guests who had, like us, arrived. We opted for an omelet and rated it as the worst we have ever had. The juice tasted as though it was a powdered mix.
