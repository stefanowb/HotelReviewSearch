The handle of our frying pan fell off when I picked it up, but everything else was clean and we found we had everything we needed. The bathroom had a large mirror and sink area, I always find it a little awkward to put my make up on when I can\u2019t lean closer to the mirror, due to the sink area sticking out, but there is another large mirror in the bedroom. The shower was okay, its not very powerful and the hot water runs out pretty quickly, but doesn\u2019t seem to take too long before you have hot water again. The bathroom was clean, although there were some badly rusted bits under the sink area, which I only noticed when I sat in the bath and didn\u2019t bother me in the slightest, but I expect it\u2019s something that would bother some people.", "title": "Nice place, long walk into town, below average food...", "user": "SusieGSheffield", "date": "February 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 96774668}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were self catering and did not eat in the restaurant; and the pizza place near the pool within the complex was shut the whole time we were there.

I believe there was karaoke, a birds of prey show \u2013 didn\u2019t last very long but was good and could have photos taken, ABBA tribute night, music quiz, and I think there may have been a magic show one night too.

Breakfast was ok, full English - bacon a bit plastic and tasteless and a couple of days there weren\u2019t any \u2018proper\u2019 sausages \u2013 the little tinned ones were awful. However, the eggs (alternated daily between scrambled and fried, hard boiled always available), tinned toms, beans and fried bread, etc all fine, fruit was fresh. The so called continental - one type salami, one cheese \u2013 pretty rubbish compared to similar hotels - cereals low quality imitations. Tea and coffee ok but fruit juices low quality - I don't expect freshly squeezed but at least a better quality concentrate would have been nice - I've had better in other 3* accommodation. Evening meal a bit mixed. Salads always fresh, bread not so. Hot meals a bit lacking and as others have said, tepid at best. The Christmas Gala meal (As Thomson promised in their brochure) was laughable. Turkey roll sliced by the chef behind the counter in an attempt to put a bit of positive spin on the evening. It was awful really as you\u2019d have thought you'd get all the trimmings that comes with a Christmas Dinner. Nope, just chips. No gravy. Yes, it was cold. The rest of the week was the same story. Lacking of choice, tepid food. I have been to many similar places in the Canaries and the Med over the past 20 years or so. This is the worst I\u2019ve experienced. There's a serious problem with plates, glasses and cutlery running out. Not enough staff to keep things in check. The fact that we had to walk through the smoking area (indoors) each morning and evening to get to the restaurant was just bad management by the hotel. I\u2019m a social smoker but this wasn\u2019t what I wanted to endure every day, thanks, especially with my kids. At lunchtime the restaurant opens but we didn't use it. We used the buffet at the poolside bar. Basic burgers, hotdogs, pizza - a couple of days there were jacket potatoes. Not too bad but the burgers and sausages were again extremely low quality. Salad was always fresh. Ice cream (small pots of Nestle) was always kept frozen - so none of that crystalised defrosted/refrozen ice cream that you sometimes see. We ate out three times, twice in Correlejo and once just down the road at Tiffanys - a decent place for English food - their home made puddings are excellent.", "title": "Pity food not to standard of facilities", "user": "ColinCBristol_UK", "date": "December 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 89001467}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011", "text": "I stayed at the Oasis Papagayo at the start of February and had a fantastic time!
