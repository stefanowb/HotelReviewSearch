The room smelled like a bar on a Sunday morning. Stale, old and run down. It may have been clean, but I was scared to look too carefully.

Arrived to a very spacious clean room, but very old. Duct tape, that's right, duct tape held on one of the wheels on the bed, and held together a blind on the window of the door. No shampoo, hair dryer, or tissues in the room, so bring your own. Thank God I packed all of that stuff. No stores really close, so if you are going to shop, you are going to drive. Pool was nice, kids loved it. Breakfast at the restaurant was excellent. $40.00 for the 4 of us, which is average. A couple of nice restaurants within walking distance. Hemingways very good, but pricey. Hotel has 10% off coupons good Sun-Thur only. Kids enjoyed game room also. Boardwalk and Beach 2 1/2 blocks away. Beach is very clean. $5.00 per person for the day. 11 and under are free. After 4p, it was free. That was on a Thursday. Not sure about the weekend though. All in all, we had a good time, but if you like a little higher class of hotel, and don't care about the distance from the beach, I would stay in Tom's River.", "title": "I'd go back anytime", "user": "Pappy60", "date": "July 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 33818271}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I go down to Seaside every year and check out some of the hotels to see what they look like because you can never trust the website (take Aztec for example-NEVER STAY THERE) and being within the state I have the opportunitiy to do this. I had checked out a few hotels and priced them out to see which would fit our budget and what rooms would fit our needs. Hershey was the last one we looked at and were allowed to look around and check out all the different types of rooms. After doing so, we decided on the 2 bedroom suite for the dates we needed. The lady there cut us a break for one of the days because of the Holiday weekend(4th of July) and the days we were staying had fallen on a Sunday, which should have been more. I had called prior to our stay to make sure everything was set. Indeed they were and we were on our way. BUT, when we got there, our room wasn't ready!!!???!!! Are you kidding me, you just confirmed 3 days ago we were good to go. Yes, I was a little perturbed so thank goodness my boyfriend had gone in when this happened. They gave us the one room suite for that night and cut the price in half for that night. So after unloading only part of the car, since we would be moving to another room the next day, we went to the beach. When we came back we stopped in the office to pick up some flyers and to find out about the restaurant which is conveniently connected to the hotel. At that point they told us that the room we originally were suppose to have was available and we could move into it that night. GREAT! Thank goodness I didn't unpack everything. Again, a little annoyed but keeping cool. By the way the room they gave us in place of the room we were suppose to have was very nice, clean, and big. When we got to the original room, I was still impressed. Clean, big, and the kids were so excited-THEIR OWN ROOM. the only thing is the sheets are very thin and the comforter was old. I would suggest bringing your own blanket and pillows. It was noisy at times but I was able to sleep so it couldn't have been too bad. It was also 4th of July weekend so it was busier than usual. The pool was cleaned and kept up with every morning and every night. I saw the guy cleaning it every morning and the other guy cleaning up the pool area every night. The staff, overall was very nice, helpful, accommodating and the hotel was convenient. Very close to the beach and boardwalk, CVS, the waterpark and local bars and restaurants.

Who needs one now with cells, but still. They offered room service so I guess the would have to call the place on you own phone to get it.
