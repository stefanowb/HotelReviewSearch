The space between the double bed if you pick the wall side is about 9 inches so be prepared to climb over the bed. Comfortable mattress and pillows but air con non existant. When my husband asked Reception if it could be turned down they said they had turned it off as it was very cold outside ! hello this is August Bank Holiday Saturday and its 21C outside and does'nt drop over night. The in room bar/fridge was hardly cold enough to cool a bottle of Fanta never mind chill it. Outside area was clean and play area for children good, pool clean but no person visibly took the challenge to swim or sunbathe. Car parking was adequate and close to Carrefour and Casino restaurant if you prefer something less formal or expensive than Hotel restaurant. Situation is super for overnight to pick up major routes but as this hotel is usually 102\u20ac plus 10\u20ac for an animal its over priced. Other brands within same group of Accor and other brands close by better value. We pass Rennes every month and thought it might be an interesting city as its the Brittany parliament but apart from the timber framed houses and the Saturday morning market alot of the centre has an abandoned air many shops empty and a few restaurants with pavement seating. I was hoping to enjoy the fact two major waterways joined here but nothing interesting at all - much more interesting walks further out near Hede and Montreuil sur Ille has more to offer in scenery and walks.", "user": "NormandieGirl", "date": "August 28, 2011", "id": 117362181}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very comfortable for an overnight stay", "text": "I chose this hotel as 2 overnight stops before a long journey to and from the Pyrennees.", "user": "generous69", "date": "August 10, 2011", "id": 116512284}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "good hotel, with comfortable rooms", "text": "It is situated just off the Rennes ringroad next to Alma shopping centre so it is easy to find.", "user": "TheDutchTraveler007", "date": "August 4, 2011", "id": 116245375}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Holiday Stopover", "text": "Hadn't visited this hotel for a few years.
