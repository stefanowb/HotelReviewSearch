As already commented on by many, the grounds are well kept and the various buildings are spread out. Where your building can make a huge difference! Buildings 1-10 are centrally located but they surround the loud and rowdy pool. If you like that, it\u2019s a great location. If you don\u2019t, steer clear of it. We stayed in building 21 and it was one of the closest buildings to the Select beach area. The section of rooms in buildings 20-25 are great if you want to be a quick walk to the beach. Because of where they are located, your balconies are very secluded and some of the rooms have partial ocean views. In terms of the Select Club rooms in buildings 70 and up, as was already mentioned by a writer, I would agree that it is a scam to get you to stay there by making you feel special. The rooms are farthest from everything, especially the beach. The plus side: they are the newer rooms and are more updated. If updated is more important than being close to the beach, it might be a good fit for you.", "title": "OMG Some people are never happy", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "sarah5320", "date": "August 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19140236, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 select club beach house and pool area", "disliked": "\u2014 people who are never satisfied"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "ROOMS", "title": "Nice, but not as good as it used to be", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "xrustall", "date": "August 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 19119400, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Select club beach area", "disliked": "\u2014 Pools"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We were upgraded to the Select Club.

We had some airplane problems which delayed us a couple hours. This apparently got us into the Cancun airport around the same time as several other planes. The airport was a nightmare. We spent over 2.5 hours in lines at the airport. They did little to alleviate the problem. I thought possibly they would add more agents but this is Mexico so they didnt. It was painfully slow but we eventually got through. Because we were so late we had difficulty finding our luggage and there werent many employees that spoke English so this added to our frustration. After about 3 hours we were out of the airport and on our way to the Caracol. Check in was a breeze, probably because we were so late. We were shuttled to our room We stayed in a Double Standard that was back in the jungle somewhat behind the Lobby, Room 3501. The room was nothing to write home about. It was small but clean and the air conditioning worked great. The mini bar was stocked with soda, water and beer. Good start. The first couple of days it drizzled on and off and one evening we were all asked to return to our rooms and stay there from 10 pm til dawn due to tropical storm Dolly that was milling around off the coast.

The beach was a bit rocky but when the weather cleared so did the water so it was easier to walk out into the water because you could see the rocks. There is some kind of \"eco tube\" that goes around the beach supposedly to keep it cleaner. I thought this tube was kind of an eye sore and took away from the view. A lot of kids and adults crawled and stood on this tube and jumped into waves. A word of caution. These get slippery and they are kind of like a burlap material where you can get scraped up. On the other side of this tube there was some snorkeling available. You could see the standard variety of fish you see at all Carribean Resorts nothing out of the ordinary.
