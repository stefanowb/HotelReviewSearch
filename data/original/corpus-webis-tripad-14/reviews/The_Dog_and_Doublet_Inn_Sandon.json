Dinner was excellent ,albeit from a set menu for the deal.When the staff realised that it was our wedding anniversary and my wife's birthday,they surprised us with the dessert served on platters inscribed in icing sugar saying\" Happy Anniversary\" on mine and \"Happy Birthday\" on my wife's.

Well appetisers of olives and chippolattas were good and starters of mint pea soup and sea food salad were excellent! Mains of duck breast were excellent the best duck I've tried anywhere and sea food linguine was good although a little on the spicy side. What topped it of was the deserts of Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the chocolate torte which were both excellent and the Italian liqueur coffee. With out those I'd give it 7/10 but with them 8.5/10.
