However i must say we were very pleased with our choice. The twin room was a decent size, the bathroom you could move in and it had a great kitchenette, with a miocrowave, fridge dishwasher etc. Its in a good quiet location and its only a 5 minute walk to the nearest underground metro station, and also the great resteraunts at the Bercy Village.
