You can stay in your own bungalow, dont need ac because the fans they have are so strong you will shiver. Quiet relaxing spot. Laze in the hammock in the beach side fale all day long. Play chess, checkers, monopoly or table tennis, kayak, snorkel and enjoy the excellent food and great service. They dont have a beach, but neither do most of the places that charge you about 5 times more. If you are a beach person, take a 10 minute ride up to Siufaga beach (1 tala per person by bus each way). You can even go and use the awesome facilities at the Siufaga Beach resort (they have a great swimming pool with a pool bar and spa) for the price of a drink without paying for accomodation in the most expensive resort on Savaii.

Its not a beach, remember to bring swimming shoes, its rocky shoreline, great and safe for kayaking which we did almost everyday! The food is good, relax at the bar, dont expect too much of the swimming pool, its small and chest high only, but its so hot there that you just enjoy and relax anyway. Its close enough to the main town of Savaii, go to the market and walk about, take the bus for a ride. Tried to eat out one night, it was disaster, so learn my lesson to stay in for dinner, Poi is a good cook. My best time in Savaii is the day tour with Poi, up to the vocanic crater, dream of gaint creatures and little people settlement within the wild unseen forest inside the crater; to the seashore with powerful force of nature, the blowholes and the coral little fish on the rock pool, where did they come from? Finally to the waterfall and swim in its pool to cool down for the day. A tour is a must do when go to Savaii, you just can not get to these places on your own, a guide is needed.

I think many people who travel to Samoa miss out by not visiting the beautiful island of Savaii, which is an easy ferry trip from the port, which is located just 10 mins from Apia airport. I would highly recommend staying at the Savaiian hotel. It is close to the ferry arrival point, in the village of Lalomalava. Our room was spacious and clean, with all important air-conditioning. As we visited in the quiet season, we really felt like we got special service, with personalised tours and our own waitress who called to our room to take our dinner order, and ask us what time we would like it served ! The food was delicious and very reasonably priced, as was proven by the fact that guests from another hotel came to the Savaiian for dinner as they felt the food was better value than at their own hotel. The hotel rooms look out over the water, as does the restaurant / main building. There is a pool and Kayaks are available for guests. The location is also within walking distance of several of the local villages and shops, which is a good way to soak up the friendly atmosphere and see a bit of the Samoan culture. But the absolute highlight has to be the tours. We did two tours and between the two, we covered most of the island, taking in waterfalls, blowholes, markets, coastline, lava caves, volcanoes, lava-covered landscape, and also swam with turtles. We really felt at home during our stay, and would definintely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Samoa.
