From the moment I walked in I was impressed by just how well they had nailed the resort experience.The service at check in was impressive. The friendly desk person was diligent in finding two rooms that were near each other that we could check in to early. They could only find one room ready, but allowed us to check in to it and bring our luggage. They then said they would call when the other room was ready AND ACTUALLY CALLED MY CELL PHONE WHEN IT WAS READY!!!. The rooms were fantastic, we had one room with a resort view and one looking out over the golf course. Everything was in great shape and very clean. The pool, water slides, and the lazy river were awesome. We are not golfers so I could not speak to the quality of the courses. My wife and I dined in the Cibolo restaurant, and the boys ate together at the sports bar. We all had great meals. I was really impressed how affordable the food was. Cibolo was offering a BBQ buffet( which we did not partake in) for $20/ pp and it looked awesome. We ordered off of the menu and were stuffed. We were sad to go the next morning after enjoying the full service Starbucks near the lobby. I think Marriott has worked out most of the opening kinks and if they maintain this level of service, they will see me back again and again.", "title": "Best Marriott Experience Ever", "user": "jamlewis", "date": "June 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68229067}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed for 3 nights into Father's day on Sunday.

It is a long walk on a reasonably steep incline from self parking to hotel. If you can afford to pay extra for valet then this is not a problem. Overall resort was \"average\" qualityfor the price. Though Resort advertises that there are numerous dining places on site, this is not quite true. The food at the restaraunts was overpriced, limited selection and average. We had to order room service on numerous occassions because this was a better option. Also, had to drive 10 miles twice to neighborhood restaraunts since the resort is far from town. Upon check-in they ask you if you want to pay resort fee of $20. This is supposed to include 2 free drinks each day at the bar. What they do not tell you is only certain drinks (house wine and beer) are part of this deal. The average drink price at the bar is $10. The resort fee is also supposed to include internet access in the rooms. I had trouble accessing the internet and did not use this service during my stay at the resort. Some of the concierge staff had limited information about the resort. Eg. the person we asked did not have accurate information about the daycare center they had on site. The person sent us down to the day care center, however when we got there it was shut for the evening. The house keeping staff skipped cleaning our room on one day. We were in the room, and told them to come 10 minutes later because we were leaving. However, they did not bother to return. On the positive side, the swimming pool and lazy river were outstanding. Thoroughly enjoyed floating on the tubes in the river.The resort is clean and the grounds are beautiful.", "title": "Overpriced resort for the value with a great pool and lazy river.", "user": "Raj88", "date": "June 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 67363998}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We recently stayed at the hotel.

The room was nice and the bathroom large with a separate shower and bathtub. The room also had a small refrigerator located under the tv. Unfortunately the room is not very soundproof. For whatever reason, the room doors close loudly echoing throughout the hallway and into your room. On one night, one of neighbors decided to entertain a few friends loudly into the night.

It took a while to get our drinks then we never got napkins nor did we get an extra plate to eat on after we asked several times. I am just very upset with my stay and very let down.
