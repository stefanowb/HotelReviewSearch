Arrived a bit before normal check-in, had an okay lunch, however our balcony room was still not ready. As a result, they upgraded us to suite which was fantastic, though no balcony. Wonderful view of the water and HK island off in the distance from the 7th floor. Room was spacious and had a kitchenette as well which we put to good use for breakfast instead of taking the rather pricey buffet breakfast downstairs, though we did try it the last day and found it just okay. We both had a couple of massages - both my wife's were good, one of mine was much better. Nice pool, though it unfortunately closed for the winter the day after we arrived - had one good swim but it was a bit breezy and pool was not heated - great view though. This place reminded us of the Hilton Millenium in Bangkok - similar layout, big lobby into a waterfront restaurant, great views, but lacking heart or style. It's fairly new and perhaps may develop over time; staff was great and helpful - and plentiful. Lots of dining places at the DB center, though it seemed mostly like a big food court. Don't think we'd go back to DB or this hotel - seemed like we were in an Orange County suburb.", "title": "Great hotel but, like Discovery Bay itself, no soul", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kurnalsam", "date": "November 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 185377654}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with family", "text": "As an ex-Hong Kong resident myself, I found the transportation getting in and out of the hotel area extremely complicated, especially weekend has different schedules from weekday.
