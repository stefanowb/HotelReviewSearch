We arrived at the hotel about 6 pm and there were only 2 clerks at the front desk, so it took some time to check in. I had reserved a Park Avenue room for about $80.00 and had requested a King bed and non smoking room. We were told the the only non smoking rooms available had 2 queen beds or they could give us a king bed in a smoking room, eventhough I had made my reservation a month before. The clerk's only response was that requests weren't guaranteed. She offered me a suite, but at an additional cost of $30.00 which ended up being an extra $47.00 with taxes and resort fee. I've never been denied a request such as a non smoking room and/or a king bed, but would expect an upgrade if they were unable to accomodate me. The room itself was clean but a bit aged. We were on the 26th floor so we didn't hear the roller coaster as others have mentioned. The atmosphere was fun, alot of action in the casino, a younger crowd. The restauarants are mostly fast food type with the exception of the steakhouse and a good Irish bar. I've been to Veas many times and just wanted to try NYNY. If you want a cheap mid week rate, this will do, but next time I'll pay a few extra bucks and stay at a higher end place.
