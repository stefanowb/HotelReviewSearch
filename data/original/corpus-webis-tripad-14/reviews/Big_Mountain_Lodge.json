The hotel is a 3 star at best. Clean, big rooms, although we were annoyed that we booked a \"one bedroom suite\" with 2 queen beds and a pull out couch and it was only one big room without any type of divider. The couch was right in front of the TV too so it made it hard for the kids to sleep and watch TV at the same time. (We asked about the 1-bedroom suite and the front desk said that was only for the king bed and sofa sleeper so I guess their website is a bit misleading?). The pool has a waterslide but it dumps into 5 feet of water so unless your kid can swim or you have a very tall adult to catch them, it it unusable for littler kids. The pool is also 3.5 feet deep at the shallowest end. The hot tub is actually outside so we didn't use that since it was pretty chilly in the morning. Breakfast was the run-of-the-mill continental breakfast w/ some hot items available. Decent hotel but I would probably find a place with a more kid-friendly pool when we return next summer.", "title": "Okay hotel, pool for older kids/adults", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HMTY", "date": "September 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140502433}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here for nearly a week when we hiked Glacier National Park.
