It was also well stocked with soap, shampoo, dish/laundry detergent, coffee, and tea unlike the other apartments we stayed in Bath and Paris. The 12 GBP/day underground parking was a challenge get into with the ultra-tiny car lift (we had a VW Golf). It does get a tad noisy at night with the pub crowd as we are only a few doors down from one but it didn't bother us. Our apartment was overlooking Young St. Close to shops and pubs/restaurants in New Town. Great apartment if you don't mind the daily 10-15 min walk to the Old Town where all the attractions are. Won't hesitate to stay there again, especially when the new tramway system is completed.", "title": "Modern apartment in the New Town", "user": "JasmineRice", "date": "July 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 134484221}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "As this hotel was rated as No2 on Trip Advisor, we had high expectations. We stayed for two nights the week commencing 2nd July. Having pre-booked parking (\u00a38 per day) we arrived to find no clear signs for under ground parking. The staff were pleasant but not really as welcoming as I'd hoped. After discussion with the staff we drove round the back of the hotel to find the already narrow street had been partly obstructed by several domestic waste bins. As we approached the entrance to the lift we found that this was just only wide enough for our car (Seat Ibiza). Not only that but trying to maneuver the car 90 degrees with the obstructions etc was extremely time consuming and difficulty! **Please take consideration to the size of your car as we were not informed until arrival about just how narrow the car lift was**.", "title": "Nice apartment but noisy with unpleasant view.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Nigglynee", "date": "July 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134099420}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a apartment on the ground floor - when we arrived in our room we were pleased with the apartment - very nicely decorated, clean and had plenty of utensils.

My partner's initial worry was garbage trucks first thing. We did request to move rooms however the staff reported that no room would be available until the following day and that the only ones that would be available would be still over looking the bins but on the upper level. We closed the curtains and chose to try and ignore it.
