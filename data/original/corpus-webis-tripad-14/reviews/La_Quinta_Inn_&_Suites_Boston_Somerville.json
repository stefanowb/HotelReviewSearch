A restaurant was almost in the parking lot. (99s and it was good for a chain). The hotel definitely left things to be desired but if you need a place to sleep and don't care that it might be right at the highway...this is truly good for your money. Hotel staff are adequate, the gym is never in use, and the ice cream vending machines are always open. For a nights stay this place is great.

The Assembly Square neighborhood around the hotel is going through some extensive upgrades and new construction, plus with the new MBTA station opening in the fall of 2014, this hotel will no doubt be in a great location. The rooms were adequate and the beds offered a very comfortable sleep with no issue regarding cleanliness. In my opinion, the rooms due lack modern d\u00e9cor but are typical of the majority of American hotels in room d\u00e9cor, which makes it difficult to believe that the hotel was built in 2000 according to some sources. Simple little things such as a bottle open and those metal tissue paper dispenser attached to the vanity offer more of flash back to hotels of previous decades than one built in the 2000s. Overlooking these little \u201ceye flaws\u201d, the room was very clean and temperature was controllable by the guest. We had no noise issue with the proximity of the Interstation 93 or the neighborhood construction. Adjacent to the front door of the hotel is the 99 Restaurant, a chain of family restaurants in New England, which can offer plenty of options and spot to grab a drink. For those \u201cout of towners\u201d, the neighborhood is relatively safe though I would say I would recommend walking from the T-Station after midnight. The hotel offers complimentary shuttle service to the MBTA station (Sullivan Station - Orange Line) as well as the airport. The shuttle runs at the top of each hour however a taxi to/from Sullivan Station will cost approx. $6.00. I had a couple disappointments: The hotel\u2019s breakfast was a bit of a disappointment, not so much due to its selection but because of the confined space of the breakfast room. The area is too small and we decided to skip the breakfast just to avoid the aggravation of the tight quarters (the lobby can also be tight especially during check out time). Thankfully, there is a Dunkin Donuts within 150 steps from the front door of the hotel. Then there is the \u201cpool\u201d which was really a 3.5ft. deep Endless pool. While my son was in the pool, at least 4 people walked in to look at the pool, only to ask me \u201cis this it?!\u201d and then walk back out. Signs on the wall add to the confusion\u2026 it is a \u201cpool\u201d or a \u201cspa\u201d? In the end, the LQ Somerville was a positive stay and I would certainly return again if the price is right.", "title": "Great Spot with Bright Future", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "May 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 161984047}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A wonderful place to stay", "text": "My husband and I have stayed at the LaQuinta in Somerville numerous times when we have been in Boston for appointments.

This time not so good.

(our bed was quite comfortable). could hear noise between rooms, but not horrible. the worst part was 1st day we were given a card with a phone number and told to call when we got back to the train station from downtown Boston, which we did (actually called from Boston as we were getting onto the T) and were told that they only came on the hour, thus a long wait in store for us, so we ended up getting a cab - no easy task as they don't sit at the train station. second day, we planned for the hourly arrival of the van, which somehow never arrived until almost a half hour late - we were told one van was down. we were cold and unhappy by the time we returned. so, mixed bag, the good part, clean and relatively inexpensive if you want to put up with the inconveniences. definitely impossible sleeping on the \"pull out sofabed\" which you might as well not open up.
