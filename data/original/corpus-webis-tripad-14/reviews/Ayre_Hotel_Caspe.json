First impressions on entering the hotel were that this hotel had a modern contemporary look and feel to it, with bright, spacy areas and funky-looking furniture in the reception area. Staff were friendly and very helpful - on entering the room we found that the safe was not working and reported this immediately, at which point a member of staff was despatched straight away to our room to \"fix\" it. The room itself was nice and clean, and of a reasonable size with adequate furnishings and a decent bathroom. We had breakfast on the first morning, which was of a fairly good standard and of the usual hotel buffet variety, both hot and cold, but as is usual in hotels we felt the price was slightly too high and had breakfast elsewhere in cheaper cafes for the rest of our stay. The hotel is located in a fairly quiet street, with the nearest metro station about five minutes walk away. Placa Catalunya was about a twenty five minute walk away (ok, so we walk slowly but that's the best way to see a beautiful city like this!!), but there are a number of bars and restaurants nearby if you are feeling less energetic. Overall, I enjoyed this hotel. Good location, clean, decent room, friendly staff, reasonably priced and I would recommend it.", "title": "Enjoyed our stay at the Ayre Hotel Caspe...", "user": "Jaymo70", "date": "September 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 20191688, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good location; modern contemporary feel to the place; bright spacious foyer; decent clean room", "disliked": "\u2014 Price of breakfast was a little high"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel is contemporary modern looking (for me, looked like everything was from Ikea) and clean.

Later on, we found bus stops near by and it was easier to get to most of the popular site. On the second day of our stay, me and my friends booked the sauna, which is situated at the basement floor, so we let the receptionist know when we wanted to use as the hotel guide instructed to book it at least 90 minutes before the time we would like to use. It was great that the sauna was ready and hot when we got there. On the next day, we did the same but the receptionist (different person) said it is not necessary. However, the sauna was switched off and we had to switch it on and wait for 30-40 minutes until it get ready. Another thing I might mention is that there was noise of vacuum cleaner from the corridor every morning at around 9am. It was as loud as we couldn't stay in the bed.
