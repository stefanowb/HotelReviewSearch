Staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in Premier Garden Room which is on the ground floor and very convenient, with large shutters that opened up to a great view.Location was good(right on the beach) and close to night markets and food, although the hawker food in Ferringhi was a very small selection and quite westernised so we got a cab to Gerney drive where the food was so much better and the selection huge.That was probably my only negative about Ferringhi beach, the choice of food was minimal and catered to western palates. I would definately stay at Lone Pine again as It is much smaller than other hotels in the Area which I prefer", "title": "friendly staff fabulous rooms", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lexyAustralia", "date": "August 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117337037}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We're staying here for a period of 3 nights and as I write this we're still at the hotel.

When we informed the restaurant, the staff nonchalantly took the yogurt and just said 'thank you' and walked away.

All the lobby attendants were busy looking at the bikes and bikers without noticing our arrival at all! My hubby had to unload 2 big luggages and a few bags from our car and walked to the lobby. No one helped him and he had to do by himself and we had the feeling that my hubby was the portal working there! We waited for 45 minutes and our grand deluxe suite was not ready. While we were waiting we found out that there were some guests arrived later than us were served welcome drinks but we were still sitting without any welcome drink! By then I went to the attendant and told him if they didn't have the suite ready for my family I would just walked away! He quickly went and checked it out. Came back to us and said the room is ready but not the separate living area. So we were only able to use the room until another 1 hour (by then already almost 5pm!) to use the living area! After all these bad experiences we just concluded that we couldn't depend on their service... We just enjoyed ourselves in the bath tub at the balcony and swimming pool. Breakfast had varieties of local food but not tasty. When I called and wanted to order the special durian cake that the hotel restaurant promoted in their room brochure, they said this cake needed 24 hours in advance order. I wonder how the 24 hours in advance policy works? The location is very good, extremely poor service, average food, below average cleanliness. If you would to spend such rate in Lone Pine, I would recommend Rasa Sayang Resort & Spa or Hard Rock Hotel (King Suite only).", "user": "Onlyfools24", "date": "August 30, 2011", "id": 117473010}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "firstly catch a taxi - its a long taxi ride but just order it at the airport. the hotel charges a small fortune. free complimentary mocktail by the pool was nice and unexpected. Pool was a bit too cool though. dont know whether its a heated pool or it depends on the heat from the sun but we were reluctant to go in or stay in for too long. sounds picky as i know its hot and humid but in Langkawi at Pelangi Meritus the pool was perfect even at night. I also think the pool closes too early at 8pm. there were couple of nights when came home from sweaty night markets and just wanted to jump in the pool but it was closed. At Meritus its open till 11pm. I understand lone pine doesnt want any noise but I think a 10pm close is fine. There is a taxi rack right outside it you want to go to penang hill. Or if you want to go to georgetown just catch a bus at the bus stop right outside too (101 bus I think - about 5 MYR for 2 people - just watch your valuables) When you go outside resort turn right and walk along the street for short distance to all the night markerts and a lovely little bar on the beach called BORA BORA. Also great food at Jewel or the North. The bath tub outside is great. The breakfast is fine. Its a very clean and nice little resort. Very well maintained. Staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and new. A few tiny Ants around. I dont think Ive ever seen ants so small.
