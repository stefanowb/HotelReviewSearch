One block from Gloucester Tube station, adjoining supermarket, and nice cafes. We ate breakfast at wonderful little cafe down the street from tube, and had a nice dinner at Italian restaurant 4 blocks from hotel. Hotel is about a mile up the road from Harrods and is in a safe neighborhood convenient to the tube. Just a few stops from Notting Hill, Picadilly Circus, and Kensington. Hotel is 2 blocks from Museum of Natural History. Our triple room was very small, and I frankly expected more. Staff was friendly. I would ask for a room overlooking Cromwell Road, and not get caught in a back room. In short, location is nice and 10 minutes from center of old London. You can walk to Knightsbridge, Kensington Gardens, etc. Converted mansion is pretty, and is on a busy street.

We noted that there was no facial tissue in the bathroom and in about 45 seconds a maid came with a box of tissues. On our last day a tour group, due to a misunderstanding by the group-not the hotel, moved into the breakfast room as soon as it opened. They had to be sorted out, checked off, and so forth by the dining room head who did it all with patience and good humor. I was only observing but it impressed me. The breakfasts are worth storming the breakfast room for. They have everything from eggs to kippers, cereals to croissants, bangers to brie. The best breakfasts I have had in London.
