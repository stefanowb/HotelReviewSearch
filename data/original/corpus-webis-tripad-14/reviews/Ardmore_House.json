We felt we were inconveniencing the staff. Only one towel was provided for two people and upon asking for another towel, we were given the third degree. The shower head kept falling off its holder, and hit me in the head!! Ouch!! Breakfast was greasy and poorly cooked, but they have the right idea about what to serve.", "user": "xelar8", "date": "October 26, 2008", "id": 21214173, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pleasant building", "disliked": "\u2014 Poor service"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good Position near Thames Link Station.", "text": "The breakfast room is a lovely location to start your day.
