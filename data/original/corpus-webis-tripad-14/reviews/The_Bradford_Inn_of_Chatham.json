It is off season still and the Inn and the town were fairly quiet. The Inn is a compound of sorts with about 8 building on the property. While this does promote some more privacy than a normal Inn might have, it also reduces some of the charm of staying at a small new England Inn. This is more like a small hotel. The staff were friendly and efficient and the rooms and grounds were well kept. The room we booked had a king size bed , which was nice, but only one chair, which was a bit odd. One of us could sit in a chair , the other had to sit on the bed. When asked about this we were told we could have a room with 2 chairs but it would cost more. So the basic rooms have only one chair. The workout room had 1 treadmill, one elliptical, and one bike and some dumbbells and doesn't open up until 8am, so if your planning on some early morning workouts, your out of luck and with so few machines you'll probably be waiting in line. The outdoor pool was nice looking, we didn't use it this time but water seemed warm and clean. It has free wi fi which worked well during the stay. Breakfast as mentioned by others was quite ordinary, if not disappointing. A few choices of cold cereal, same each day, some fruit, English muffins or toast ,yogurt, coffee cake, orange and cranberry juice, coffee or tea. Very plain spread compared to other Inns we have stayed at, but bearable. I would suggest adding a few bucks to the rooms, if necessary, and add some bagels, muffins, hot cereal etc. It would make a better impression.", "title": "A quiet four days...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "boru77", "date": "June 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 163122737}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The Inn is right in town so it is easy to walk to anywhere to shop or eat, the location is great.

It was fun to view the various different creative interpretations. We stayed at the Bradford Inn which was a very good choice. Everything you would expect of a charming Nw England Inn.
