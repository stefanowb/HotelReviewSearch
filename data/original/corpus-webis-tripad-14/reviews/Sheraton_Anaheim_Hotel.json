The swimming pool is o.k, gets quite busy with kids though, and what a joke with the very heated jaccuzi, whats that all about in the middle of the summer. We picked this hotel because it was halfway between sea-world and universal which takes an hour and a half to get to each location which we pre-booked back home, the location of the hotel was dreadfull, right next to the freeway, no shops nearby, no pubs, about $20 later in a cab we find ourselves in the centre of the town (near the mariot) where its all happening so we will go there next time. Staff were pretty rubbish and didnt really care about there guests. Recommending VIP TOURS which we used to go universal which was amazing day out (definetely recommend getting a \"Gate A pass\" to skip all the ques, only costs $48 each but well worth it, got to do and see everything, Universal, huge dissapointment, recommend for kids though and be very patient with ques, deffinetely not a place for honeymooners, went on a city tour through hollywood and L.A.. recommended.
