Instead we stayed at the far inferior (and not very friendly) Hotel Boustigue way up a long and winding road. But we did dine at the Hotel de la Poste, and it was the culinary highlight of our week in France! Absolutely magnifique, with course after course of splendid traditional French delights-- five courses for 30 euros, or something like that! The appatizer tray at the start alone was worth the price (well not quite, but close). Getting to Corps is not easy (though LaSalette up the road is enchanting). But coming to the Hotel de la Poste makes it most worthwhile.", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "revjeff", "date": "January 6, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2983757}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Rhone-Alpes", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 19, "average": 15, "very good": 33, "terrible": 21, "excellent": 38}, "slim_ranking": 0.25}
