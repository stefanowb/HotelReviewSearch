The photos make the hotel look really luxurious however it is actually quite dated. Nevertheless, our room was a decent size with a balcony and sea view. The hotel was clean although it is very smokey! Breakfast was awful, a huge buffet of stale cereal and bread, eggs that have been sitting out for hours and revolting coffee. We were glad we weren't on half board! The location of the hotel is great as it's only a few minutes walk to the restaurants and to central Vodice, so it's great to use as a base. However given that we paid around \u00a3110 a night here we would have expected something a little more upmarket. There is plenty going on at the hotel if you are fond of karaoke and poolside activities!", "title": "Overpriced", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "JosieH", "date": "August 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8451753}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007", "text": "We have just come back from Two weeks in Croatia and ended up in Vodice for the Krka National Park (which is spectacular).
