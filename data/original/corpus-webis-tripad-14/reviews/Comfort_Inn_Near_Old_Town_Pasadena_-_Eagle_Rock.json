We had a handicapped room (it must have been the only thing available when I booked). Although the unit was clean, the carpet was very old and appeared dirty and worn. I felt that they took advantage of the Rose Bowl and Parade by making minimum stay of 3 nights and nearly tripled the price of the room. We did not use the third night and since we had two rooms this was quite an additional expense. I must say they did go out of their way to provide very good information about the parade, transportation, restaurants, etc. All in all, we were happy to be close to the venues and were in our rooms very little.", "title": "Great location for Rose Bowl game and parade", "user": "ocsurvivor", "date": "January 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 52985167}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled with family", "text": "My daughter and I stayed at the \"Comfort Inn Near Old Town Pasadena\" when we went to the Rose Bowl.
