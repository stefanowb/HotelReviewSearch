We stayed at this hotel for two nights to rest and tehn we took of from there to see Tuscany, a dream of ours.. The hotel was perfect, only a 1hr drive to Florence and 20min drive to Lucca.. The hotel was very clean with exelent service and had free internet at the front desk and in the room, wich was great for us. The hotel was very traquile and a very nice place to rest between our trips to the other cities.. We stayed a total of 8 nights at this hotel in this trip and it was a great choice, you never know exactly what you will get when you book a hotel online..

The hotel lacks charm but is acceptable and, most importantly, clean. The rooms are large by European standards. The reception and bar are poor. The gardens are pleasant but, when we were there ,the pool needed a clean. The breakfast was poor. The rolls were hard and the croissants did not appear to change in the four days we were there ! It was OK as a place to stay as we had a car and it is quite close to the autostrada. We easily visited Florence, Sienna, Lucca, and the beach. There are plenty of restaurants within a few miles. The restaurant that is supposed to be attached to the hotel was closed the whole time we were there and I think that it was probably for the best as it looked scruffy and small. We were told that ' the chef has had to go away suddenly and we don't know when he will be back ' - Oh yeah ! There is free internet access but it was limited for us to 2 hours.

However after unpacking and relaxing in the garden in the early evening we were attacked by mosquitos and bitten on all exposed limbs. The hotel is located in low-lying fields and surrounded by canals - perfect breeding grounds for the little bxxxx! The rooms are fitted with mosquito blinds so - don't open them, or you will be in for a difficult night! Food is available at the taverna next door to the hotel otherwise it is a drive or bus ride back into Pisa. We ate in the taverna on night one - fish was off and the rest of the menu was very uninspiring so do take the taxi option. On night two we found a very good Pizzeria in the next village so don't despair. Breakfast very uninspiring but at \u20ac5 what can you say.
