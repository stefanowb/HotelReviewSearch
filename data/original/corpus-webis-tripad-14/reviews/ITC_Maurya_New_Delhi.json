We ordered room service a few times and the food was great - not super expensive either (dinner for two was about 35 USD), considering it is room service at a luxury hotel. The hotel has a bunch of restaurants, but they are very expensive and considering that you are about 15 minutes from shopping and restaurants, it's really not the most economical option to go to one of the hotel's restaurants. Hotel service was great - very polite, extremely helpful, able to take care of any need you might have, in or out of the hotel. We were there over New Year's Eve, and they threw a big party - tons of people, fun music, and apparently all the big hotels do NYE really big (like something you'd expect in any big nightclub). Since the Mumbai bombings, I think, the 5 star hotels have gotten really serious about security - expect to go through bomb detection at the gates plus x-ray scanners and metal detectors at the door - but it's something to appreciate!
