The rooms were well appointed. If at all possible, get a room with a view of one of the impressive snow-capped volcanic peaks. The hotel has beautiful landscaping, gardens you can walk through, lovely terraces to relax in. Off the lobbly is a large room filled with wonderful couches and chairs in many separate seating areas. The hotel restaurant if very nice -- an excellent breakfast buffet with Chilean and American dishes. Food at dinner was good, but nothing to rave about. The bar was a lot of fun at night and also serves light meals. The staff is helpful, but be aware that many of them speak little or no English, although they will always try to find a colleague who does if communications prove difficult.", "title": "Charming surprise", "user": "dkmr", "date": "December 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188599670}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "For business travelers it's worth noting that the conference center on the lower level of the hotel is frist rate and a great venue for a meeting.", "title": "Enjoyable stay", "user": "Shaz M", "date": "December 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 186785323}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Patagonico for one night during November 2013.", "title": "Lovely gardens", "user": "BrightonGandalf", "date": "November 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 185806442}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "The room was large and comfortable with a gorgeous little garden outside the window - we were on the second floor.
