We have a great view of the tropical canal with many pleasure boats docked at private homes. Today is a bit windy and blowy as Tropical Storm Noel blusters by us, but we are well-protected and snug here on the sheltered second-story patio. We don't plan to go far for dinner, as a great restaurant, Coconuts, is a very short stroll away. Easy access as well from this central location to many other \"Key-sy\" eateries and shops. The management could not be nicer and the few things we needed (a light bulb or two) were delivered literally within minutes. The unit is great with a huge master bedroom, jucuzzi tub, two Queen beds and a spacious second bath. TVs' in every room and a great little sit-around bar for friends to chat at while drinking Margheritas rendered from the blender. Weather has not been ideal for diving, although my husband and I did win the Underwater Pumpkin Carving Contest sponsored by one of the local dive operators and was featured on CNN, the AP, Miami Herald, Comcast and was interviewd by a radio station in Great Britain by phone. As soon as Noel goes away, we will enjoy the free dive that we won. Just Love It Here! VERY laid-back resort with tidy, well-kept pool and hot tub, nice landscaping. Walk to fishing, snorkeling, diving or pick up a shuttle to the Casino Boat (free tickets with your stay included!) We will definitely be back!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "DiverDiver", "date": "October 30, 2007", "id": 10456605}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed here last June, and we took a group of 8.

There is ample boat parking and a resort marina if you need it. The rooms are a little old but HUGE and well laid out. My kids stayed for hours on the patio, it wraps around the unit and is one of the longest patios I've seen.

If you're looking for the Four Seasons, this isn't it. While this timeshare seems a bit dated, it is clean and everything works. It's in a great location for divers at MM100, where several dive ops are located. Rainbow Reef is our favorite because unlike most dive ops in the Keys, it puts a DM in the water with you. Anyway, the unit has a large bathtub and large porches, perfect for rinsing and drying dive gear. Since the bottom story is just piers in case of flooding, all the balconies are elevated so that your gear can't be easily grabbed by passers by. The tile floor in the living/dining area is a good staging area to set up dive gear. The bed and sofas are comfy. It's nice to have two bathrooms, a full sized fridge, a washer/dryer and an extra bedroom that can be used as a dressing room. As a timeshare, there's no maid service unless you pay extra. We like to travel in luxury most of the time, but for diving Key Largo, the convenience of the location, large size and layout make up for the lack of hotel amenities or view. It's also right across the street from Doc's Diner, which has the best breakfasts in town. Also, the WiFi is cheap and works well.", "title": "Loud, bad music all night and an older resort for sure.", "user": "clairann2000", "date": "January 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 23387987, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 porch view of the canal", "disliked": "\u2014 bar noise"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Sharkeys bar accross the street has loud, awful live performers who seem to have the amps turned up all the way and the music blasts right into unit 3 C like crazy.", "title": "Clean, well managed property", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ATourist6", "date": "May 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 16218367, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Size, washer/dryer", "disliked": "\u2014 Price"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with family", "text": "While Largo Villas are old, very large units with great wrap porches and well maintained grounds, they are frowsy, were not well cleaned, and the noise drove us nuts...we left a day early.", "title": "Key Largo Family Vacation", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "nuvi1", "date": "January 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12360349, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Large living area with full kitchen, very clean and quite."}}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 6, "very good": 13, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 3}, "aka": "Port Largo Villas Hotel Key Largo", "slim_ranking": 0.823529411765}
