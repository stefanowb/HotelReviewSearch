I actually only booked a standard room & haggled them down to \u00a3105. When we checked in we were sent to an executive room. I don't know why we were upgraded but I was pleased. Our friends payed \u00a3165 for the same room which I'd say was a tad overpriced. The room was clean & cosy. The bathroom was fab with a jacuzzi bath. Not sure about the black loo paper but hey ho! My only 2 small gripes were the poor lighting in the bedroom, useless for putting your makeup on (but the bathroom was well lit) and although the bed was very comfortable, the pillows weren't so good. We got a complimentary food hamper with sweets & biscuits. Breakfast was really tasty.

I was pretty shocked at that price- as I have stayed at many other establishements that were much cheaper and much more confortabale. For a starter, our shower had no water pressure. The lighting in the room was bad. The TV was only the standard channels(BBC 1&2, ITV and Channel 4) and the price for a movie was ridiculous. You had to pay for WIFI, which I was quite shocked by. Our room was very hot and stuffy. Luckily my partner is handy and could find a way to get the heat turned down himself. The bath room was small and the fixtures seemed tired. And, to top it all off we had to listen to a car auction for about 3 hours in the afternoon while trying to take a nap. The other problem was the hairdressers.
