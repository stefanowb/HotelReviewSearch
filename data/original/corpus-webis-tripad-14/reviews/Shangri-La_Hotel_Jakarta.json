If you need an ironing board, they will bring you one upon request. The bathroom has a separate shower cabinet, lots of high quality towels. They clean your shoes free of charge. Try to get a room with pool view. There is a lovely little tropical garden with a swimming pool. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Food choice and quality is excellant. There is a pub-like bar in the basement with a live band, that however was rather average. Security (access to hotel) is a high priority, you feel safe. No snags? Yes, some really minor ones like: No refill of coffee sachets, laundry was returned too late - but punctual after requesting, some items of the mini bar too many on the invoice. but corrected immediately.

Everything about them was great with not a single disappointment. But the one feature of the hotel which was nothing less then a mind-blowing outstanding was its buffets-especially for dinner. These buffets were more than 5 stars and as good or better than any others I have every seen. Not just in variety but most importantly in quality. There were buckets of shrimp that were 20 cm long, raw oysters the size of saucers, deserts which included several flavors of homemade ice-cream which could then be mixed with different ingredients alla Cold Stone style. There were different stations for different types of foods: sushi, Indonesian, Chinese, duck, Indian, barbeque, and on and on and on. Everything was top end. The Ritz Carleton Sunday Brunch in Newport Beach California was not as good. As a food lover, this dinner scene at the Shangri la will probably be my most favorable memory of Jakarta which is not a particularly scenic place. The price of the dinner was about $20 US and breakfast which was equally as good was included in my room.", "title": "RE : So So Hotel, OK if you are not demanding", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "BENLEE123", "date": "August 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5627771, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing in particular", "disliked": "\u2014 Poor Breakfast, Slow Internet"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "It's just okey, not as fantastic as the brand reputation used to be", "text": "There is a very popular disco in the basement of the hotel which has a reputation of being the hottest in town.

In Jakarta women think of cigarettes as \u201cglamour sticks\u201d and literally light up on after the other. I sat there and watched young ladies with a cell phone in one hand and cigarettes in the other strike glamour poses with these two prop. When you talked to one of them they had to turn away every few seconds to blow the smoke someplace other than your face. I did not find a single lady who did not have a cigarette in here hand there.

It was hard to reach hotel staff themselves and they told me the dress was lost. But after a few phone calls they said they found it.
