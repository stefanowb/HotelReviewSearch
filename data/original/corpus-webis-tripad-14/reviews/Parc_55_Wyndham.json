Not a plethora of restaurants near the hotel, and the doorman did advise (read: warn) us not to venture onto the streets toward the rear of the hotel. We took his advice and had a great safe trip.

After our flight was delayed, we arrived at the hotel late and checked in, only to walk in to a room that was already occupied, with the occupants in bed!

The rooms with two beds are very cramped, the windows were broken and we had to keep the shades drawn the next day because of window washing. The bathrooms have horrible lighting and almost no ventilation. I believe the fee for internet access was around $15, and although they did offer two large bottles of lukewarm Aquafina in the room for $4.50 each, there was no mini-bar or refridgerator. The beds were comfortable, but it was a little gross to find long blond hairs on the bedspread in the morning, considering that everyone in our party is a brunette. Also the fee for parking with tax is $50/night which we thought was pretty steep. All in all, we were disappointed with our stay. The location is OK, but definitely not the reason to stay at this hotel...... as far as the rest of the trip, we stayed at Ramadas and other common hotels where the rooms were clean and spacious, with amenities like free internet, parking and fridges.
