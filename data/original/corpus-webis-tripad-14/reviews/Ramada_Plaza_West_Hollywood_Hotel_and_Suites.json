Horrible is not even a strong enough word. We got back to our room on Saturday night to the smoke alarm going off. Called the front desk to see what the problem was, and was rudely accused of smoking in the room. Maitenence came up to the room and noted that we were not smoking, but just trying to sleep and reset the circuit breaker to the room. The alarm went off every 30 minutes for the next two hours. Their solution was to flip the breaker after each time the alarm went off. After this went on until 4AM in the morning, they decided to TURN THE POWER OFF TO THE ROOM!!! Great solution for the alarm, I'm glad there wasn't a fire. We only had to worry about our cell phones being dead, the food in the fridge going bad, and having to go to the bathroom in complete darkness with a cell phone screen as our only light. I called down to have them turn the power back on at 6:30, so we could take a shower and leave for the airport after one hour of sleep. I am very disappointed with our stay and how this was handled at the hotel level. I have been waiting over a day for the GM to call me back after numerous messages. The funny part is that the reception voicemall has the nerve to talk about customer service. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life.", "title": "If you are a decent person look elsewhere", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "dntstyhere", "date": "August 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 116130925}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled solo", "text": "Absolutely great hotel.

Families should be warned that hotel is at the fringe of an active gay community. The other downer is parking is $27 for twenty four hours, but it does seem the norm in the urban hotel.
