Fantastic view of the famous Mykonos windmills, as it is right next to them... Next to the whole \"Little Venice\" area while with enough distance to be quiet and peaceful. Owner is delightful, very sweet about pick up drop off and luggage storage... Rooms are immaculate and cleaning lady is very kind and sweet. Love Mykonos, Love Kymata.. if you want a pick up at the port just email them with when you're coming in and from where and they'll find you!
