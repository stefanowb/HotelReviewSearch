Simply put, this palace is fit for a king! Dresden itself is very underrated, charming, and chock-full of gorgeous architecture. The people are some of the friendliest I've encountered in Germany (with the exception, that is, of those who work in the Zwinger museums. They, I'm afraid, make the largely undeserved German reputation for brusqueness and an obsession with rules, seem deserved). Regarding hotel dining...I did not eat in the hotel restaurants, which are over-priced in the way you might expect for a hotel like this. My suggestion is, for some hearty German (Bavarian and Saxon) cuisine, head down to Paulaner's, which is located inside the hotel building, but appears to be managed seperately and accessed only from outside.

Also noticed a lot of tables had reserved signs on them so you couldnt actually sit anywhere - I have never heard of reserving tables at a bar.
