Its a family run hotel, and all the food is home made. We ate there 3 times, and tried many of the dishes on the menu.

I recently stayed for 4 nights in late May. We had booked the Canopy room but were upgraded to a larger room with a balcony upon arrival. The hotel is exactly like the pictures portray. I found the service to be excellent as a couple small problems we had were immediately responded to (the phone was hung up and someone was at our door within 2 minutes). Recent complaints from a prior post regarding sound issues and lighting were not found to be true. I'm typically very conscious of sound and we did not hear anything despite being on the first level right by a high traffic area for maintenance people. what made this hotel so special, outside of its luxury and views, is its location in Praiano. the town is wonderful only a short 5 minute walk up the cliff (approx 50-75 steps). the stores and restaurants all seem to be family operated and thus provide a true feel for the italian culture (more so than touristy towns like Positano and Amalfi). for those concerned about the breakfast not being included, i suggest walking into town, purchasing hot/fresh croissants and/or anything else you need. i did this numerous times for under 5 euro for both my wife and i. in comparison to the over priced breakfast offered at the hotel, this method is much better both for price and quality of food. we did not eat the hotel restaurant for dinner because we thought the restaurants in Praiano and other towns would be superior.", "title": "Nice, but not perfect", "user": "Gotupandwent", "date": "May 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16198288, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of soundproofing, harsh lighting in the bedrooms, high prices"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "as far as seeing other towns along the coast, the hotel provides a shuttle to positano for free. the bus is very easy to use for a return if you stay at night or any other time when the shuttle isn't running.
