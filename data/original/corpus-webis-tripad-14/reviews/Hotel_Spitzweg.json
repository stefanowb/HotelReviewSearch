We received a very warm welcome and although we arrived early - about 10am - our room was ready.

Our room was large, cosy and comfortable and furnished with lovely folk-art furniture. The bathroom was very large. There was a bath with a hand-shower and so we could stand and have a wash if we preferred. It was only about a 10 min walk from the train station (with luggage). It is located within the Alstadt which is just like it has stepped out of a fairy tale. It is exceedingly beautiful and although caters to tourists does not feel touristy. The market square is only a 5-10 min walk from the hotel. Our tariff included an amazingly huge and hearty breakfast served usually with a chat with Herr Hocher.

We had a triple room and it was one of the cutest rooms I\u2019ve ever stayed in. We arrived fairly early (we walked from the train station \u2013 15 minutes & just follow the signs to the city center) and even though there was a bit of a communication mishap between me & the owner regarding the time we\u2019d arrive, our room was still ready for early check-in (and the owner personally showed us to our room \u2013 he was so nice!). There were maps at the hotel and the owner showed us places of interest when we checked in so we\u2019d be set for the day. While I am sure they are around in the building, the front desk is often not manned, but you are given a key so you can come and go as you please so it was never an issue. The room was very comfortable with plenty of room for 3 (and unlike other hotels we stayed out the 3rd bed was actually a bed and not a rollaway or a converted couch). The bathroom is spacious, but it did take us a few minutes to figure out how to use the shower (pull up on the lever & then turn the shower on). When we checked in the owner inquired about our departure time and he was kind enough to start breakfast early for us. Breakfast was great - the owner personally made up a meat & cheese platter for us (so huge for 3 people), there were fresh rolls, the usual drinks, and my favorite part \u2013 fresh fried eggs that were utterly delicious! The owner also likes to chat with you in the morning and you always feel very welcome in his hotel (he also made sure we took some fresh fruit with us to eat on the train). The hotel is in a great location (although I\u2019m not sure if there is a bad location as long as you are within the walls since everything is in walking distance) with parking behind the building, the medieval wall is nearby, the city center is just a small walk away, and there is even a post office right around the corner so you can mail everyone postcards of the town!
