Very friendly and accommodating staff. Compared to the local camps for workers this place is about the same price, and is much quieter which is a great plus for me. That and comfortable queen size and larger plush beds unlike the single slabs I seem to get in camp. I do not find breakfast limiting at all....hot choices, cold cereal and a variety of toast, bagels and pastries. Perhaps some of the yoghurt could be fat free/sugar free but otherwise I find something I like. The other downer..it is very difficult to get a ten day block of rooms as this establishment is so popular and booked nearly fully weeks if not months in advance. Hottub is closed for repair...not sure if it ever has been open by the looks of it or perhaps they have not obtained the necessary licenses?", "title": "Sure Beats Camp!", "user": "a78jumper", "date": "November 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183316594}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Conklin"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 2, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 7}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
