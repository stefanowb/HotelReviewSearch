They will over charge you!", "text": "Not a bad place, it was a quick trip, so just wanted a place to lay our head. We checked at this one and also the motel connected to it. The other one was $25.00 cheaper but didn't have a pool. I think it's crappy they didn't let both places use the pool. The motels are connected! So my kids wanted a pool so we opted for this one. They told me it would be $104.00 total for the room for 5 people and a pet for one night. My credit card was charged $115.00. So I called and they said that wasn't their problem! I would not recomend this unless you have extra money to just throw away!", "user": "Kristy024", "date": "June 14, 2011", "id": 113529239}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "2nd trip was just as good as the first!", "text": "This was the second time we stayed at this hotel while visiting the American Pickers! Great stay again. First trip in December we had a hot tub room facing the river on the first floor. We had brought out dog and they allow pets, so it was perfect. This past weekend, we stayed on the second floor without a river view, but we were not in the room a lot, so it was no problems.
