It took us about ten minuites and a taxi wanted to charges us 30,00 Euro. There is a subway station within 5 minuites from the hotel. You can walk to about everything and when it is late at night and you are tired of walking and the subway is closed you can look for any bus with Termini on it and get back to this hotel very quickly. There is plenty of shopping and resturants nearby. We could not have asked for a better location.

It surprised me how small the place was (one floor in an office type building). It was close to the train which was good, but a good walk to the popular sites. It also is confusing to get around Rome and we got turned around easily (could be just me). The staff was beyond helpful and for whatever was lacking they made up for. The bathroom was clean and modern and the breakfast was also good. Staff was very good at making calls for taxis or giving directions. The staff definitely makes this place. Another plus, at night it is almost silent! We slept with our window open and even though there are things nearby, I didn't hear anything. I learned this is a big plus in Florence when I stayed at the LOUD Globus Hotel. I will say that I heard our neighbors in the morning through the walls quite easily, but no big deal.
