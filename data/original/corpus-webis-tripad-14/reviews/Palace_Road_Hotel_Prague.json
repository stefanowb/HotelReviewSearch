I believe I had the Marigold Room (it's been a year, sorry it took so long to write), which was very spacious, with floor to ceiling windows opening to a small patio, nice antique furniture, a modern kitchen. I shared a bath with one other room, just outside the door. At a very reasonable price for Prague. I'd say the only drawback is that you have to walk a couple blocks to another one of their buildings for the breakfast.
