We decided to take a break from the tedious drive back to London. We found the Talbot and decided to have a glass of bubbly. Whilst we were enjoying the open fire, a gentleman came over to say hello (I am sorry, but his name escapes me). He explained he was the new manager as he had only been there a few days, he would love to hear any comments we had. He left but popped back about half an hour later. We got chatting about food & local produce and how good the menu looked. We had a look in the restaurant and it was amazing! There are these huge glass doors and a very impressive copper ceiling!. We had a look at the rooms as well and decided to stay over. It was a little more expensive than we were expecting but all the rooms are all brand new as they have only been open a few weeks. The menu and food was easily of London standard but the most impressive thing was the friendly and efficient staff and most of all, a manager who cares! We mentioned it was my birthday and I half expected the customary candle in my pudding or a glass of something but it didn't happen. On returning to our room, I found the nicest little thoughtful touch; the manager had put some lighted tealights and strawberries on ice in the room. There was even a card from him & his team!", "title": "Excellent Michelin Starred Chef Restaurant with Rooms", "user": "JRich174", "date": "November 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 21582994, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The quality of the food in the resaurant and the clean rooms!", "disliked": "\u2014 The heating goes off at night!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stumbled across this charming hotel by mistake - we were doing a bit of sight seeing before leaving the uk and what a wonderful wrong turn it was.", "title": "Wonderful & Relaxing stay in beautiful surroundings!!", "user": "Pommeinoz", "date": "March 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 26957876}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009", "text": "We were pleased to find that the Hotel had a room for the evening at a very good rate and so after a friendly welcome at the reception desk we went straight to our room.", "title": "A Hidden Gem!", "user": "2wander4ever", "date": "March 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 26951367}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We found our bedroom to be a very good size it was spacious and stylish, we loved the original characteristic of the room that were inkeeping with the building.

A super place for dining as it has the old inn beneath the bedrooms and the new brick and glass conservatory bistro. Everything that you could need in delightful Surrey. Very close to Wisley. Staff very friendly and helpful, dining a treat both for Sunday lunch and evening meals and close enough to Heathrow to use, but I should not tell you that because don't want everyone using it, in fact why am I writing this review?
