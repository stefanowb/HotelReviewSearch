Actually it is a pretty good hotel. Staff were very efficient and friendly. NOTE: Make sure you ask for non-smoking room if you don't smoke. Otherwise you will drown in the stale cigarette smell. The upgraded rooms on the 28th floor were lovely. Very clean, lovely comfortable beds and fluffy doonas etc. Most Japan hotel rooms are small, and the Prince is no different. However still very very comfortable. The hotel is so easily accessible to the JR and subway line it is fantastic! Even if you have never been to Japan before, it is very easy to use. And located just across the street from the hotel.

The room I stayed in was a updated room and it was amazing. Of course in Japan it was smaller then normal rooms but the way its set up makes it seem bigger. I would recommend getting a room on a higher floor because those are the more updated rooms. I also got the breakfest add on to the room each day. I tried almost all the choices that they had available. The one I would recommend most is the buffet in the main tower next to lobby forgot what its called. The hotel has so much you can do. I didnt get to do all of it but I did go bowling and after getting in for the night I did some kareoke. Bowling was fun I went during the evening when all the business people were there and they are fun to watch. Kareoke is HUGE in Japan and the hotel had its own. You pay for the time you want and get your own room that fits like 10 people. Me and a friend got a room for about two hours and you can stop a song if you get bored and pick a new one and they can also bring you drinks. The staff is so nice they also said hi when you walk by and if you need help with something and even though they try to understand you they go out of there way to find someone or walk you to where you need to go.
