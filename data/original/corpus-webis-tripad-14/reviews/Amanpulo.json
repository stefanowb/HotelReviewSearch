From the point of arrival to the Manila, the service starts. Staff are waiting to greet you upon exiting customs and they take you to the private airport and Amanpulo lounge which is nice after a long flight. The small plane you take to the island is not at all scary and in fact was quite enjoyable (only about 1 hr max). The GM and staff are there to greet you and immediately you get a tour of the island on your private club car (golf cart). The beaches are pristine and I have to say the weather during Christmas was perfect. Enough sun for the kids, enough shade/overcast for the my wife and I with temperatures that didnt make you sweat. The water in the pool and the ocean was cool but not cold. Beaches were clean, soft like corn starch with an abundance of seashells.", "title": "Bliss, perfection", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "AmericaninNZ", "date": "January 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 91356667}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The food is first rate for an island (4 out of 5 stars) with the pizzas at picnic grove winning the day.

Everyone knows your name and the staff remember details that make the stay easy. For example, they remembered the size of fins my daughter used so that each time we went snorkeling the fins were ready to use without my asking. The only area of improvement is in \"communication coordination\". we were set to do a boat ride and my guest assistant said they would call when ready. They never called and instead were waiting for us. I felt guilty about being late as I know they all work so hard. My guess is that the staff didn't want to rush us, let us relax without the pressure of time. That's awesome but again, communication coordination is important given the clientele.
