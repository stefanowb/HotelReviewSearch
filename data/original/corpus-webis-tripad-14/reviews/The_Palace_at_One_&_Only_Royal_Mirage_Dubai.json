What an amazing experience.... I almost cried when it was time to leave! The hotel is one of the most beautiful I've ever stayed in. The Arabic architecture, interiors, and landscaping made you feel like you were in a totally unique place. We forgot the outside world entirely and enjoyed the beauty and tranquility of the place. The pool was the absolute best pool we've ever been in. The ''floating'' palm trees meant that the dabbled sunlight came through without inflicting too much severe sunlight. There were lots of little nooks and cranies in the pool, so you had space to have your privacy. The restaurants were the absolute best. Based on advice from this website, we booked ahead, so reservations were no problem. We loved our dinner at Ninas, where we enjoyed one of the best Indian meals we've ever had (and we've lived in India for 6 years!). However, nothing compared to the incredible meal we had at Tangines! The food, the service, the atmosphere were all top-notch, and all made for an evening we'll remember for the rest of our lives. The staff throughout the hotel couldn't have been more gracious, and everyone remembered our names and room numbers. We'll be back, for sure!", "title": "Didn't want to leave", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "LauraKK", "date": "August 26, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3809334}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "one and only worst hotel experience", "text": "Following is the complaint letter submitted to hotel manager following our stay:", "helpfulness": 41, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 23, 2005", "id": 3798972}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "I am writing to inform you about my complete dissatisfaction with a recent stay at one of your company\u2019s properties.", "title": "Class...", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ImranLondon", "date": "August 17, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3780886}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "Have just returned from a very short stay at the Palace, Royal Mirage, and just had to write to say how fantastic it was.

We ate at the Beach Bar a couple of times and each time were not disappointed. We also dined at Olives which was excellent value for money.
