The staff are friendly, our room was spacious, quiet, modern, and clean. Our room had a mini-fridge (handy for cold drinks and breakfast snacks) and good air-conditioning. There's a small pool onsite and restaurant and bar. The hotel is several blocks from the main town but there is a bus stop only a half a block away, and the hotel is close to laundromat, pizza restaurant, grocery store, and bakery. We walked into town each day (nice bit of exercise). One day we took the city buses to the local beaches, and enjoyed ourselves immensely. We paid about $85 AUD for two people per night for our room. Overall, a pleasant stay and relatively good value.", "title": "A lovely, clean, friendly place to stay", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "WBinBC", "date": "January 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4389948}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a way to Relax!", "text": "just a great location, \"Green\" and like walking into Bali, right in our own country!!!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "deb_pete07", "date": "December 21, 2005", "id": 4253845}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great place to stay", "text": "great room, beautiful pool, staff spot on.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 7, 2004", "id": 2624446}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A very nice little hotel!", "text": "we love travelling, but don't always stay 5 star!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 16, 2004", "id": 2452885}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 3, "very good": 9, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Fig Tree Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.80487804878}
