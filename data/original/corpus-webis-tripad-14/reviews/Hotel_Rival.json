We were not disappointed. It was very different from our previous hotel. We liked it equally, but for different reasons. The whole concept of the Rival is great - an old theatre (and apartments) turned hotel. The hotel bars and restaurant are reminiscent of the grand era of theatres of days past. Also, from the lobby to the bars and rooms, the hotel has a very retro feel. The neighbourhood is also interesting and the hotel is still an easy walk to the old town and other sites. We very much enjoyed our stay - from the ABBA (and other) CDs in the room, to the variety of DVDs that can be borrowed from the front desk. The coffe/tea alcove on the 4th(?) floor was also great. Breakfast was amazing but as per previous reviews, the staff are not too attentive so if you do want an omelete or pancakes, i.e. a special order, you may have to go to the cashier area to get a waiter/waitress to take your order.
