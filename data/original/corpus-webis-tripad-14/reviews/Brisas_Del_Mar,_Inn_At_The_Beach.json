We were fortunate to be in unit 29 - which has a view being on the top level (as would 28-30), but other units basically look at each other and over the central parking courtyard. The pool is small, but acceptable, with reasonable sun in the afternoon. The location is fine for people comfortable walking - as it is quite a few blocks (prob 20 min walk) to the main State Street district. The beach is closer, but still 10-15 mins to the pier walking. The wi-fi in the rooms is free but slow - much faster down in the lobby. The b'fast is adequate but simple, and free, and the afternoon wine/cheese is fine (cheap wine), and the evening milk/cookies is a nice touch. Free dvd rentals from the front desk - extensive list - just wish it was categorized by rating - or at least had a 'family' section as the ratings are not listed in the lists which can make it hard to pick age appropriate movies. For the price, location and amenities, a good place in SB. But it is not as fancy as their web site photos make it look. Room furniture is cheap and old, but beds are comfortable. Pillows could be better - who still has chopped foam pillows - really! No bath in our room - shower only.

Some rooms have beds near the front door, but our room had the bed in the back room. Much better option for a quiet sleep. The beds are very comfortable and the linens are good quality. The full sized kitchen is very nice and handy. There are two liquor stores within walking distance and state street is just a few blocks away.
