On our return trip home to Michigan, we thought about what we'd like to \"put out there\" so that other travelers might know what to expect when visiting this all-inclusive complex. There's nothing in our review that should discourage you from booking the GPB but, hopefully. a bit of information that you'll find helpful. When we deboarded in Punta Cana Airport, we were photographed with Dominican dancers and then hustled through a line where we were each required to pay a $10 \"airport usage fee\". It's a good thing we had cash, and you'd be wise to plan for this occurrence - we had no idea there was a fee upon entry. All of the vacation package specialists' booths were easy to locate (psst...the airport is very small). We had a short wait before beginning the 35 minute mini-bus trip to the resort. Check-in at the GPB went very quickly and smoothly (15 minutes). The property is large and the walkways are confusing to newcomers - if you stick to the covered walks, you'll have better luck finding your condo later that night when you've enjoyed the pleasures of the bar. The Grand Palladium Bavaro is actually the first of 3 side-by-side-by-side resorts along Bavaro beach. You move from one property to the next without really knowing it! Each of the three has at least one pool and several restaurants, including at least one giant buffet restaurant. Most of the pools have swim-up bars. The drinks are distinctly weak in alcohol and sweet. It takes a real effort and about 5000 calories to feel any effect. You'll have one choice of beers - El Presidente, a pretty non-presidential beer if I'm to be asked. The food in the sit-down-and-order-from-wait staff restaurants is very likable - nicely cooked and presented and served by professional staff. The food in the buffet restaurants is suspect, and I'm a guy who selects his food like a goat. \"Something\" gave each of us a 24 hour bout with \"the plague that attacks the bowel\". But, with a little Immodium AD and a certain sense of adventure, we ventured back to give the giant buffet hall a second chance with no further ill effects. I suspect the salad, my wife is suspicious of the lunch meats. Being a teacher, it's helpful for me to communicate in terms of grades (before grade weighting - let's say the 1960's). I'd have to give the buffet restaurants a C+ and the Ala Carte restaurants an A-. The soft serve ice cream, available at several buffets, is dynamite! The tropical fruits (esp. the pineapple) are wonderful. Let's go to the beach! The beaches are everything they're raved up to be - clean, alluring, gorgeous. I cannot imagine a more picturesque beach (presuming the absence of the topless elderly European women). There are beach bars located along the length of the beach, so you won't have to stumble any farther than 100' or so to get a fresh drink. People compete (translate - \"fight\") for beach lounge chairs. You'll have to rise with the mockingbirds and sleep walk to the beach early in the morning to lay your towel out and lay claim to your chair. Don't get too attached to it though - we experienced lounge chair theft. The beaches (and swimming pools) are the hawking grounds for an almost unlimited number of vendors desiring to sell you rides, excursions, experiences, cigars, sea shells, jewelry, hats....we couldn't find 5 minutes of private time without having to wave off a salesman. Walk down the beach - it's just as bad. Avoiding eye contact doesn't work - these are salesmen who are not to be denied!

Well, nobody ventures out beyond the roped-in swim area because it'd be suicidal! Boats winding in and out of each other provide part of the day's entertainment from the beach, but you wouldn't want to be swimming out there unless you had it in mind to visit the local health care facility (located right on the property!). We booked a $30 per person (for one hour of snorkeling) excursion to the local reef where the coral are dead but there are plenty of fish to view (because the guides feed them with bread from the buffet restaurants). No matter what snorkeling tour you book, you'll end up on the same reef about 15 minutes south of the Grand Palladium Bavaro, so book the cheap one! Our room was nice and clean, and the clean staff showed up everyday and did a very nice job (be sure to tip them!), but we never knew what time to expect them - one day they cleaned the room after 5 o'clock! Our TV never worked (we missed the UNC-MSU game, dang it!) in spite of our friendly inquiries to the maintenance staff. In our room and at certain sites on the grounds there was the \"backed up sewer odor\" Whew, baby! We got rid of it quickly by opening the patio door to a fresh breeze and some lovely scenery. The staff at the GPB was very friendly and helpful (except for maintenance - they were just friendly). We were definitely in the minority - Americans and Canadians constituted only about 10% (just a guess, not a fact to be taken literally) of the persons visiting the resort. Most of the travelers were Spanish and German, and we also noted that there were many French and Italian guests. We enjoyed listening to their beautiful languages and trying to figure out what they found so funny when they looked at us. It's a small world after all!!!! Well, it seems as though I have reached the limits of your patience and should wrap this review up. In spite of the minor criticisms that dominated the bulk of this treatise, we had a terrific 6-night vacation. I feel that the resort has enough positives (the beauty of the grounds, the cleanliness of the entire property, the effort made by the staff, the gorgeous beaches and clean pools, the relaxing atmosphere) to outweigh the criticisms I've cited. We both feel that the resort deserves our \"4 out of 5\" rating, and that to achieve the perfect 5/5 would have required an improvement in the buffet restaurants and a reduction in the number of salesperson assaults we were forced to tolerate.

The staff at the GPB was very friendly and helpful (except for maintenance - they were just friendly). We were definitely in the minority - Americans and Canadians constituted only about 10% (just a guess, not a fact to be taken literally) of the persons visiting the resort. Most of the travelers were Spanish and German, and we also noted that there were many French and Italian guests. We enjoyed listening to their beautiful languages and trying to figure out what they found so funny when they looked at us. It's a small world after all!!!! Well, it seems as though I have reached the limits of your patience and should wrap this review up. In spite of the minor criticisms that dominated the bulk of this treatise, we had a terrific 6-night vacation. I feel that the resort has enough positives (the beauty of the grounds, the cleanliness of the entire property, the effort made by the staff, the gorgeous beaches and clean pools, the relaxing atmosphere) to outweigh the criticisms I've cited. We both feel that the resort deserves our \"4 out of 5\" rating, and that to achieve the perfect 5/5 would have required an improvement in the buffet restaurants and a reduction in the number of salesperson assaults we were forced to tolerate. Oh yeah, and I'd like to see them ramp up the drinks...a lot.", "user": "GRYC", "date": "April 13, 2009", "id": 27955998}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "We had an absolutely amazing vacation!", "text": "My husband and I stayed at this resort from March 28-April 4, 2009 with another couple and had a fabulous time!

What an awesome resort. This was our 3rd trip to Punta Cana and it still excites me. It's a great country with great people. The Punta Cana beach is just beautiful, white sand and aqua waters, lined with lush palm trees. The resort, so far, is the lushest we've been on, so if you like lots of trees, flowers, and gardens this is the resort for you. Everything is kept spotless from the lobbies, to the rooms, to the grounds around the property. The room was great, lovely hot-tub right in the room itself, with a stand up shower in the bathroom. All marble floors throughout the resort, being lobbies, rooms, and public washrooms- even at the beach. The food on the resort was great also, there were 6 of us and no one got sick. If you go, go to the Brazilian restaurant for sure, it was the best A La Carte I've been to in a few years, and I go every year to one country or the other, and this one was top notch. You got roast beef, chicken, saucage, fish fillets, and shish-kabob, all in your meal, not choice of one or other, but all. Everything was cooked very tender and seasoned nicely. The pools on the resort were great, there are 5 in total, and very large so not over crowded at all. William at the main pool bar was totally awesome, very friendly and curtious. Always were able to find chairs on the beach and at the pools as resort is roomy so there are plenty. You have full use of the sister resorts as well, being Palladium Punta Cana and Palladium Palace. There are two multi-seated trains that run around and between the resorts so you don't have to worry about walking far as they run every 15 minutes. If you are walking, most pathways are covered so you are shaded from the hot sun. The nightly shows were very good and costumes worn by entertainment team were very beautiful- seemed that they were all new. There is a piano bar in the main lobby and the disco is right out front, next to the theatre, so everything is close by. Next to the disco is the sports bar which has 24 hour food service. This resort had the best pizza that I have tasted in these areas as well. Everything from meat, chicken, vegetarian, Hawiian, to just plan cheese...yummy! If you like ice cream, you have to try it here, from self serve- soft serve, to tubs you scoop out of as well, make sure to try the rum & raisin - there's RUM in there!! We found the drinks to be very good here too, but the food was so good and plentyful, made it hard to find room to put the drinks in sometimes :) There are also many turtles, fish, and flamingo's around the main lobby, makes for great picture taking with the flowers and trees in the background. When you hit the beach, to the right (10 minute walk) there are about 5 or so shopping huts. They are very aggressive there, so if this bothers you and you like to do the hut shopping thing, go to the left from the resort, BUT you will have to walk farther. A lovely 40 minute stroll down and back past lots of other resorts along the way (just around the point) will bring you to about 15 shopping huts. You will still have to haggle but they are less aggressive here. Take a bottle of water with you and take your time and the walk does not seem that far at all- hop in the ocean along the way. About walking around the resort, we found no flies or bugs that bothered us, but we did put bug lotion on our legs at night just in case. For excursions, we did the Bavaro runners and the Marinarium tour. Both were well worth the money, around $90 US per person. Bavaro Runners takes you through the country side, to a local school, sugarcane plantation, coffee plantation, cocoa plantation, tobacco plantation, horseback riding, and lunch at a ranch in the mountains. The Marinarium tour takes you out on a catamaran to swim with stingray and nurse sharks- very safe, you have a lite lunch on board, an open bar on board and a floating bar in the ocean. You take a cruise along the coastline and stop off shore for a dip. For those who don't wish to swim, you can stay on board and party with the entertaining tour guides- alot of fun!! There was some language barrier on the resort, mainly with the younger staff, while the older staff had very good English. Well dah, you are in a Spanish country, and that is to be expected. If they travelled here we would speak English to them wouldn't we...so no problem there for me. I found the staff to be very very friendly, but you always get what you put out. Lastly if you wish to cool off late at night, hop on the train and take a spin around the resort, it passes right along side the beach and the breeze is awesome. Go, enjoy the culture, enjoy the resort, enjoy the beauty, embrace the people, and you'll have a wonderful time.", "title": "Totally Awesome Trip", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "Culture-Shocked", "date": "May 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 29113029}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Just spent two weeks at bavaro resort, absolutely amazing, rooms, food, service, weather, everything just perfect, had our wedding 2nd week, carolina handled everything and the day was flawless, all staff are really friendly, cant do enough for you, will be back again next year.", "title": "IGNORE ANY NEGATIVES, THIS PLACE IS WONDERFULL", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "gj021", "date": "April 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28625343}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "Gary & Jennie, Birmingham", "title": "what more could one ask for?", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "applejacks6", "date": "April 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28519866}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Been back in the States for a week, and I miss the beautiful beach and weather sorely.

The beach was absolutely spectacular-of the several places we've stayed in the Caribbean, this was no doubt the prettiest. The staff kept the beach clean, and raked daily for seaweed (minimal). There were 1-2 foot waves which were perfect for the kids without being too rough. And this was after Hurricane Claudette had bypassed the island.

Yes, we all did experience stomach upset and diarrhea. We were not able to isolate what caused it but we think it was the presence of unflitered water in the environment-they are constantly irrigating the landscape and washing sidewalks with this foul-smelling water. We were extremely careful not to drink the tap water and used bottled-water exclusively. A few doses of Imodium took care of the problem-be sure to take some along. The biggest problem was the behavior of a few of the topless women. We knew toplessness was permitted when we booked the vacation. However, unfortunately, the resort needs to provide beach monitors to assure that toplessness doesn't mean sexual behavior. For some couples (mainly young Americans who perhaps have not been topless before) this was an invitation for inappropriate behavior in the ocean. This was very unsettling for our older daughters, and my husband and I on a few occasions had to ask the couples to respect that this is a family resort. I'd estimate that 60-70% of women on the beach were topless, and much smaller % at the pools. The only other disappointment was that snorkelling was an extra expense. We had to pay $20 per person to be taken out to the reel off-shore to snorkel. It was very good once we got there, but it would have been nice if there was eguipment available to borrow for the kids to use along the beach also. I guess next time we'll take our own from home.

It was like walking through a paradise! Unless you are an extremely uptight person, who doesn't know how to relax and needs absolute perfection, I strongly recommend this place. ( I can't believe some of the bad reviews I have read about this place!! SO NOT TRUE!!) There were 6 of us in our group aged 23-27. We only did one excursion called the party raft-you get to go snorkling and all the drinks were included for about $60. The guys on this boat were SOO much fun. They kind of reminded me of Jamaicans-so laid back and friendly! warning: Go EASY on the \"sex on the boat\" drinks they mix up after you are done snorkeling!!!! We got extremely intoxicated off of these and my boyfriend and I found ourselves throwing up later that night!! We found that being young AND American was definatley in the minority. We found out that the yellow bracelets were Americans who booked through Apple vacations, and the blue bracelets were from other countrys like Canada or Europe.

I have to say we were alittle scared about going after reading some of the reviews. Well guess what? Forget all the negative reviews, they'd probably complain about anyplace they went to. We (3 adults and 3 teenagers) had a great time!! The food was great at the buffets and the reservation restaurants. There was a great selection from different cultures including American, that you could always find something you liked. The rooms are your basic hotel rooms nothing special, but your not in them anyway. Yes, I'll agree about the pillows, but have a couple of drinks before bed and you won't care. The resort, grounds and beach are absolutely beautiful. You do need to get your towels on chairs at the pool early (around 8am) if you want a lounge chair at any point during the day (table and chairs always available). The beach lounge chairs only if you have a large party. Most of the buildings are not air conditioned and it's very humid there (at least in August) so dress accordingly. The reservation restaurants, the lobby bathrooms, the disco and your rooms are it. Either we got use to it or the humidity lifted the last half of our week. Remember again, your in the tropics. The staff is very friendly, but speaks little english, just enough to get by. Guest services personnel do speak english and some of the front desk people. I'd recommend learning a few phrases, but we got by on forgotten middle school spanish and only used the spanish/english dictionary once or twice. The activities/entertainment staff were wonderful, friendly and very active. They have activities for everyone - adults, children and the teenagers. The non-motorized water equipment was always available except the catamarans. You need to reserve them at 9am by the spa. Which brings me to the spa -- yum. I don't think they realize what they could be charging for they're services. When we go again - we decided we'll have something done everyday. It's sssooo cheap and feels great. Try a beach massage, the ocean breeze feels great. The shopping is kind of limited, there are shops near the lobbies of all 3 resorts. If you like to haggle there's a flea market area down the beach from the resort. Or if you cut thru there's alittle town with shops and the mercado is cheaper then the resort. And to the question everyone is wondering about - if you brush your teeth and rinse your toothbrush off with bottled water and don't drink any of the faucet or shower water - you should be fine and not have diarrhea. I had no problems - only a little upset because of all the fruit and rich food. Everyone else in our party did one of the no no's, like rinsing the toothbrush with the faucet water, but it didn't slow anyone down (bring the Immodium AD). Bottled water is available everywhere - it's your best friend embrace it. And here's my only complaint - European's are rude and smoke everywhere! That's it ! - I would return to Fiesta tomorrow if I could get off work and I truly hope to go back next year.
