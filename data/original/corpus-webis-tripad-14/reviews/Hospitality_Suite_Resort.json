Staff very friendly, housekeeping excellent, grounds immaculate. Jr. Suite is a deal with kitchenette. Kitchen and furniture dated and worn but clean. Hotel seems to cater to older European (mainly English) bus tour groups. This is not a place for younger crowd. It's just across the freeway from Tempe so you will not really be in Scottsdale proper. It is not a \"resort\" as we are now accustomed to but in its heyday it probably qualified. Three heated pools, one small, very hot jacuzzi, two tennis courts, free internet access in lobby, free cocktails poolside in evening, cooked American breakfast in restaurant (show up early, seating is limited). Noise from streets an issue, rooms in building B are quietest. Stay away from rooms that front roads. As with many older places, sound proofing minimal. Get upper rooms,they have elevators to access them. Ground floor rooms will hear amplified plumbing sounds from room above you. Biggest negative for me was the nighttime room temperature. The entire complex gets airconditioning OR heat, but NOT BOTH at the same time. While I was there a cold front with very strong winds came in. The nighttime temperatures dropped dramatically, as they can in the spring in the desert. Unable to get any heat in my room, front desk told me they would have maintenance fix it in the morning. They even went through the charade of filling out a maintenance order form. There is no \"fix\"--you get either AC or heat, not both. During spring when the nighttime temps can plummet the room can be quite cold. Housekeeping came with four blankets (synthetic and not very warm) which somewhat helped. After repeated requests to have someone look at my heater Front Desk finally came clean with why I had no heat. They said other guests were complaining that it was too hot and hotel had turned off the whole heating system. Duh, 40 degrees is a heat wave for Europeans but not us. They promised to turn the heat on at 9:00 p.m. Of course, this did not happen. Regardless of how accommodating and friendly front desk staff are, to not have been forthright that they had no intention to deliver heat to my room was a significant negative. I travel out of state on business several weeks a month and it drives me nuts when hotel staff respond to concerns with less than truthful answers.", "title": "Clean but be aware of room temp issues", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "silverjym", "date": "April 17, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3370239}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "This hotel is a great value for being this close to downtown Old Scottsdale.
