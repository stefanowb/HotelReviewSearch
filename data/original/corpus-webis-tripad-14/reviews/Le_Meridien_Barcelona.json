If I had to put makeup on everyday I could see that being a problem. The shower had drainage problems. Despite the fact that I speak Spanish and explained the problem to the staff twice, nothing was done to resolve the problem. I had to shower in a pool of water at my feet every night... and once I had been in the shower for more than five minutes... the water would flow into the main bathroom... not pretty. The workout facility was under construction while I was there, but passes were given out to a local gym. The local gym is very nice but was a nice ten to fifteen minute walk away from the hotel. I love my starwood points so I might consider staying here again, but otherwise, its just a nice hotel with a great location. Nothing really special about the hotel or the staff.

The room was large, comfortable and ultra-modern decor. The beds are huge by European standards and heavenly to sleep on. The only draw back was the lighting that seemed complicated and hard to figure out. The airconditioner was making noise at night so I had to turn it off so I could get some sleep. My advice is to always bring earplugs when you travel. Great shower and even has a TV in the bathroom. We used points to stay in this hotel for free but other than that is is probably around $500 a night. A real treat for us and a great way to enjoy our last day in Barcelona before returning home.
