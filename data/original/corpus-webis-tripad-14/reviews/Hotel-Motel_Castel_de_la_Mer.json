We were most definitely not disappointed! The room was very clean and a good size (with two Queen beds, a table and chairs, and a little balcony), the beds were very comfortable, and the staff at reception were extremely helpful in answering questions about the area. We opted for the least expensive 'standard' room, and were completely satisfied. Although this block of rooms faces the main road (route 362), which could be noisy from the balcony, the view of the bay was lovely and we did not find the noise bothersome at night. My only real complaint was that our supposed nonsmoking room had an ashtray in one of the drawers.
