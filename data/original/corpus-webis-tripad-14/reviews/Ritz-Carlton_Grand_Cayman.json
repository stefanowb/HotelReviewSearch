We stayed on the Club level and would HIGHLY recommend making the jump to Club. Ask for the special drink menu that they have (list of island drinks on a front and back sheet) and enjoy the awesome food available in the club room (Shrimp night was our favorite, they were some of the biggest we've ever seen!). The food, while expensive (but hey, everything in the Cayman's is relatively pricey), was outstanding overall - we ate at all the restaurants on site and had room service several times. And as people have mentioned, Blue is worth the jaw-dropping prices....One thing we were concerned about was all the reviews about children at the resort. To address this, yes there were a few kids running around but we weren't bothered in the least.

We were disappointed that everywhere people had badges from their corporate meetings, busses taking them on excursions etc.. Seemed more like Disney than a Ritz. In addition, as the other review pointed out, the beach was set up for many corporate events, again not what one would expect during a family time of year. The chair situation on the beach has also worsened as many get up as early as 7 as the reviewer pointed out and take lounge chairs with pails and shovels on them to save , only never to be used by the 3-7 year olds they save them for.The beach staff does try hard as does the restaurant staff. This year during the morning buffet which is pricey, the wait staff never asked to refill coffee or tea, etc and seemed completely overwhelmed with the number of guests and not as well trained as in previous years although they were always smiling and very friendly. as the other review pointed out 17-20 us dollars for a drink on the beach is a bit crazy and definitely not warranted. We too have travelled to no less than 5 star resorts and the one point that bothered us completely, there was no set price for a ritz kids meal plan for under 12, nor was there a ritz kids meal like the Ritz in Naples, or Key Biscayne meaning that a hot dog for 15 us dollars with tax and added gratuity was simply that a six inch hot dog with a few fries. Not the side order of something with the fruit cookie/ drink that the other Ritz resorts offer. With the price of the rooms etc, the resort should offer its youngest guests more than that! The golf and tennis instruction is wonderful.. and the island is clean and friendly.
