Last year we had a great time. The caravan was superb and the facilities in the club house were perfect for us including table tennis and darts. The location of the park is excellent with easy access to Herne Bay & Canterbury. This year we decided to upgrade to a Silver caravan with three beds as my wife's sons are 20 & 22 and need their space. Unfortunately the van was a let down. The carpet in the lounge was dirty and worn and due to being a three bed it felt smaller than last years van. On day one the shower broke, it was repaired the same day, but just showed the van was run down. In the club house the facilities have all changed and the only activity we could play as a family is Pool. We understand you can't please everyone, however for the type of break we were on with young adults, the table tennis and darts were a welcome recreation in the evening and as a family gave us an opportunity to have some fun with a couple of beers. As this couldn't happen we certainly spent less on site and instead walked down to the very nice pub (The Plough).", "user": "SamL2227GP", "date": "October 16, 2013", "id": 181297593}], "location": {}, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 9, "very good": 24, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 22}, "aka": "Seaview Holiday Park Hotel Swalecliffe", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "The park\u2019s facilities are centred around the main entertainment complex with our new venue now EVEN better for our holiday guests.
