Everything was in perfect/ working condition. The room was reasonably spacious, the bathroom was bigger than average and the outdoor shower was set in a small private garden setting. There's a recessed patio area out front that we shared with the adjacent 'cottage' and there's hammock in the closet that you can relax. I loved the hammock. The restaurant was delicious. I thought that the cocktails could have been a little stronger -- but we enjoyed the healthy and delicious cooking. There is a nice bar adjacent that we just glanced at, but that looks like a nice, polished place to kick back and hang out. There are trails to walk around and canoeing/ kayaking nearby but we did not have time for this.

They were mowing lawn both days we were there and it was LOUD. Very not relaxing. The BIG disappointment was the Spa. I paid for a full hour of some Mayan technique massage. The lady that I had was nice, but the massage did not feel good - I felt that the technique was lacking and the pressure was inconsistent. But I had no idea what I was in for later. The next morning at Chan Chich lodge, I got up early to go bird watching despite severe neck pain as a result of my massage and I had to let it go because I was unable to move my neck to look around with the binoculars. I have never before sustained such painful muscular injury that persists after a massage.
