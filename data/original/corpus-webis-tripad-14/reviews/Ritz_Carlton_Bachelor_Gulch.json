The decor is elegant but comfortable, and we always make sure we spend some time with the hotel mascot, Backelor the dog.

The hotel itself is a beautiful lodge. But I reserved a king bed way before our trip and they informed me they overbooked. It's not fair for someone who plans their trip. They gave us a room with 2 small double beds and took 50% off the bill. Okay, that helped, but we could not sleep together in such a small bed. Once in the room we wanted a drink, and in the room refrigerator all the orange juices had expired dates. Had to call to correct that. Then later in the evening, there was water leaking from somewhere and we had a wet carpet in a portion of the room we had to place a towel over. Had to call to correct that. The room coffee cups did not match and then finally, our in-room breakfast came without the room bill to sign. We've stayed at other 5-star resorts. This may sound fussy, but for a top-notch resort it was very disappointing in lack of attentiveness.", "user": "Ryan L", "date": "September 13, 2011", "id": 118093444}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfection...once again", "text": "I wrote the following letters to the Ritz Carlton in January/February 2011 and subsequently had a follow up interaction with Debi Howard at corporate headquarters.

When we returned we were told that rooms with King beds (which we were guaranteed to get) were very limited, they asked if we would take a room with a double bed, I would not and they put us in a room 2 floors below the lobby. I should have wondered about that room immediately since it was on the 2nd floor and we were supposed to have a room with a \"resort view\", but I decided to trust that they knew what they were doing, man was I wrong! Our \"view\" was 2 walls, tarps and paint buckets!! We went back up stairs to complain and when the clerk couldn't find another room for us he called over someone else and she pipped in that \"technically that IS a resort view\", I told her that was insulting and false advertisement, she asked if we would take a room with a double bed (again) and I said not, she put us in a room on the same floor with a mountain view (although she told us it was a \"resort view\" again, it was right next to the street so we got to listen to the cars drive by until late that night. At that point I was tired and hungry and didn't want to argue with them anymore so we stayed in that room and went out for dinner. The room itself was nice, clean and cozy, it's just not what we reserved and being insulted at check in made the whole experience a bad one. They had overbooked that weekend (seems to be a common problem here) and that was the issue with getting us what we reserved.", "user": "nalismom", "date": "October 1, 2011", "id": 118826592}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I want to go back so badly!", "text": "Bottom line is if you book here, be prepared to not receive what you book, lower your expectations and you will be fine :-)", "user": "Freddy B", "date": "September 29, 2011", "id": 118756317}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful Experience", "text": "We spent a mid-October weekend here and had a truly wonderful and remarkable time.
