I was a little worried about traveling to Jamaica, but from the time our driver met us at the airport to the time we left to go home I felt very safe and relaxed. The slow pace of life settled in quickly. You have to take a taxi to get to the beach, but really wasn't an issue for us. The 71/2 miles of perfect white beach and many restaurants to choose from made up for the short taxi ride. Hummm what else can I say but, LOVE YOU KIMI and can't wait to see you again very soon.

I mean my family doesnt always ask if there is anything I need or anytime I say, we would like to go here or there, they dont say \"no problem\" and then someone takes us immediately or picks us up when we call them to come get us for a small fee. Thats what you get when you stay here. Richard took us to the beach, to restaurants, to the market and gave advice and history. You feel safe from the minute you get here with the security guards too. The gardener keeps the grounds very nice and Cliff is always at the bar if you need something while you're hanging out at the awesome pool or huge hot tub. We stayed at 2B a 1 bedroom cottage and the grounds were perfect and the cottage was perfect for us.

She also arranged for a great captain to take us on a glass bottom boat snorkling trip. We stayed in villa 7 with another couple and we always felt that we had plenty of privacy. We had great access to the pool and bar which was great! Cliff, the bartender makes the best pi\u00f1a coladas and will make whatever he can for u! Richard is an angel! Always wanted us to have what we needed and never hesitated to take us wherever we needed to go! The groundskeeper,Shank Hi was always working hard to keep the grounds beautiful and always greeted you with a sincere smile. For an intimate customer service experience this is the place to stay! Although our villa was not on the beach side we had access to the water through the cave and the staff allowed us to access the beach from the 6 bdrm home on the beach side since it was vacant the week we were there. Beautiful water! As far as Negril goes we felt safe and enjoyed the food at many of the local restaurants. Be prepared to be approached multiple times to buy items if you are outside of the resort. Although it can get pricey taking a cab to certain places it is a must to avoid the hassle and to avoid the speeding cars on the narrow road. Overall we had a great visit!

The pictures on their website, while spectacular, don't do this place justice. The villas, gardens, and pool are gorgeous and tranquil. The seaside house is unreal. The cave and private cove are great places to relax and go for a swim. But Jamaica is about the people. The staff at Villas Sur Mer are the friendliest and most helpful hospitality staff we've ever met. Kimi is amazing and did everything she possibly could to make our time in Negril the best possible. Cliff, Richie, James, Marlon, Shankar, and all the cleaning staff are great people, and really make this place extra special. Great people to hang out with and to tell and listen to stories with. tJamaica is also about the food. The west side (cliff-side) of Negril has TONS of great places to eat. Great food can be found everywhere, from the \"hotel\" restaurants to the the road-side grills and shops. Villas Sur Mer and the cliffs are a great change of pace and scenery from the beaches of Negril, but close enough that you can hop into a cab (or shirtless on the back of Richard's moped, hugging him tight for all the girls to see) to hang out in the sands in the day or check out live reggae at night.

There are the most breath taking views off the cliffs. Across the street is the famous Ricks Cafe where I jumped off the 35 ft cliff....amazing! And there is another place called LTU.

We get regular massages and this took the massage to a whole new level. Others during our stay that were extraordinary were Donna, who kept our villa perfect and was available if we needed anything. And I loved Kimi, she and Elysia (sp?) hugged us into the resort and truly know the meaning of hospitality.

The AC, when needed, kept the entire villa cool. I was concerned about bugs since the windows were not screened, but whatever they use kept them away. Not even any ants in the kitchen. We loved and miss our little porch where we would sit with our homemade cocktails in the evening. The snorkeling cove was beautiful, unfortunately, my DH's hand brushed against some sea urchins so we did not get to enjoy much snorkeling while we were there. The cave path under the road to the cove was great. I do not like heights so it was an easy way for me to get down the cliff without being scared. Highly recommend this cliff location for people who have heights issues. Also, we did get to use the big house for an afternoon while they were between guests.

No pool bar available for all but the last afternoon we were there - we did ask multiple times upon arrival, I really wanted one of those nice rum punches I saw walking by, but it was always - \"be right back\". Then the next two days the bar by the pool was closed. We didn't die of thirst, we did have LTU pub right there and we had stopped and stocked the fridge. Richard deserted us on the beach (on the day of our 20th anniversary) and we had to scramble to get a cab and barely made our massages (hate being rushed and sweaty going to a massage), a simple \"I can't make it find your own ride\" would have been much better than saying I'll be there if you can't make it. Then the last day he was supposed to drive us to IA and again - no go, we paid the nice lady he arranged. I was really confused - was he supposed to be available for short local trips? Did we not tip him enough (not that we had much of an opportunity)? We gave up and took care of transportation ourselves for dinners on other nights. Not a huge deal, just tell us we have to take care of our own transportation so our expectations are set correctly. We know how to get around in Negril, this was not our first trip.
