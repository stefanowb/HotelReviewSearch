A nightmare, I would say. (We didn't choose the hotel, we were 'put there' by our host). The rooms are very small -- barely enough room to walk around the two double beds. Other than a chair and a desk, and the two beds, there's no other furniture. No closet. The washroom is small and the rubber nonslip mat provided was moldy. The carpet was very dirty -- after walking on it for several minutes wearing only white socks, the bottom of the socks turns black. It was our first experience returning to China, and it really shocked us. Later I found that the cleanliness in almost all hotels (including 5-star hotels) in China is problematic, so perhaps in retrospec this 3-star motel is \"not so bad\".", "title": "Awful", "user": "CanadianTraveller100", "date": "November 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 120848747}], "location": {"country": "China", "continent": "Asia"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 3, "very good": 16, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 0.344552196235}
