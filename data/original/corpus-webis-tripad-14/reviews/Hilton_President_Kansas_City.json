APPARENTLY, there was 1 room that they thought wasn't cleaned so they did not want to give it to us. but someone went upstairs to check and it was indeed clean and they gave it to us. What boggles my mind is, why the HECK aren't ALL the rooms CLEANED if they are telling us the hotel is booked for the weekend? what happened to our original reservation? and why in the WORLD do they even offer a CLOSET as a room?

The decor of the Drum Room, lobby, and rooms is classy, clean, and sophisticated. The option of self-parking is a nice perk as well. I do love valet service; however, their self-parking is on premises. I enjoy their location immensely, as they are within a five minute walk to the Sprint Center and the Power and Light District. The front desk employees are super courteous and professional. I am simply blown away.
