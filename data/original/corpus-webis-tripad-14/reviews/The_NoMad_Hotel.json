The NoMad is a different. We were moving from one apartment to another in NYC and decided the best treat we could give ourselves was a \"staycation\" in our own city, a place where we could relax in between the chaos of moving. The NoMad was so wonderful that it was hard to check out and actually move into our new apartment. We keep extending our stay. We booked the smaller suite, with a sublimely peaceful round bedroom and small but elegant sitting room. There was even a nice foyer, and the lavatory could be shut off from the main bathroom, adding privacy for true entertaining.", "title": "You Can Check in But You Will Never Want to Leave", "user": "psp7", "date": "July 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166039370}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The clawfoot bathtub with byob bath salts could not have made this mover any happier.

Park) you need look no farther. The hotel is, simply put: all you need. The rooms are awesomely designed and the space (small: this is NYC) is well distributed. The decoration is great. Toiletries are very nice. And the bathtub just by the writing desk is plain fun. On the down side you have a very noisy lobby and elevator entrance, and very dark common spaces. The Atrium (which is a NoMad hotel's restaurant) is to blame for the noise: it's very good and very a la mode, so people crowd in at dining hours. But this only affects you coming in or going out: a minute or two. Personnel is very professional but not entirely amiable. On all other issues everything was very good. Again, if you like to stay in this area, this is a great option: maybe the best one. And you are at walking distance from the other restaurant of Daniel Humm: the Eleven Madison Park.

The 168 rooms are residential in feel and decorated in his classic, timeless style. Each room is appointed with hand-selected, richly textured custom-designed furnishings and original artwork. The soaring ceilings throughout the public spaces provide a fine gathering place to enjoy dining, drinking and socializing."}
