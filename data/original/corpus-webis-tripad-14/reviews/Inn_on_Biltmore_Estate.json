From the time we arrived, we experienced amazing service. The accomodations were luxurious and so comfortable. We booked a Premier King room which is a little larger than their average room. When we arrived we were offered a mountain view room wheich was perfect. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the main dining room each day. It was delicious! Having unlimited access to the Biltmore Estate during our stay was a nice perk. My biggest complaint (and it's not that big at all) is that there was no where to sit and read a book outside and not be completely in the sun. The beautiful rocking chair porch is used for dining after 11 am. The reason for our trip was to celebrate my completion of radiation for breast cancer. The radiation has caused my skin to be extremely sensitive to the sun. I would have loved a shady place to be outside. But really, thats just a small complaint.
