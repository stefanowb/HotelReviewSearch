It's like a tardis on the inside though. Clearly the building has taken influences from the Victorian era, with very high ceilings, a huge wooden staircase and big wooden doors. Gonzalo and his wife have kept in keeping with the history of the building with very tastefully designed large rooms, with a touch of modernity with a definite German influence. There is a huge downstairs sitting room for guests, a lovely breakfast room and a garden area with sun deck. Upstairs, and just outside our very comfortable room, which had a sea view, there was a modern designed seating area.", "title": "Charming homestay in fabulous city", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tongi", "date": "November 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 186300318}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Our room was large, had a very comfortable bed and a bathroom with shower and thick towels.
