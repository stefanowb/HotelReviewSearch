Sadly the rooms are dreadful. The carpet in the 4th floor rooms is all water damaged and in urgent need of replacement. And the rooms need some pretty serious money spent on them. In fact, given that I just stayed in the Mercure Welcome Melbourne 2 weeks earlier I can safely say that all the Mercure hotels need some serious money spent on upgrading. The lobby of this hotel is quite nice but enter the rooms and be prepared to be shocked!!! And my advice is do not eat at the restaurant downstairs. We had a conference there earlier this month and it was just a rip off. Below average food and way too expensive. At least 10 of us had to send our meals back due to the sub standard nature of the meals. The bathrooms are all tired and the beds are hard as rocks. Our conference committee made the decision that our next Queenstown conference will be at non Mercure hotel (and something closer to town!). My advice: for the few xtra dollars you can do far far better and stay closer to town.", "title": "Warning - Do not stay here", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "chchsimon", "date": "June 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 7750031, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great value....great views", "text": "I ordered a steak sandwich and side vegetables from the bar.
