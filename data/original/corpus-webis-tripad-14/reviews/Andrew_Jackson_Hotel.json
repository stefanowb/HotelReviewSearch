Have been in a room with a queen sized bed and sofa, one with twin beds and one with 2 double beds. Some were newly painted, some needed a little work but none were dirtyThe rooms are not large and the furniture is miss matched. but staying in an older small hotel in the French Quarter I did not expect or want a cookie cutter modern room. Not every room has it's own air conditon control but all had a ceiling fan. Most of the bedrooms have been refurbished. Hopefully they will get around to the bathrooms but with shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, mouthwash and tissues provided, I didn't really have a problem with the decor. Yes if you walk around in the room without shoes your socks or feet will get black so bring a pair of slippers. The staff is fantastic always giving a hello and a smile. The doughnuts, bagels and cereal provided in the morning were fresh and tasty. The coffee hot and bitter the way it should be. The courtyard has limited seating but the guests were friendly and shared tables.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "FrugalTraveler50", "date": "July 21, 2004", "id": 2312210}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Would not recommend", "text": "We stayed for memorial weekend. Really the only benefit of this hotel is the courtyard and location. The courtyard is charming and authentic; the location is perfect in the french quarter. The hotel itself leaves much to be desired. Dirty and old. That's the only way I can describe it. We had a standard room that had just enough room for a bed.....but barely. Bathroom was falling apart. This place should be a museum....not somewhere to sleep. Didn't have a very pleasant odor either. The staff, however, was nice. There's better places to stay if you're traveling to new orleans.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 1, 2004", "id": 2139733}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "has its problems, but the front desk people were SO NICE!", "text": "I have to say that the Andrew Jackson hotel is quite charming, and the front-desk people were so helpful and friendly. Yes, the bathroom was run down, and the shower had absolutely no water pressure (just a trickle)...that is until we asked to have someone look at it. The next time I got in the shower, it was terrific! Also, I left some personal belongings behind last weekend, and I got themmailed back to me within a few days!!! The temperature was great for us (no control in the room was my only issue with that). The major problem I had with the place was with the carpeting. I could never walk in the room without shoes on. If they could improve the floor situation, I would recommend the hotel. Where else can you get such friendly service at such a good rate?", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 3, 2004", "id": 1854675}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Worst hotel ever", "text": "The one review that says the breakfast was hard donuts, lousy coffee, filthy rooms hit it right on the head here. This was my 20th anniversary and I was assured that this would be a great room overlooking the street. Room greeted us with beer can and cigarette butts on the balcony. Room was so filthy that I requested new sheets. Take off your shoes and the socks turned black INSTANTLY. The next morning painting and wallpapering took place.. called three times in advance never told about this. Did move to sister hotel which was slightly better, BUT only slightly. Shower terrible, bathroom door didn't close..the only relief we got from the room was when we left. Thank goodness New Orleans was great -this place is the worst!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 25, 2004", "id": 1835769}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "This hotel is good value", "text": "This hotel is placed in an excellent position to visit New Orleans.
