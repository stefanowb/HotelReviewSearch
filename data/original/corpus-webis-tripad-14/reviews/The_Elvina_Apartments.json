It was very peaceful, the staff were very helpful and the apartment to a high standard. The private transfers are worth teh money as it is a long journey from Dalaman and the water / sweets much appreciated! Kalkan is a short walk from Elvina (10 mins) but there is a bit of a hill so it wont suit everyone. The walk was well worth it to have such a great view.

The stunning location (albeit up a very steep hill) and the gorgeous split level apartments were everything we hoped for, and the view was to die for. By the end of the holiday we were managing the hills quite easily although we did resort to the odd taxi or two, especially when we were carrying shopping to cook in our very modern, extremely well equipped kitchen ( taxes were cheap and plentiful) The apartments were cleaned regularly, fresh linen/towels every few days and the main pool and bar area were spotless.

This is a heavenly place - I wake up each morning and sit outside watching the sun rise over the mountains to our left, looking out to sea and wondering how little I can do again today! Pool is superb, apartments are lovely if a little sparse - a coffee maker would be nice as would a tea pot. Beds are on the firm side. Come here if you want to relax and enjoy the views - Kalkan is a special place and we will be returning as soon as we can. Staff are lovely and the poolside is classy.

You can wake up in the double room to sweeping views of the bay and the town. Very adequately furnished apartment, Big fridge and freezer, washing machine, dishwasher, flat screen tv, dvd, satelite. Nice furnishings, 2 bathrooms (shower only) one upstairs and one down. A few basic things provided, (but take a couple of dishwasher tabs with you for convenience) salt, pepper and milk for your first day. I found the kitchen contained everything you could need with plenty of glasses, plates etc. But the nicest thing about the apartment is the great (semi-private) infinity pool accessed from the sizeable private terrace to the front of the living room (shared with just the the next door apartment) with stunning views and comfortable loungers. The terrace loses the sun at about 3-4pm and the balcony pool loses it about 4-5pm, but the communal terrace with huge communal pool and plenty of loungers keeps the sun until about 6-7pm. The views from everywhere are just breathtaking. You could of course pick minor faults with the apartments if you tried really hard, but I thought they were magnificent and can't see how anyone would not be totally overjoyed when they arrived.The hill to the aprtment is steep and taxis are quite expensive, but you are not too far from town and we walked to and from most places (including market and bus stop quite nearby by going left rather than down the hill from elvina) and back without too much problem. Although I could see this being a problem for some people so the taxi price of about \u00a33-4 e/w wold have to be taken into account. We paid \u00a3595/wk through turquoise collection for the apartment plus 250 deposit for damage, The same Tapestry package with flights transfers etc. seemed a little expensive and by doing the package ourselves we saved over \u00a3600 (we took buses rather than private transfers...very cheap). One negative, the few staff on-site are not that helpful and have no knowledge of the area at all, this opinion seemed to be shared by other guests who did luckily have lots of helpful advise on Kalkan, so that is your best bet. The on-site bar is reasonably priced, but we didn't try the food so can't comment. the six downstairs apartments have access to their own shared infinty pools from the balcony which are big pools. Each pair of apartments sharing one and the main shared pool is huge. this really is a fantastic apartment, I strongly reccommend it, you won't be disappointed.", "title": "Such a great place to relax and the views........wow!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "hatchs", "date": "September 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 39444045}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here for week 2 of our 3 week trip, with 2 young children.
