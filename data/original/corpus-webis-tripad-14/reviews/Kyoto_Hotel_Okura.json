I justed wanted to add the following points: 1. The hotel has two staff members with an office on the right side of the reception who are very professional to giving directions and any other information one might need: they provided us with a personalzed service explaining how to go the places we wanted to visit, and gave us detailed maps and lists indicating the local buses and correspondence, if necessary. This worked out very well. They sell day tickets for the bus (500 yen per day, very good deal) and other tickets (combined day metro and bus ticket), etc.. So, do not waste your time going to the tourist office in Kyoto station when arriving as recommended in most guide books, because you obtain the same and even more personal service at the hotel. 2. We had a triple room without breakfast. I don't know how much I exactly paid for the hotel itself because I booked a three night trip through an agency, including the Shinkansen from Tokyo, but overall it was acceptable compared to the standard of the hotel. We did not have meals, breakfast or used the room service or had dinner in one of the many restaurants of the hotel, because it was just too expensive (2100 yen for breakfast). We had breakfast in a small tea room that belongs to the hotel on floor (-2) where one can have a reasonable breakfast (coffee, tea, cappucino, one orange juice, a soup, and two croissants or other roll) for 650 yen. There are many good and reasonably priced restaurants nearby, and not located in the Pontocho street tourist trap, such as \"le Bouchon\" a French restaurant, two blocks away, looking a bit dull inside but excellent, and \"Kushikura\", a traditional japanese restaurant specialized in brochettes. 3. We booked a non-smoking room and obviously this room had been used as a smoking room by previous guests. The room literally stank of cigarette smoke, including the curtains, which is unacceptable in a hotel of such standard. We could not open the windows which means that the smell remained throughout or stay. I decided not to make a fuss of this because we had only a few days in the city and did not spend much time in the room. 4. Do not take a taxi or the metro to go to the station because the hotel has a free shuttle bus. At the arrival behind the station, they even came with us to guide us to the Shinkansen. To conclude, overall a positive experience, however, disappointed with the unacceptable non-smoking room policy, which was in total contradiction with the level of the other services provided. provided.", "title": "Excellent hotel but beware if you are a non-smoker", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mhphilemon", "date": "November 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 145972928}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Right across the street from Kyoto City Hall, the Hotel Okura\u00b4s location is excellent, walking distance to dozens of restaurants and shops (good options all along Kawaramachi Dori and also by the river).
