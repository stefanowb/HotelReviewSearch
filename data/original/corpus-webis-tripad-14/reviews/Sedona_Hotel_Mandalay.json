The rooms are a decent size, clean and the one I was in had a wonderful view of Mandalay fort. The hotel also has a nice pool, a good selection of generic restaurants (i.e. one Italian, one Asian, one coffee shop, etc.), an adequately equipped gym, and attentive staff. What this place lacks, is any sort of Burmese personality. In short, the Sedona could be any 4 star hotel located in any city anywhere in the world. If you wish to experience local color and to get a taste of the \"real\" Mandalay, you won't find it at the Sedona. If, however, you are looking for a clean, safe place to cocoon yourself after a day of exploring, then this is probably the best place in town.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "Rabidpuppy", "date": "September 21, 2004", "id": 2588998}], "location": {"country": "Myanmar", "region": "Mandalay Region", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Mandalay"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 43, "very good": 85, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 31}, "aka": "Mandalay Sedona Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.170731707317}
