We were overjoyed. We got a huge private pool, Flat screen TV in bathroom, Welcome Fruits and Drink and a free 30 minute massage at the Spa. Only problem is the distance, which was about 30 minutes walk from the Kuta centre. We mostly used taxi but you need to negotiate properly before stepping in. We would recommend this hotel to honeymooners who just want to laze and relax in the hotel area.", "title": "Very memorable", "user": "Bumplin", "date": "September 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 20109578, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The ROOm", "disliked": "\u2014 Location"}}], "location": {"country": "Indonesia", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Tuban"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 52, "very good": 233, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 235}, "aka": "Rama Beach Resort And Villas Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0588235294118, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}}
