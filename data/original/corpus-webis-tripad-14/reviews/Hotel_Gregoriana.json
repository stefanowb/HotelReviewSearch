Very clean room and bath, and breakfast (average, but large) is brought to your door. Daytime guy, Aldo, is great, and will help with anything you need. Nighttime guy often not at desk. Try NOT to get a room facing the street when you reserve. Security is OK due to good location, but the Spanish Steps on Saturday night are EXTREMELY NOISY. I could not sleep that night. Try to get room facing elsewhere. Otherwise, it's fine for the money and location.

Why, when some of the rooms are small, the breakfast is oooookaaaay (but hey, its included and delivered to your room) and the smoking thing? Because Aldo, Marcello and co make you feel so safe, comfortable and cared for in a big city. The location is unbelievable, in the thick of things but quiet and the rates are even more unbelievable for Rome. The new decor is really charming (art deco, simply and stylish) the towels are excellent (there are towel warmers too), beds are comfy, linen crisp, there is CNN, and Aldo really knows Rome.

We arrived early in the morning on April 26th. The hotel kept our bags and gave us breakfast until our room was ready a few hours later. Breakfast consisted of a basket of rolls, crussants, and cookies with different spreads. Coffee, tea, juice. We also saw someone eatting an egg one morning, so I guess you can request that too. Aldo and Sandro were very nice and helped us out with any questions we had. The hotel is 4 or 5 floors I believe. There is an elevator, but it is small. We had a room facing the street. It was very quiet even though it was 1 block from the top of the Spanish Steps. I loved how you could open the shutters and take in some of Rome. The bathroom was complete with a shower tub, however the glass only covered part of the shower, so we got water on the floor a couple of times. There is a hairdryer in the room, although not that great. Aldo let me borrow a converter to use because for some reason mine wouldn't work. The bed was comfy and the room had a small flat pannel tv.

The hotel has been recently refurbished: the single room I had had a parquetry floor, a comfortable bed with a beautiful parquetry bedhead and lovely pictures on the wall - all connected to a kind of 1940's-1950's retro kind of theme, and all immaculately clean and even pretty. Beautiful heavy fabric curtains - and a window that looked out onto the street. Via Gregoriana is a small street that is one of two that leads away from the top of the Spanish Steps; the other one has one of those hugely expensive, swanky hotels. This street has no other hotels at all and, thus, at night there is virtually no noise at all; I did not hear another noise at night from other guests, either - and, so, if you want to stay in a place where people are quietly well-heeled without being painful or inconsiderate, this place will suit. Breakfast is not a great event - a little basket of pastries, toast with condiments, etc. and coffee/tea but, in a sense, the whole of Rome is 5 minutes walk away and, so, if you want something else, you can go and get it. But for peace and quiet, cleanliness, friendliness and price - this is a great little hotel. I will happily return there for my next trip to Rome.
