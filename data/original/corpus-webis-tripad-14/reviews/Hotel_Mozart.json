Hotel Mozart is situated 15 minutes from the Trevi Fountain, 5 minutes from the Spanish Steps, another five in the opposite direction is Piazza Popolo, 20 minutes away the Pantheon, 30 the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Rooms were a good size, clean, great beds, brand-new marble bathrooms, better than we expected from a 3 star hotel. Another plus: the hotel offers a hearty breakfast not only the traditional cakes and pastries with coffee. We were given some great recommendations for dinner from the gentlemen working at the front desk, especially Claudio who sent us to a very nice tratoria in Trastevere. As one reviewer has mentioned, cars can not pull up in front of the hotel, but the walk from the main street Via del Corso, is less than a minute, and we never had to carry our bags, the bell-boy was always helpful and courteous. The taxi stand is 5 minutes from the hotel, and the closest bus stop only 2 minutes on Via del Corso. We had a great vacation in Rome and we look forward to coming back one day and staying at the Mozart again.
