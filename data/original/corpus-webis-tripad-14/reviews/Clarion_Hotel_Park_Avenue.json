It was by far the best deal around at $161/night for a room with one double bed. Most other hotels were charging double that price. We typically like to stay in Murray Hill, Gramercy, Kip's Bay, because it's convenient to Penn Station, the 6 subway train, and easy access to the Village and Midtown. The Clarion, while pretty much average in every way did the job despite it being one of the smallest hotel rooms we've ever had outside of traveling in Europe. However, the room was fairly clean and updated and they managed to pack a lot of amenities into such a tiny space. The best feature was the large flat-screen tv in the room. We could pull it out and lay on the bed and it was almost at our feet. The bathroom was updated though it had one of the smallest tubs that I had ever seen. We didn't have any view, except of a fire escape between two buildings that was covered in pigeon dirt. However, we enjoyed the short stay there and the staff was courteous.
