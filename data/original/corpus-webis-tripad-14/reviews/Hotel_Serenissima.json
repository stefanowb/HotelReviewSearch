The staff were so friendly, welcoming and they could not do enough for us. The owner (Marie) was just divine and like a typical mother to people in the hotel hence the reason why we nicknamed her \"Mama Italia\". The rooms were so cosy and gave a real Italian feel to them. Breakfast was so tasty even serving heated rolls and croissants along with jams, cheeses, juices, tea, coffee or hot chocolate. Nothing was a problem for them. The staff were also extremely helpful with advice on places to go and where not to go which was a real help as it was our first time there. The hotel was right in the centre of all the attractions. The Rialto seems to be the place to go. We were minutes from Saint Marcs Square and minutes from the cafes, shops and restaurants. Overall i would recommend for anyone to stay in this hotel.

The room was slightly bigger than we had anticipated, after reading some of the previous reviews. If you find that your air cond is not working,just check with reception, because ours had been turned off. It is very stuffy without it. The breakfast was the most basic we have ever had on a holiday, and whatever you do , dont order tea at breakfast. The minute we arrived at the airport , we were parted from nearly 80 euros for public transport and bus passes. This proved to be the way it was for the whole break . Dont be under the illusion that you can do this trip on the cheap,because you cant. We paid generally 10 euros for 2 small beers, and in one restaurant ( AL BURCHIELLO) we paid 50 euros for 2 plain pizzas and 2 beers. The beers were 9 euros each and they took 12% and 5 euros service charges on top. Scandalous! The biggest dissapointment was the attitude of the people that we encountered, working in Venice ie. waiters etc . Niceties and good manners do not exist. We appreciate that a lot of the big cities are this way, but we found Venice to be in a class of its own. We did visit the Lido, ( 15 mins on the water bus ) and we found it a great relief from the hustle bustle of the main areas. I think that we would agree with some of the previous reviews, in that in the future we would stop there , away from the madding crowd.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "davejames", "date": "June 19, 2007", "id": 7938380}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled solo", "text": "Venice is a place unlike anywhere else, and everyone should visit once.
