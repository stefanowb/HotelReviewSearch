The location is great - walkable to the Port Arthur historic site, and the Tasman Island cruise HQ is just next to the main entrance. The grocery store is also just up the road. We requested a water view cabin and they were able to accomodate us, even though we only booked a week in advance. The quiet Stewart's Bay is beautiful, with walking tracks all along the property leading to the small secluded beach. DVDs are available from reception, as is internet access.
