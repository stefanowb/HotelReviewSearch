The hotel has a nice location, reasonable prices and delivers good bedding, tv, showers, and morning continental breakfast. Room size is fine and we stayed in a room with two double beds with two teenage boys. Good place to call base camp for a weekend in Newport. The cliff walk is close by, as are the mansions, but as an advisor wrote probably a bit more of a walk than most are willing to take. Of course free parking so you can easily drive into the Newport action and walk around. Good place to stay if you're looking to shave a few bucks off a Newport stay and it's clean, with all the amenities you'd expect. Plus the free breakfast to take the edge off the family in the morning.", "title": "Great stay, exactly what was expected", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kbell", "date": "May 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 16432138, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Loacted right where we needed to be", "disliked": "\u2014 Noise"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "First off, the main floor (floor 1) is actually the 2nd floor as this hotel is elevated and parking is located underneath. We checked in (which went smoothly) but we arrived at our room to find a single king sized bed when we had requested two double beds. We went down to the front desk and the woman was understanding and helpful. She was on the job less than a month and had trouble switching our rooms (the hotel was full that weekend). She thought there was another room but couldn't get the computer to cooperate. She let us know that a more experienced woman would be at work in an hour and to try then.
