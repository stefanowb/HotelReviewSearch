Eventually I was upgraded to a much larger non-smoking room. Although this process took a long time and was not the smoothest, the staff did their best and were eventually able to resolve the matter. The hotel staff are all well trained and polite. They were very helpful with good restuarant recommendations and helped us find a nice hole in the wall place for hot pot. Thanks to them, it was easy to get a cab and find my way around the city. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I used the gym one morning and found that facility ample and nice. The breakfast buffet is also a nice start to the day.
