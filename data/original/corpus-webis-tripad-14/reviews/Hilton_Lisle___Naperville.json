After a hard day in the office I got back to find my bedroom had not been cleaned. I phoned housekeeping who came within a hairsbreadth of accusing me of lying when I said I had not put the \"Do not Disturb sign on the door, and then asked me whether I really wanted my room cleaned at this time of the evening.
