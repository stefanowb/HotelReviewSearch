No views as such since fence doors opened onto roof of spa below but nice sunken garden restaurant and lovely air-conditioned bar. Small pool with jacuzzi and steam room which we had all to ourselves and a small gym that we were far too chilled to use! Room service prompt and well stocked mini-bar with red and white wine and champagne. Staff extremely helpful with iced juice on arrival. Taxis arrived in a minute although most places very walkable.
