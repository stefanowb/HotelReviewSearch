Stayed for one night in a King room after attending a wedding in the area. We chose the room for it's convenient location and low price. (About 115 dollars including breakfast - which great for Portland) The hotel itself was nice enough - nothing fancy but modern, clean, and comfortable. Very close to the airport, which is good for travellers. Front-desk staff was efficient but not very friendly. The only really bad part of our stay was the breakfast. We arrived downstairs about 45-50 minutes before breakfast was supposed to be over, only to find very little food left. What was there was cold and unappetizing. We had already paid for the breakfast (booked through the hotel and paid extra for the it) so we went ahead and ate what we could scrape up. There was one bottle of ketchup for all the guests to share, unfortunately by the time it made it's way to us it was pretty much empty. There was no coffee left and I tried to flag down the one staff person that was flitting about the place, but to no avail. Also, it wasn't a proper restaurant, but just an area off to one side of the lobby. It felt strange sitting there and eating while people breezed in and out with suitcases. I did email the hotel once we returned home and complained about the situation, and was immediately (same day?) sent an apology from the manager, who also refunded the money paid for breakfast. I was impressed by this prompt attention to our problem, and therefore I would stay again. I'll just grab breakfast at Starbucks instead.", "title": "Great price, good room, fair service, bad breakfast", "user": "branmart", "date": "December 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 11939002, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and price", "disliked": "\u2014 Breakfast and service"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007", "text": "The lobby is very attractive, the staff friendly, but my room felt rather cheap.
