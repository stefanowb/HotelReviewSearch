My expectations were high and I was not disappointed. Furthermore, I was impressed by the quality of the service and the room. We have been welcomed by the owner who was particularly helpful, caring and friendly. The room was clean and cozy. The breakfast served at room without extra charge was a great start of the day. There are plenty of nice walks and falls to see from there. It is walking distance from the train station.

Admittedly the weather was miserable, but we didn\u2019t have a great time here. The Hotel was okay, just not as nice as what we were expecting. It was lacking an atmosphere. Well that\u2019s what we put it down to. My wife and I are sports mad & there were no cable channels to watch. We thought everybody had cable TV these days. The room was modest and the bathroom was a bit dated. Also, the room was very damp so there was a bad smell. You could hear the people in the adjacent rooms on both sides of us most of the night. Not sure if this is because of the walls or if they were really loud. If you are expecting a lot then this is not the place for you.
