It is very close to the train station and has a very nice interior. The rooms are among the nicest I've seen in my travels and very roomy by Italian hotel standards. It is well within walking distance of anything you want to see but is on the outer rim of historic florence. The thing that will keep me from returning is the service. I was spoiled in Rome by a hotel staffed with friendly people who greeted me in the morning, shook my hand, helped me arrange things as a matter of good service, and actually seemed happy to have me in their hotel. From the moment I entered the door, the staff at the Hotel Adler Cavalieri were cold to indifferent. They were professional but I can find professionalism in almost any hotel of that level. I was frankly disappointed in the service. As an example, I would expect for the price they charge per night that the desk personnel would be able to help me obtain a reservation at the Academia simply as a matter of good service. It was not until I actually reached the Academia that I learned they had charged me an additional 4 Euro per ticket simply for making a 30 second phone call to secure us a reservation. He did not even have the decency to inform us there would be an extra charge. It is the principle more than the extra 8 Euro that bothered me. If you're looking for service, look elsewhere because you won't find it at the Hotel Adler Cavalieri.", "title": "Will not return", "user": "P3FlightDoc", "date": "September 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8738040, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Large clean room", "disliked": "\u2014 Poor service"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Average hotel in Florence", "text": "Stayed at this hotel for three nights after seeing the excellent reviews on tripadvisor and therefore having high expectations.

We were able to make ourselves understood with our limited Italian quite well. The Adler Cavalieri is located on a fairly busy street, but it was quiet at night in our room.
