Having arrived prior to the check in time the proprietor was more than happy to provide maps and suggestions and even allowed us to use two of their bicycles to explore Takayama free of charge which is highly recommended. Upon our return our bags were stored in our small room which did however contain it's own sink and toilet. The kaiseki dinner was good and enjoyed with the other guests in a dining hall, as to was the breakfast. There is also a small public bath downstairs which was great after a day bike riding! The only criticism is the smoke. Smoking is allowed through the ryokan and even though we were in a non-smoking room, by the morning our room reeked from all the smoke rising into our room on the first floor. Great service however and the owner even dropped us off a the station the next morning.", "title": "A good mid-price Ryokan experience", "user": "Steee009", "date": "June 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 31541699}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed 2 nights at Yamakyu and we had a great time in there.

Takayama is a beautiful town - and this inn was just the type of place we wanted to stay. It's traditional - so you sleep on tatami mats and although we had a sink and toilet, did not have our own shower/bath (so we used the baths). As an American who is used to some privacy while bathing, I was not sure how I would handle this - but it was completely fine and I never saw another person, anyway (by the way - these are single sex baths). The baths feel great, too - was such a treat at the end (and start) of the day! The inn is very sweet and quirky, as far as decoration (there is also a lovely garden within the hotel - our room looked out onto it), and the food is fantastic - amazing kaiseki meals that just went on and on and on (we ate both dinner and breakfast there)! They also offered free internet access (in the sitting area), which was nice. The location was great, too - right near a shrine and about five minutes walk from the center of town.
