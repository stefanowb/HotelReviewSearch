The front desk manager Steve Bruce is as welcoming as a long lost father. The bottles of water and a cookie are an unexpected and nice touch. Dinner could not be easier, the chef, Milton will gladly come out of the open kitchen and pretty much make whatever you want (providing he has the ingredients!). The drinks are very reasonable, the service is friendly and unobtrusive yet they do not ignore you. We ate outside one night and it was wonderful. We love this hotel, it is a real gem in a sea of mediocre hotels in Las Vegas.

Our first night was ruined by the couple next door who left the TV blasting while not even being in the room. When they returned at 1 am, he, retching down the hallway, continued to a profanity-laden argument with his partner in the room (at least the TV is off now) for the next half hour. Needless to say, between the TV and his drunken tirade, we got very little sleep. Lauren at the desk moved us to another room later that morning, apologizing for our restless night. The new room was a one-bedroom suite and was very quiet.

Our 5 year old rode back to the hotel with another family to watch TV. The father went to the front desk with our 5 year old and was able to get a room key. He did not show any ID and the hotel never called us to see if it was okay for him to have a key. If they would have checked his ID they would have realized the name was different than the room. The hotel backed up their decision because they said out 5 year old knew the name and room number. The hotel did not know this gentleman from adam and honestly this could have been any little girl. Our 5 year old got her swim suit and went swimming, which we were never asked or would have approved without one of her parents being present. The hotel stated they are trying to make our 5 year old happy. I guess they are not concerned with keeping paying parents happy. I would be very careful of this facility as well as the Hampton Inn and Holiday Inn in Henderson. The hotel offered to give us future stays to make up for it. Sorry, not really trusting any of the facilities since they give out room keys without checking identification. I am furious that the hotel feels it is okay to release a room key without identification to a man with a little girl. If I would have wanted our 5 year old to go swimming, I would have given her a key to the room.
