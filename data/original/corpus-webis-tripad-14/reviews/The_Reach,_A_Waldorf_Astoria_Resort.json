Small pool, only 1 restaurant and no other options for drinks or food/snacks. Pool table and activities right in midddle of restaurant and bar area with lots of area to expand so not sure why they crammed everything into a porch. The pool staff was great. DJ got us set up most everyday. Wait staff had to work pool/beach and restaurant did not make a lot of sense to do it that way. It resulted in a warm $15 mojito. You could always get a table at the restaurant so I think we were not alone in our assesment. Strip House \"Easter\" was good but the service made the evening spectacular,Luther was one of the best I have ever had he was oen of the highlights of the hotel.

The location and overall appeal is perfect. Sitting on it's own corner of the Key West world, they have their own sand beach as well as a fantastic pool and lounging area.

Unfortunately, there was furniture missing, and the place was pretty dirty. Not dust, but more like food stuck in the furniture dirty. We discussed the furniture issue with the front desk and they indicated that they would locate a dresser for the bedroom (there was only a bed and two nightstands in the room in order to accommodate a wheelchair).
