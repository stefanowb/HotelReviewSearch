They are, indeed, spectacular. However, there is a somewhat crude expression in the North of England contrasting extravagant dress with an absence of underwear. The metaphor is very applicable here. A great deal of imagination and no small expense has gone into re-creating a palace on the top of a hill and filling it with artefacts garnered from elsewhere to create an imposing environment. But the result is uncomfortable in several aspects. Access is poor. From the dropping off point, guests have to tackle a steep slope to reach reception and, once inside - though there is a lift between the accommodation floors - everywhere else is accessed by stairs and flights of steps, some of them lengthy and steep. For some reason, the interior dining room is reserved for functions; thus requiring a guests to negotiate steps and a courtyard to reach another building (served with external kitchens) in order to eat.", "title": "Misplaced Priorities", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NatGreen", "date": "March 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 154296168}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Since we have a special interest in disabled access, we enquired about this and were shown a vehicle route around the hotel which would enable a wheelchair user to reach a point at which they would be able to use a paved way and, with the use of a portable ramp, reach the ground floor.

A confection of bulbous domes, sugar-white pillars, crenellations, and intricate jali screens, it escapes the kitschy through its graceful proportions and airy reception areas, courtyard, and verandas\u2014all of which are graced with antiques and delicate frescoes inspired by the style of Rajput miniatures.
