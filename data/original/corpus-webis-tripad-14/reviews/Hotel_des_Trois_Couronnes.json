This was the most expensive hotel we stayed in during our trip, but it lived up to every expectation. The location on Lake Geneva is ideal, and the hotel makes the most of this with an outside terrace on the second floor with a fantastic restaurant as well as a sun deck. There is also a spa and an indoor pool just under the deck. The rooms were beautifully decorated with modern bathrooms. I would love to give this hotel 10 stars, but could not honestly give it the 5 star rating, because we were extremely surprised and disappointed to find out on our arrival that the hotel is not air conditioned. Every night we looked out at the beautiful view over the lake as we struggled to sleep in the hot and humid room.

We had not expected this as the hotel website made no mention of the noise that was to be endured by guests in these rooms.A trolley bus passed by every few minutes, cars with screeching horns and a clock tower with bells that chimed ALL through the night. On top of this the room was insufferably hot - the hotel has no air conditioning. There were no shutters and the windows had to be kept open to get any air. After half an hour in this room I had had enough! I went to reception and enquired about the possibility of a quieter room.We were told we could change rooms the following day and were offered one of the hotel's portable air conditioning units to make the room temperature more tolerable. This did help quite a lot. NOTE: these units are not advertised so now you know!! This first bedroom was large and well equipped with a good bathroom - plenty of Molton Brown toiletries etc. The folowing day we moved to our quieter room. This had a side lake view and small balcony which was nice. It was quieter too but sadly we lost the air con unit - didn't feel I could ask for any thing else so we put up with the heat for the next 4 nights.Cold wet flannels got us through the night - not really what you expect from a 5* hotel. This second bedroom had a much inferior bathroom with old looking brown tiles and the narrowest bath I have ever come across in the world. Kate Moss may fit in it but we didn't !! There was a detachable shower head on the wall but no shower guard or even a curtain. The floor got wet even being very careful.Most definitely not a 5 * bathroom. The rest of the hotel was lovely - nice terrace and indoor sitting areas.We were offered fresh orange or fizz when we arrived which was nice. The restaurant was excellent for breakfast and an interesting experience in the evening.An evening meal typically took around 2 hours. On holiday you are not in a rush but this was too much .One evening we were still eating in pitch dark with 2 small candles - it was light when we arrived.Very French menu and ambiance ( frogs legs, rabbit terrine and veal sweetbreads as starters.) All beautifully presented. Vevey is lovely and a great base for rail and boat trips. We would only recommend this hotel if you are rich enough to afford one of the lake view rooms and don't mind heat at night. Incidentally neither of us thought that this hotel was anywhere near as good as the next hotel we stayed in at Zermatt. Bit miffed that we had informed the hotel that it was our wedding anniversary- had hoped for something - bottle of wine in room maybe.
