The room we checked into had a bad smell coming from the restroom. We informed the front desk as we left for dinner and they had a new room ready for us when we returned. Since they quickly solved the problem we didn't think twice about it. The location isn't exactly ideal for restaurants or nightlife, but is only a couple of miles out of downtown. We highly recommend eating mexican at Pappasito's and beers at Humperdink's. Both of these places are just a few miles north of the hotel on Stemmons Freeway. Overall the hotel looked pretty new and the rooms were nice. We would consider staying here again if the price was right compared to downtown hotels.", "title": "Above average hotel", "user": "Easy180", "date": "November 19, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4127702}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005, traveled on business", "text": "After reading the reviews, I was notably wary as a female business guest travelling alone.

In fact there is not much around it, certainly nothing within walking distance. The first night we hoped to get something to eat but found the restaurant was closing at 9 though it was a Friday night. The woman at the front desk said she would ask the staff to keep it open a couple of minutes so we could order. We brought our stuff to the room and then went to the restaurant where the manager curtly told us that they were no longer serving food, that it did not matter what the woman at the front desk said, and then turned his back on us and left. The woman at the desk could provide little other information on restaurants in the area so we ended up driving around for an hour till we found something. The hotel itself was bland and looked a little soiled. Temperatures inside seemed to be in the 60's. The room was adequate but not more. There is an athletic center and business center and the tiniest outdoor pool you will probably ever see. There is plenty of parking and the highway is easy to reach. It is an ok place to stay. It is not nightmarish.
