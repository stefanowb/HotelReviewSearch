Traditional in style but looked like it had recently had a makeover. I was impressed that access to public areas and particularly the bedrooms had taken account for less able bodied guests, wide doors, lift and the en suite bathroom had hand rails and a seat in the shower. Bedrooms are large with comfortable beds and plenty of soft towels. Very small tv but compensated with free wifi. Nice bar area with open fire and plenty of seating. Continental breakfast with all the usual suspects, good start to the day. We only had the one night here but would have been happy to stay for longer if we hadn't already booked a week in Chamonix.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "SL.123", "date": "March 29, 2013", "id": 156010824}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Overall, impressed.", "title": "charming idiosyncratic hotel -- great family rooms", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Lalehamlodge", "date": "March 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 156001062}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "This is a pleasant family-run hotel with interesting decor, super suites for families, and very welcoming staff. Some things may not work as smoothly as you might want (see other complaining reviews) -- in our case there were several blown light bulbs in our room and a wonky door handle. But for goodness sake you're in Italy for the warmth of the people, the joie de vivre, the mountains, the food. If you want a super-efficient holiday where everything in the hotel runs like clockwork, please holiday in Germany.

The girl behind the bar taught me some Italian whilst serving me a Campari, and I taught her some English.
