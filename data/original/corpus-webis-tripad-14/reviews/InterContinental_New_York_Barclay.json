So I stayed at the Barclay from March 24 to 27th. Paid 249 USD for the first two nights and 349 USD for the last night. At the time of booking the agent at the 1-800 IC number asked if I was celebrating a special occaision. I said that we were celebrating our ten-year anniversary. We booked a King Bed Superior and what was called the luxury escape package. The IC agent said that the hotel would \"definitely do something special to honour our anniversary\". I was not expecting anything spectacular however since they suggested it I was kind of looking forward to the gesture. What a let down upon arrival. No attendants available to help carry in the luggage from the taxi. Upon check in we discovered that we had been assigned a single room with only a double bed! I immediately went down to see Jose at the front desk and explained that there had been an error. Jose said that there was nothing he could do. I showed him my confirmation printout via email for a King Bed Superior. Jose smiled and said he could upgrade me to a suite for an additional $150 USD per night! He then alternatively offered me a smoking room. When i said that this was not acceptable he lowered the price of said suite to an additional 100 USD per night. I knew that he was not offering any solution so I asked to speak to the manager. Mr. Jansens the manager on duty arrived and I explained the situation. The manager was totally indifferent. He did not apologize for the mistake nor did he even bother to wish me congratulations on ten years of marriage. What a dissappointment. After further requests he finally put me in the king bed superior room that jose told me was not available. Take my advice and do not stay at this hotel. First impression is everything. Any hotel of merit must be able to admit its mistakes and take care of the customer. Ultimately the problem was resolved however there was no excuse for the utter lack of attention and customer service. This would never have happened in hotel that truly values its guests.
