The apartments have been redone into nice modern \"hotel\" rooms with modern nice bathrooms. You will not believe how new and modern and nice it is from the outside of the old building. It is a fair walk from the old town down a rather dark street which might give single women or older travelers a bit of concern, but we never encountered any problem. The staff could not have been more helpful. We were catching the night train on the day we left and they let us use the common areas until our train left. We arrived on a night train and they expected us to go right there and have a free breakfast and leave our luggage. I did not expect that and we decided to go right on an Aushwicz tour that day. The staff waited in vain for three hours for us and even tried to call our house in the states to see what had happened to us. The only word of caution I would give is that there is not an elevator and it is a hard climb up five or six flights of stairs with your luggage. Krakow is an excellent city to visit. We took a walking tour of the old city which was excellent. We also took a \"golf car tour\" (you will know what I mean when you see them) of the old Jewish area. This was a very good choice for the money because the old Jewish area involves a lot of walking.", "title": "Nice modern guest house", "user": "Robbed_John", "date": "September 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 44560445}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Warm welcome on arrival and throughout.
