We did not want to spend a ton of money but we did not want to stay in hostel either. This hotels location is AWESOME!!! Very safe and quiet as well. So close to the best shoping in London and minutes from the Marble Arch tube station which is very convenient as well. If you are travelling on the tube for more than 5 days get a 7 day travel card (oyster card), much cheaper and convenient to swipe in and out. The hotel staff were very, very friendly and our room was ready when we checked in early (noon). Be ware of having to carry heavy suitecases up lots of flights of stairs if you are on a high floor as they do not have elevators. Pros of the room: decent size for London, coffee and tea maker, bed was OK, room was quiet. Cons: carpet is old and needs cleaning (bring flip flops or slippers, flip flops for sure if you have a shared shower room). The bedding could use upgrading, pretty shabby.

Nonetheless for the equivalent of nearly $200 we expected that it would meet a certain standard of comfort. Arriving late in the evening after a long journey, we were quite discouraged to find that while the room (room 1A) did have a shower as promised, the shower was a stand-alone unit installed into the bookcase next to the bed. I'm as lazy as the next guy but I really do prefer to have my shower in the bathroom. Call me crazy. We might have been inclined to describe this as merely quirky but the ripped sheets covering the plastic cover on the matters, the general dinginess of the room and the hostel-like environment that kept us awake most of the night was enough to send us running the next morning. We gladly put down the extra \u00a325 to stay around the corner at the Cumberland. For our money, we easily doubled or tripled our comfort. $200 may seem like a lot for a room, but until you've spent a night in the Edward Lear, you'll never understand just how little it really buys you.
