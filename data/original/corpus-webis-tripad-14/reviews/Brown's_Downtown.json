The hi tech issue, a mac computer and ipad, makes an impression, however they are not very useful, people who need a computer always bring their own. The bathroom is rather small, but spacious enough, and the shower in marble blocks is stunning, also very functional. Few small improvements can be made: A small selection of teabags next to the water boiler would be nice. Some of the artsy bits could be replaced with more functional stuff.

We actually made a joke out of whether it would be cleaned when we returned every evening. The second is that the pocket door to the bathroom didn't work properly. It appeared that the shower stall may have previously leaked and warped the wood. Finally, we had a flight change resulting in a very early departure. We arranged and prepaid for a taxi with reception the day prior to departure. As we were waiting the next morning, the over night person realized that the taxi was never reserved.
