We needed to take a well earned break away from the work and stress of the city- and were looking to be active and lose a few accumulated kilos as well. The lovely hilly location with walks down to (and back up) from the long beach was a perfect way to start the day. Even better was the highly informative tour of the coconut plantation with tastings included. Yum! Thanks to Carl we learned about the health and weight benefits of coconut.Carl was most accomodating in assisting guests to de-husk their own coconuts. Not so difficult when you know how! After the tour which the whole group appeared to enjoy immensly we were promptly delivered a supply of husked coconuts to our room- these were perfect to take with us on the road for our drive to the Mossman Gorge- as the coconut water is the perfect re-hydrater or sports drink- full of natural electrolytes! We can highly recommend this resort and the tour- and we're definately making coconuts a part of our rhealthy diet.", "title": "coconut delight", "user": "JillaineW", "date": "September 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 20041701, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the architecture which blends into the natural scenery", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing really"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "amazing view and food", "text": "Stunning Location, worth paying extra for the beach view.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lawrencemichell", "date": "September 8, 2008", "id": 19868347}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled solo", "text": "Really great staff, friendly with fantastic service.", "title": "Food please?", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Daxidel", "date": "September 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 19866878, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Gorgeous beach", "disliked": "\u2014 Services too limited, staff overworked"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Couldn't get enough of the restaurant, a very talented chef works in that kitchen.", "title": "Wedding Perfection", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "WinePlease", "date": "September 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 19728779, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beautiful views, stunning pool setting and excellent dining experience", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "A very pleasant experince.
