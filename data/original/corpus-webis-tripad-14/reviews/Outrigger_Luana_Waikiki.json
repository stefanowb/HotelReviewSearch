We could see ours when sitting inside on the pullout couch. And it was spectacular! There are no buildings near the hotel to block your view just a wonderful grassy park. I had been a little leary that since it was right on the main street toward Waikiki it might have alot of street noise but I didn't notice and I usually am sensitive to that. Our room (911)was right above those fans from the restaurant next door but not noticeable with the door closed and we didn't have a problem talking to each other when sitting on the balcony. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had a nice size counter and narrow but adequate tub/shower. The blackout curtains were especially welcome. A microwave would have been a nice bonus but other rooms do have those. The refrigerator was on the large size for an undercounter one and the sink and counter came in handy. It had alot of cabinets and a full set of knives and enough plates, etc. which we didn't use but would be nice if you were staying for a while. The room felt good when you entered it.
