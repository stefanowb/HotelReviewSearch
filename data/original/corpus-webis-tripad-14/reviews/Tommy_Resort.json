Fantastic bungalows, the best of Staff. Food cheap and really good.. Nice pool..Nice beach and so close to the bungalows. Really feels like paradise. I have never been so relaxed before. We fellt like we were leaving our family behind when we had to say goodbye to the staff. They had such a great sense of humour and were so nice to us. It's a family owned resort and they are improving alot these days making the resort better and better. It's a really social resort, you will meet a lot of people here. It's not the cheapest on the beach, but the best.. Try the shakes that are fresh made and they just opened up a pool bar where you can enjoy a nice drink.", "title": "Fantastic Tommy Resort", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MacphersonCopenhagen", "date": "August 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8535000, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff, pool, beach and the bungalows.

We had cockroaches and we also had a mouse. The pool looks lovely but after seeing a guy gather all his flem in his mouth and spit it in the pool I decided not to go in.
