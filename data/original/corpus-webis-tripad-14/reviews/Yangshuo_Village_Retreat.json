The hotel is very well organized and makes it very easy to book tours that allow you to be independent of larger travel groups. The service in this regard is excellent. We booked this hotel on a Wed night and by Thu morning had already made arrangements to be picked up from the Guilin airport through the hotel and offered advice on taking a bamboo raft on the Li River. This whole pickup process went very smoothly. Once at the hotel, the mini-guide book that they provided in the room introduced us to an entire spectrum of activities that we had never even considered. Taking advantage of this information, we booked a tour through the hotel to the Dazai rice terraces. After an interesting drive through through the mountains, we hiked around Dazai and headed back to Guilin with enough time to catch our evening flight. The hotel recommended Dazai instead of Pingan because it was less touristy. While I can't compare because we didn't see Pingan, Dazai was pretty quiet and it seemed like we mostly had the place to ourselves.", "title": "Took my trip from good to great", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "badwaiter", "date": "May 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130712975}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed quite busy but the hotel itself is very nice and reminds me of the kind of place you might stay if you visit a mountain village in Italy or Switzerland.

Originally me & my boyfriend were booked to stay for 2 nights but ended up booking an extra 4! The hotel is in a beautiful part of Yangshuo away from the busy town and only 5 minutes from the Li river. The staff are very helpful with things that you can do near the hotel, including swimming in the Li river, horse riding, cycling to a few towns (depending how far you want to cycle) and Tai chi. When we were there bikes were 30CNY each for the day, horse riding was 120 CNY each for an hour and tai chi was 70CNY each for an hour (all very good prices compared to every where else!!) I think we really noticed how nice and peaceful the hotel was once we took a walk into town (about 20 minutes) and wanted to head straight back to Yangshuo village retreat. The rooms are beautifully decorated, with SOFT beds (rare in China...) and a lovely bathroom with rain shower. There is a flat screen tv in the rooms and you can hire a USB with as many films that will fit onto it for just 20CNY for one night. Unfortunately, it rained a few days we were in Yangshuo so the USB was a great escape! Not only is the setting beautiful, but the staff are also very friendly and helpful. The owner is available at all times and spoke to us on many occasions, not to mention the others - in paticular Jenny, Paul, Freya, Helen and Sunny (if I could remember more names there would be a huge list!) Nothing we asked was too much hassle, and Helen at reception organised for us to travel to Vietnam directly from the hotel. I am writing this now from Hanoi and I couldn't have asked for a better and more organised trip so thank you very much!! Helen also took us on the bamboo rafts (on her day off - not on a tour) which is well worth seeing, and was also very enjoyable as it was on a more casual basis rather than work related. The food is lovely at the hotel. We ate there every night eating both Western and Chinese dishes and all were really nice as well as being a very good price (food in town is the same price, if not more so for a secluded location we were very impressed!).
