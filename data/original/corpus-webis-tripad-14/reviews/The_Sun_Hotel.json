This is our fourth visit to an 'Old English Inn' and I am sorry to say far the worst. The hotel it's self was fine, well decorated, good 'pub grub', quite good service with pleasent staff. The location is also great,right in the town centre near all the shops with Hitchen Conservative Club 'next door' where the staff & members made us feel most welcome when we were obliged to visit them as the hotel 'ran out' of IPA bitter. But the rooms need a major refurbishment and are terribly noisy, we were located in the old stable annex across the courtyard. The bathroom doors have 'door closures' fitted and bang shut no matter how hard you can try to close the door gently on having to visit the bathroom during the night, this can be heard from each room throught the night. We had a European couple above us who returned each night at 0300, they must have been Dutch & wearing clogs for the noise of them walking back & forth prior to retiring was was deafening. They also appeared to have an argument each night for their loud voices kept us and others awake. Also on our first night we had a family next door who's children were playing in the carpark outside our window at 0645. I would not recommend this hotel because of the sleep quality (or lack of sleep).As I mentioned, we got an unbelieveable deal thus we didn't complain, but IF we had paid full price then complaints would have been submitted.

They were helpful from start to finish with advice on catering, booking rooms for guests, table layouts, etc. My chief bridesmaid and I stayed over the night before the wedding in a twin room. Friends joined us for the evening and chef did us all a lovely meal (warm chicken & bacon salad, washed down with a glass or two of fizz!). On the day of the wedding we had a cooked breakfast then headed off to the hairdressers - hotel is perfectly located in the town centre for hair/make-up etc.! We got back 2 hours later and my bags had been moved to the bridal suite (complimentary to the bride and groom!!), the photographer was waiting and the make-up lady had also turned up. The bridesmaids and I were let into the bridal suite for a few casual/fun photos before going back to our other bedroom to put our dresses on, returning to the suite again for more formal shots. In between all this, the photographer went downstairs and started taking photos of the groom/best man/page boys in the courtyard area - got some great shots of them all there! We got married at the Sun Hotel (rather than registry office), in the beautiful Ballroom. The staff were great, the Manager came to get me when it was time for the ceremony, gave me a few minutes to gather myself/shed a few nervous tears before walking down the aisle. They really know their stuff.... I hardly noticed they were there and yet everything was done just as we'd asked. I vaguely remember the manager taking the marriage certificate as we walked back out after the ceremony (it got put in the hotel safe, thank god because I would have lost it in all the fuss that followed with confetti, photos, etc.). Arrivals drinks were ready for the guests after the photos and in that time the Ballroom was set up for the wedding breakfast; it looked amazing (a post-wedding treat was to find the Manager had used our table-cameras to take a few photos of the room before the guests sat down, just as it had been decorated!) Our wedding breakfast was delicious, we'd met & discussed with the chef and he helped us decide on a lovely menu (the guys there also put a bottle of ros\u00e9 wine on the top table for me - we'd ordered red/white for all the other tables!). They sorted us out too when it came to speeches... they kept all the gifts/flowers cool on a hot day and brought them out when needed. With speeches over, we were gently ushered down to the courtyard bar/lounge area where the disco was already set up, doors open and evening guests starting to arrive.... we were so lucky with the weather, it meant guests could sit outside as the evening wore on - everyone said after what a wonderful & relaxed wedding day we had, the atmosphere was great and provided the perfect setting. I'm glad our guests felt relaxed & enjoyed themselves, that's what it's all about :) I have to say, I've never known time to go so fast as on our wedding day.... I cried when I realised it was nearly over, it had been perfect. We would have missed so many things if it weren't for the staff guiding us through our day... all of a sudden it was 9pm and we were taken to our cake for the official cutting (broke my heart cutting such a beautiful cake too), then we went straight into first dance while the cake was cut and served along with a lovely evening buffet. We used the resident DJ (Luc), emailed him a few song requests before the wedding and he played them all (even playing my favourite one twice that night!). We loved our day so much, we didn't want to go to bed (!!) and stayed up to see all our guests off and then Sharon (the manager) was kind enough to make my husband and I a lovely cup of tea... a lovely end to the day :) In the morning when we got up for breakfast we found all our cards and gifts, and even my bouquet, had been safely locked away - we'd forgotten all about them! Couldn't tell you much about the room except it looked great, really traditional (and looks wonderful in the wedding pics)... and that we slept like logs after such an exhausting day.
