All the hotels in the surrounding area, including Holiday Inn appeared to be fully booked in booking web sites. Nevertheless, I got a promotional newsletter for Exclusive Prepaid Rates in UK... but the same site was giving the option to book in Brussels in an unsurpassed rate ( 113 EUR/night ). This was one of the times that being a member of a loyalty scheme and get all these bulk promotional emails, did pay-off. Hotel was clean and reception was very efficient. I got (as per my priority club profile for preferences) a high-floor non-smoking room at the last floor (8th). They explained to me that although my Gold status has expired they would give a club room, but they were fully booked. Still I enjoyed a welcome free drink and internet access voucher. These small details make the difference in branded hotel chains. Especially next morning when I realised that I forgot my razor, the smilley receptionist literally run to their storage cabinets to give me a new one. Imagine the hassle in such a situation if I had booked in small a family-run hotel ... Queen size double bed, TFT TV, soft & firm pillows to choose. Shower only and not the usual full size bathtub. The only reason that I don't give a full 5* rating is due to the noisy fan in the bathroom. Not only it went on and on, even after lights were switched off, but it had a squicky noise. Additionally, the room next to mine was used as office facility by hotel personnel and doors were slammed early morning. Since the noisy bathroom fan affected \"sleep quality\" which to me is the factor of highest importance in a hotel stay, one star is deducted from top marks. Hotel is just 50 meters away from the Schuman metro station, therefore easy access to city center for dinner after a long tiresome day.
