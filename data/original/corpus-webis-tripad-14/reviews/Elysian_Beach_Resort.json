The advertised 3pm check-in does not apply to guests, only to time-share owners. For guests it's 4pm, but you won't find this posted anywhere. The front desk staff could hardly be more rude, in every dealing we had or observed others having. The pricing is simply dishonest. They charged a 12% room tax. A sign on the check-in desk said the room tax is 10%. In fact, St Thomas officials confirm that the room tax rate is 8%. Then there is the energy surcharge. This was not mentioned at all in our reservation or anywhere else we've found. The surcharge was 18% of the daily room rate. We were told this was a regular tax. It is not. Neither WAPA (the electric utility) nor the government charges any surcharge. Some other hotels charge $1 - $4 per day per room for increased energy costs, but the 18% charge is not found elesewhere. In our case this amounted to $25.74 per day above the room rate. This is nothing less than a trick to charge a higher room rate than quoted by the hotel or the agent. The overcharge on tax was refunded after protest to Wyndham, the parent of Fairfield Resorts, but only after their effort at another lie, to the effect that the room tax charged by the government changed between our reservation date and the date of our stay, which was completely untrue. Wyndham stood by their 18% energy surcharge, which by the way, bears no economic relationship to actual energy costs as far as my investigations reveal.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "VIFriend", "date": "April 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7271475, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 proximity to Red Hook", "disliked": "\u2014 rudeness and dishonesty"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled on business", "text": "As to the resort itself, it is well located and generally pleasant, although not well maintained.

Be prepared to pack some coffee along with anything useful you can refrigerate. I would suggest going to the Marina Market in Red Hook upon arrival to pick up a few things. The restaurant at the beach side called Bonnies is decent, but still expensive. You need to watch the wait staff, I was charged one morning $4 for a glass of milk by a waitress, but was refunded the money once I talked to the manager about the price later in the day. The waitress was ripping me off with a straight face. The other thing is to be aware that if you do not have a car, you should consider renting a car one for more thant 2 people, the cost to take a taxi one mile into Red Hook is $5 per person so round trip just to go to the market would be $10 per person. I did find out if you want to go into downtown that would be a $30 roundtrip cost. I would suggest that you make it to the main road at the end of the hll, which is a good walk and dangerous beause of the roads, and the public bus is a $1 and the safari taxi is $2....no one at the Elysian told me of optional transportion. Also Jamie who is the excursion coordiantor is very rude, she has an attitude, so beware of booking trips with her, she over ephasizes the trips, like all you can eat etc....and they are far from that on the day trips. I took the Breakaway day trip to the BVI which was highly recommened cost $108 and did not include a meal, the drinks were passed around in sippy cups that were recylced and the snorkle masks did not seem santiized. I had a sore throat the next day after drinking out of one of these cups. The day trip was suppose to last until 5pm and we arrived at 4pm the 7 - 5pm turned into 8 - 4 and was not worth the $108 after buying your own lunch figure costs aprrox $135 for the day.
