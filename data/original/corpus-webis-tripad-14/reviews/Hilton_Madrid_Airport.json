Room was more set up for bussiness, more so than vacation, and based on the location (by the airport, duh) would be perfect for its intended use. Be expected to pay 23 euro for a hamburger from the restaurant. Also, do not expect good service from the bar. We waited in the lounge for over 1/2 hour just to have our drink order taken. The restaurant girl finally came over (very nice, and apologetic) and took our order. She also brought our drinks and food when it was ready. I should state that the bar/lounge only had six patrons, it was not busy. The only time the bar waiter showed any intrest was when it was time to present the bill, 72 euro. Knowing that the restaurant girl would NOT recieve the tip, there was no tip given. We are Canadian, and we show great service with tipping. This would be our only negative remark. Would I stay here again?, Yes, yes I would.

Airport shuttle picked us up after 10 min wait. There are 4 airport pickup points and every 20 monutes appeared accurate. Shuttle took 15 min to go about 2-3 miles as they visit all stops before taking you to the hotel. Hotel is in the middle of nowhere in terms of walking. Check in was fast and room was nice sized, new, comfortable bed, 40\" flat screen, cable, all very nice like the pics. I used 30K hilton points and felt it was a good value. The bad news- internet 10 Euro/hr or 22 Euro/for 24 hrs! There was a breakfast buffet for 26 Euro/person. IF ordered the day before, breakfast + internet was 20 Euro. You can walk to the \"alameda\" metro stop, about 1/2 mile and pay only 1 Euro to ride the metro into the city center \"Opera\" or \"Sol\" stop in about 35 minutes. Safe area to walk to and from metro and the front desk provided an easy to follow map.
