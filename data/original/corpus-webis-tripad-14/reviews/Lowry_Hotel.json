And we were so pleasantly surprised by all it has to offer. Having a great hotel like the Lowry is also a bonus. The location of the hotel is top-notch, and we found that the online instructions got us there with ease, despite someone else's comment that it was hard to find. I also LOVED the parking lot right across the driveway. We could see our car from our city-view room, and felt comfortable leaving some items in the car, since the security seemed so good.", "title": "Take a detour to Manchester", "user": "kingsroadgal", "date": "August 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136989812}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The room was very comfortable. It was spacious with good sheets and REN toiletries in the bath. The large walk-in closet was nice as well. I enjoyed the book left in the room about the artist, L.S. Lowry, after whom the hotel is named. My sons' room had another title about the artist, so this gave a personal touch to the hotel. I did think that the hotel hallways had a bit of a blank look, but they were spacious. And my only real complaint is that the housekeeping staff did not seem to be at all friendly. Instead of being greeted in hall, the housekeeper averted her eyes when I passed, which surprised me in a hotel of this caliber.
