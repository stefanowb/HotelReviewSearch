I want to experience what the locals do on a regular basis, to truly see how life would be as if I actually lived there. After learning so much from friends and literature about San Miguel de Allende, my time had come to see what it was all about. My stay at Casa Cinco Patios allowed me all the amenities of the local flare I was hoping for. The location is perfect. It is set on the hill overlooking the city. I was within minutes walking distance to the enjoy all the city has to offer. It was easy to catch a taxi, both day and night, if ever I did not want to walk down or back up. But I most often chose to walk. I felt safe all the time. I couldn't wait to get back home at Casa Cinco Patios, and relax while watching the most amazing sunsets, which I must inform you, can only be appreciated from the hill looking over the city and mountains in the backdrop. I live in a spacious one bedroom condo in the French Quarter in New Orleans, with a plush courtyard I enjoy from my balcony. Casa Cinco Patios definitely made me feel like I had all could ever ask for and more. If ever you get a chance to go to San Miguel de Allende, make it worth you while and stay there.
