The hotel is located about a mile from Taksim Square, but not on a main road, but rather down a steep alley. There is nothing around it but auto shops. To get to anywhere requires either a taxi or a walk about a steep alley to a main street. That being said, the inside of the hotel is adequate. Indeed, the rooms are a little bigger than normal. Since it is a relatively new hotel, I need to cut it some slack for the off and on television, off and on internet(in the business area), and the lack of availability of reserved room due to \"technical difficulties\". To compensate my friend and I received a suite, but with only one bed. I had one night on an uncomfortable cot. The room was in the front of the hotel on the second floor, so all the outside noise saturated the room. The second room (for the final four nights) was much better. It was a double room (two twin beds) in the back of the hotel. The difference in the noise factor was enormous. Due to the mixup on our arrival, we received one morning's complimentary breakfast...It was quite good but I would never pay the 20 euro tab per person. We did receive some excellent assistance from Ghokahn. He was a reall asset. As a tip, if you go up the alley onto the main street, the street has a fork in the road. If you go to the right, by the Military Museum, you will enter a very upscale neighborhood with a number of upscale shops and restaurants. If you veer to the left, after about a mile, you will encounter a very westernized mall.", "title": "Very Comfortable Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jmmlaguna", "date": "September 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 118033421}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful and modern hotel", "text": "Pros", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "kceesse", "date": "January 2, 2012", "id": 122439108}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "- Just 5 minute taxi ride from the Taksim Square, which is a very popular and fashionable shopping district (but watch out for dishonest taxi drivers who would overcharge 3x)", "title": "Loved this hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "sandyjb83", "date": "December 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121901311}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "- Very modern hotel with beautiful and comfortable decor and furnishings", "title": "Disappointing & Over Priced Product, unlike Crowne Plaza", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "S A", "date": "December 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 121825940}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled on business", "text": "- Staff were very friendly throughout", "title": "Nice hotel strange location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "aeilat", "date": "November 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 120545489}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled on business", "text": "- Complimentary wi-fi", "title": "New Hotel in Central Turkey", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "R L", "date": "October 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119989938}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for one night.
