We had a king size bed, but one side of the bed is right up against the place to hang clothes, you couldnt walk between the bed and \"closet\". Other than that, it was ok.

It was a great location right on Universal Blvd! The first room we got had a noisy AC - they immediately switched us rooms to a better place.

The ladies every morning were helpful, courteous and greeted us with smiles and 'good morning' each day! Great assortment of food! The place was crowded when we went with tourists from everywhere - but despite that food was plenty and people were kind! The only downside is that there are 2 elevators for a building this large!

We just came for fun to walk around Pointe Orlando. The hotel is in a great location for reaching those i drive fun places. the hotel has recently been renovated. The decor is lovely. There was a bag given at check in (two of us at the desk) with one bottle of water. I wondered why not two but then it was a luxury not a necessity to the stay. :) There was water near by in two water pitchers...one with lemon and limes, the other plain-nice touch. The lovely, professional, friendly ladies at the desk set us up on the 7th floor, 714. Walking into the room it was SPACIOUS! The front living space had a 4 seater couch, a desk/dining table, a microwave, fridge and sink. I imagine utensils and such but we didn't eat in. That was nice to see so I expected the bedroom to have a lot of space. It didn't you HAD TO go in sideways to one side of the bed close to the closet which I would hit the ironing board on that side. No room. The other side near the window had little space to. There was a 2 drawer chest with a tv on it. (The tv could be hung high on the wall.) That space was more tight than it should be, esp to be ADA compliant. The curtain in the room should be longer. There was sunlight streaming in. The A/C was adequate when we came in. We turned it down to cool the room off. It didn't seem to stay cool but it was comfortable. The bathroom had a weird layout with the toilet being RIGHT UP next to the shower tub. The toilet paper roll was far across on the opposite wall..just a weird, uncomfortable layout. Again, these toilet and tubs aren't used the whole time so it was weird just when using them. The bed was fine and comfortable. The thing I look for in a hotel is the cost compared to amenities. I go to a hotel to get rest and relaxation. This is what I am paying for. Springhill Suites was outstanding. There was a lot more good than not so good. I would recommend this hotel but likely suggest a different room because of the tight fit around the bed. The best part was that I didn't hear any disturbing noise from nearby rooms or the hallway. That's a big plus when it comes to resting...We went to breakfast though the layout was uncomfortable and inefficient. There was lot of dining space so this could be accommodated some how. The rate we paid ($108) for included parking, wi fi, a king suite room, breakfast, a noon check out, and pool I see that the SHS has the Marriott brand down pat...great job!", "title": "lots of good, little not so good", "user": "KathyRcoupon", "date": "August 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173392906}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I spent one night with my family.

I cannot possibly sleep, because management and security of this hotel broke into my room about 30 minutes ago. Shortly before that, I heard a brief argument in the hallway and someone at my door. Figured it was an intoxicated guest on the wrong floor or something. About 10 minutes later, more noise at the door. Got up to go check the peephole, and call for security, and got to the door just in time to push it shut as someone broke the lock (the one with the solid bar). Looked in the peephole and no one was there. Called the front desk to ask for security - no answer. Waited a few minutes and got \"Abraham\" who told me I'd better get down to the front desk because he had called the police on me for being \"an unauthorized guest\" in the room -- which I had checked into (and my credit card was charged) at 2:45 pm. I refused, as he answered the phone with \"hello\" - not \"front desk\" or \"guest services\" and I was afraid something more sinister was going on -- and I was not comfortable leaving my 2 daughters alone in the room with a broken lock. Police arrived about 5 minutes later and refused to file a report -- saying it was just a misunderstanding. There was a do not disturb sign on the door -- my credit card was charged (and I hope my identity was not stolen) -- and the security bar in the room was closed. How the heck did they think I got in there, and why on earth would they not wait until morning or call the police to deal with this -- at 2 am??? Why didn't they at LEAST try to CALL the room before breaking in?? AT TWO AM!!!!!! Seriously -- if an unauthorized person WAS in the room -- and had ill intent -- the person breaking in the door (the night manager and unarmed security officer) could have been shot at point blank range.", "title": "WORST STAY EVER!!!!
