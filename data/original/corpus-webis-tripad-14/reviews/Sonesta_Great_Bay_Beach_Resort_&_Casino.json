It was like staying in a basement. One morning upon opening the curtains, a worker was right outside our sliding door watering the plants, not to mention the only road surrounding the island was 50 feet away. There was only 2 bottles of water in our refrigerator (supposed to be stocked with sodas, beers, and liquor).

The water is not crystal clear (probably because the waves are so strong) but it is still very beautiful. The beach leading to the water is very steep and the sand is somewhat coarse, but these were not significant issues since the beach is so gorgeous otherwise. You can rent a float from the hotel to take into the ocean and lay on- my fiance found that very relaxing. There was a very faint smell of sewage every once in awhile as we were laying on the beach, which we overheard other couples notice as well. It wasn't strong enough to really bother us though and it wasn't there all the time. The \"island ladies\" were a little annoying to me because they were so loud talking amongst themselves when I really just wanted to relax and not hear voices right in my ear. The hotel needs to get rid of them. We saw them asking people to go up to the buffet and bring them back free food! Don't expect the person who mans the beach towel stand to be there very often. It was frustrating when we went down there at 9 or 10 am and no one was there to hand out towels. Luckily, we had packed our own and used them. There were a couple island dogs roaming around the beach. They were sweet and harmless but it was extremely depressing to see what bad shape they were in. We gladly snuck them some food and water from the buffet.

I am not a meat lover, but was always able to find something to eat. Unfortunately, there is no pasta ever at any meal, at least not while we were there. There is always chicken or ribs or lamb or roast beef for lunch and dinner at the buffet. They have great fresh salad foods and decent desserts. I am a VERY picky eater and I never went hungry, so that should say something. The quality of their meat was excellent, too. The best place to eat though, in my opinion, is the grill down by the pool during lunch. They have pizza, burgers, hot dogs and french fries. However, they did run out of french fries one day, which was a little irritating because that just should not happen at a hotel that advertises itself as all-inclusive. They actually ran out of other things as well, like beach towels and certain drinks, so I think that's why this annoyed me.
