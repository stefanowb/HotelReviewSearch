Unfortunately, this one didn't meet my expectations for a quiet nights sleep. I'll start with the pros: I liked the size of the 700sq ft corner room. Overall size of the property is nice with a lot of amenities, and public spaces were clean. Cons: After reviewing other traveler reviews, I requested a \"quiet room in the back\" based on a few of the \"tips\" found on Trip Advisor. When I checked in, I was informed that they \"have taken care of me\" and \"we got you\". If at all possible, do what I wish I had done: Gone back downstairs and asked for a room not facing the highway. The headboard rattled due to the volume of traffic that is right across the road. I made due and it was fine, but will not return. I do have to mention that the bathroom was not cleaned well, but no need to harp.

She explained that the $79 was only when they had a lot of rooms available and currently they did not, never mind what their website said. Finally she booked me in for $119 and said I was all set. When I arrive, they have no reservation for me. The front desk supervisor, Ian, was no help. He wanted to charged me even more than the $119. I finally got him to go to THEIR website where he found the $79 rate and tried to book me. He could not book me on THEIR website either.

We anticipated large crowds at all of the trendy chain restaurants around the Galleria and usually like to avoid that if possible. Being a fan of restaurant.com, I searched for restaurants in the vicinity of the Energy Center. We decided to give the Grill at the Sheraton Suite Galleria a try and were not disappointed. Being a hotel restaurant, it was fairly small - about 10 or 12 tables. The waiter was cleaning one other table when we came in, but we were the only people there the entire time we were there. The bar had a couple of tables and there seemed to be a couple of people dining in that area. The menu is very limited, but our food was excellent. My husband ordered the \"Chef's inspiration\" which was a salmon dish and I chose a simple hamburger and fries. Our waiter seemed a \"unprepared\" but otherwise was attentive and very polite. I would not make a special trip just to eat there, but would certainly eat there again if looking for a meal in the area.

I thought our room was a great value. Very spacious, clean and comfortable. The little things were overlooked like the curtain rod was on the floor, just very small things. Overall a great stay and I was sooo excited to write a good review and rave about how great the experience was until check out came. They somehow managed to charge me three times for the room!!!! the reservation was made through booking.com but they said that this was a hotel made error that I was charged this many times. I sent booking.com bank statements and the hotel receipt and they contacted the hotel. Through speaking with their front desk agent Nyla, they said that one refund should come through, which it did, and that another one may or may not process through within 14 days. I'm left here just waiting and wondering for 14 days if a refund will ever come which makes me mad and uncomfortable.

We would have sprung for this daily charge, but the hotel couldn't get the wireless to work in the room, either. They sent someone to take care of this issue for us. He came to our room and told us he would reset the router and would return to our room the make sure everything was working. He never returned and the internet connection was not repaired. The second big issue is that the sliding doors between the sitting area and the bedroom are stuck in the open position. This might not be a big issue for most people, but is a huge one for us since we have different sleep and work schedules and it makes it difficult to move around the room without disturbing each other. The door to the bathroom and a closet door are also stuck and will not slide.
