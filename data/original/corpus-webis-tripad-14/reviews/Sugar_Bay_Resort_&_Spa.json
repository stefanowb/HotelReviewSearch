The service at the pool bar was good with the Cruzan rum overflowing the drinks and several TV to catch any scores that you might need. however at the pool, pool bar and beach areas the resort plays this awful NYC elevator music that even put the Iguana to sleep. How about playing some tropical Caribbean sounds that actually make you feel like your in a warm beautiful place.

Monica the wedding coordinator was very helpful and because of her our wedding was much talked about during our week stay. Unlike other peoples experience the staff was courteous and helpful. My favorite bartender Doc deserves Kudos. Don't worry about the stairs down to the pool there is a shuttle that runs every 15 min. But after eating all the wonderful food we needed to work out a little anyway. Some of the complaints that my guest had were (the buffet food wasn't hot, food at the Caribe wasn't hot when it arrived and they took the plates to the wrong people twice. The ribs at the Iguana Grill were excellent but weren't frequently available. Also I really think that Bride & Groom should be offered a suite.

Their dinner - when not a buffet - was outstanding. Baci is the Italian restaurant down by the pool and it was good, as well. I did not enjoy the Mangrove's daily lunch buffet at all (same stuff everyday and not appealing) but did enjoy the Pimento's burgers. I was surprised that, for an all inclusive, the rooms did not include anything stocked in the fridge for those of us going A-I. I was also surprised that they didn't have drink machines at the bars (getting a frozen drink took a bit of time). The inside bar at the pool was crowded and it took a while to get drinks.
