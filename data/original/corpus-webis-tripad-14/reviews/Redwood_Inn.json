We especially enjoyed Mr. Yan Cheung who gave us a wealth of information about visiting his city, recommended a Chinese Restaurant in Chinatown, and generally was entertaining as well as informative. We found it to be close enough to walk to Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardilli Square (twice!). The famous \"crooked\" part of Lombard St. is within a mile of this location.
