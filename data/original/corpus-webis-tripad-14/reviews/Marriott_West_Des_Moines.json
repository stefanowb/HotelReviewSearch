The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We ate in the dining area and the food was delicious and priced about the same as anywhere else. On Sunday morning we enjoyed a breakfast buffet with omelets made to order. A shuttle was available that would take you to area restraunts and the mall. There was a full gym with updated equipment located near the pool area. I did notice a musty odor in that area, but the rest of the hotel smelled clean. The rooms appeared to be recently refurbished, beds were comfortable. The bedding and pillows were perfect. The only problem with the room was the air conditioner; it \"clunked\" when it started and shut off but it was such a minute issue that we didn't bother to complain to the front desk. Overall it was an enjoyable stay with an impressive staff and we would definately stay there again.", "title": "Would Stay Here Again", "user": "rejami", "date": "September 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 139462125}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here for the weekend while doing some work in Iowa.", "title": "Affordable price with all the ammenities", "user": "KentuckyDerbyfan", "date": "August 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138970297}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Pros:", "title": "Great place for convention", "user": "Murphydd", "date": "August 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 138899945}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled on business", "text": "* Great weekend rate <$110 a night", "title": "Smelly rooms", "user": "FreqTraveler43323", "date": "August 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138057755}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "* Typical full service Marriott room", "title": "So Impressed!!", "user": "Sierra P", "date": "August 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 137924845}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "My family has a reunion here every year.

Hotel has been remodeled since we stayed 2 years ago. Very nice decor, comfortable beds and bedding. Free wifi internet was very nice also. Was hoping to get a small refridgerator for our room, but none were available. Our room was right off the lobby, first floor - we were concerned about noise, but it was not an issue. The air conditioner in our room was very noisy - made it hard to sleep. A few things we were not happy with - they did not refill the coffee in our room - had to go looking for it and a lid for my cup. Tried calling the front desk from my phone - button didn't work. Went out in the lobby, and the front desk was not too helpful. Bartender was very helpful - had both a coffee packet and a lid. Also - they did not give us a new bar of soap after our first two nights - had to ask for that too. They also told us bagels would be available for purchase at 5:30am the next morning - and they were not there. We had a 6:30 am match to get to. As one of the host hotels for the tournament, they did not seem very accomodating. As far as a nice place to stay - very good for that.
