My husband and I stayed in the Clarendon Suite for 3 wonderful nights and had an amazing time. Michael, Viktor and Winnie did an incredible job of leaving you alone to your privacy, while supplying you with anything you might need. For example - the rooftub hotub (the icing on the cake! truly amazing) is open 24/7 and you run it yourself. No babysitting, so you really feel at home, but they are very attentive should you need anything. The decor is modern and antique mixed, lots of great books and movies to borrow, with a nice breakfast. Location is great, a quiet, private street but right near the best of the South End. Lots of thoughtful, small touches and details really make the difference.
