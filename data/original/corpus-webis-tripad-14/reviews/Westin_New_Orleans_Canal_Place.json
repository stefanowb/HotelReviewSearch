Ordered room service one night and had the shrimp po-boy which was surprisingly really tasty! Used the workout room a few times and it's decent.

Peters St. when walking back to the hotel from the Quarter, because New Orleans drivers don't respect the whole \"pedestrian in the crosswalk\" thing; they just whizz right by. (That's hardly the hotel's fault, but I thought you might want to take it into account when choosing your accommodations.) The room's TV was a little small and was either standard definition or only receiving a standard definition signal; in my view, that's a little subpar for a hotel of this class and quality. The Heavenly bed wasn't all that heavenly, but I'm also a Tempurpedic person so that probably colors my perspective on the issue. When you exit on the Iberville side, you feel a touch removed from everything because you're almost back by the streetcar tracks, but the location probably merits a 4.5/5 considering how easily accessed the Quarter and Canal Street are.", "title": "Stunning location with river views and dog friendly!.", "user": "Angela B", "date": "January 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 123139272}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled solo", "text": "So overall, this was a legitimate four star experience.
