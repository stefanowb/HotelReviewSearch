The room was ok. The furniture was worn in the living room. The beds were not comfortable. The windows were extremely dirty. The set up of the room was great. When you walk into the room you were in the living room (ceiling fan) with a small kitchen area to the right, Straight ahead was a bedroom with 2 queen (?) beds and a full bathroom. There was a tv in the living room and one in the bedroom on the first floor. There was a flight of steps leading to the other bedroom. It was a penthouse (open to the other areas) with a king size bed, ceiling fan and a 19 inch tv. You could not watch tv on the second floor if someone was watching tv in the living room (unless you were watching the same show) due to the noise level. There was a full bathroom in the penthouse area. The bathroom on the second floor was old. Some of the tiles were coming up from the floor. The wireless internet worked great. We did not make it for the manager's reception but we did eat breakfast daily. We were in building 5 and it was a short walk to the lobby building. It was cold when we were there but we were finally able to use the pool on the last day. While we stayed here, we went to Universal Studios.

I didn't really want to stay at the Wyndham, so I started looking around. The Residence Inn has free breakfast, free internet access and free weekday social hour, and the rooms are very spacious. When I arrived for my meetings, I found out that the Wyndham is very spread out so that most of the rooms are far away from the convention center. It turns out that my room at the Residence Inn across the street was closer to the convention center than most people staying at the Wyndham. In addition, at the Wyndham they charged an additional \"resort tax\" that allowed you to use the pool and other amenities that were free at the Residence Inn. I've seen the other bad reviews, but I had no major problem with the Residence Inn. I did have a problem the first day with the housekeeping staff. I had placed the magnet on my door for \"no service\", but when I got back to my room, someone had come in and cleaned it. The next day I moved the magnet closer to the handle, and they did not enter my room again. Other than that everything was fine. If you are comparing it to other Residence Inns, you might be disappointed, but if you need a place near the Wyndham convention center, you will be very happy. Also if you think you need to be at the Wyndham so that you'll have internet access while you are in your meetings in the convention center, forget it. Everyone in my meetings complained that the Wyndham's internet access was not working in the hotel rooms or the convention center. Here's some advice if you are staying here to be close to the convention center. The rooms closest to the convention center are right on the road. On the other hand, the property is somewhat spread out, so if you try to stay away from the road, you will be further from the convention center.

This is one of the few hotels that I didn't feel afraid to put my bare feet on the floor. They have free internet in the room, and a wonderful free hot breakfast! There is an outdoor pool that was very clean. Next door to the tiny fitness room is a place to do your laundry for $2.00 to wash and $2.00 to dry. The front desk gentleman was very friendly. The only two negative things I have to say is that they have no theme park transportation (if that is important to you), and the people that stayed above us kept yelling at there son all night as he raced across the floor late into the night.

Minor cleaning issues on the back o a bathroom door but a trip to the nearby Wal Mart for food supplies & clorox wipes solved that. Booked through Mariott's site & extra requests for pillows fulfilled before we arrived. Pool nice place to relax after a busy day at the parks. Breakfast was a little crowded at times but not unmanageable - plenty of selections from fruits, cereals, eggs, waffles, etc. Room was the 2 story / 2 beedroom. No noise heard from neighbors or slaming doors. Didn't feel scared for my family on the property. Mamagement would always ask if we needed anything when we were in the lobby or if they saw us on property. The Mariott Club lady next to the front desk left daily messages for a free gift but I assumed a timeshare pitch came with it...could be mistaken. All in all it was a plesent stay for the money.
