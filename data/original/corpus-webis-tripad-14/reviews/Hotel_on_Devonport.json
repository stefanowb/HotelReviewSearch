I was there for business and could walk everywhere. Very secure hotel with small lobby at the front entrance and swipe card car garage at the rear. Staff were welcoming and friendly and their service throughout my 2 day staff was excellent. Room was very modern with lovely bathroom, consisting of wash basin, toilet and shower. Plenty of fresh thick towels, soaps, shampoos etc were provided and bathroom was immaculately clean. Main room had a couch, kingsize bed (with lovely linen), built in desk area with internet access, chairs and a tv. TV was about 21inch old style television which I think let down the rest of the rooms modern feel but it worked well and had all the major TV channels and Sky. There were built in wardrobes, minibar, toaster, microwave, jug etc behind mirrored doors. There was a very small deck through a door/window but this is why I rated this hotel above average rather than excellent as my room overlooked a grotty back alley. Curtains shut that view out nicely but as the hotel was no where near full I felt they could have given me an ocean view - my advice ask for ocean view.
