We wanted to stay out of the way of the tourist-hoards that occupy much of the island, so we deliberately picked Marsaxlokk. This made choosing accommodation easy as Duncan's guest House was the only accommodation we could find in the village. That said, we were really glad we made the decisions we did. Yes it meant that we had to take a bit longer on the dinky buses to get anywhere, and yes it meant that we had a view of the industrial harbor (not that bad actually - quite pretty at night!) but Marsaxlokk is a really chilled out pretty village. It has a tourist market during the day but when that is over the place is peaceful and occupied by locals. We ended up staying in a flat arranged for us by Michael who works at (and may be related to) Duncan's Guest House.", "title": "Absolutely brilliant.

I got the impression Michael had a few options up his sleeve if we decided we didn't like the accommodation he provided. He also helped us with a taxi when we wanted to get to the wedding, and helped us find shops and helped us figure out the buses. In the end we felt more like one of the locals and had a really lovely five day break. Even if you don't decide to stay at Duncan's Guest House, or indeed in Marsaxlokk I would highly recommend avoiding the crowds of St Julians and the like.
