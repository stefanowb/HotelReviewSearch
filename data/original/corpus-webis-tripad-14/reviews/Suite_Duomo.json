Ferrara is a UNESCO world heritage town. You may not care, but for those more sensitive to such associations; if you are a Renaissance scholar or a romantic traveller with a romantic notion of Ferrara perhaps, then try staying at one of the quaint hotels around the centre. If the price leads you to Suite Duomo, demand a room at the front which faces the Cathedral. At least then, you will have a view and wont be woken up each morning before 7am by the most horrendous noise and tremors from the garbage trucks doing their business at the back lane behind McDonalds.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 17, 2005", "id": 3676487}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "The room was huge, particularly by Italian standards. No attempt at Renaissance style, just modern cheapish fittings. I stayed 3 nights and my sheets were not changed. Tiled floors, and the kitchenette is inside a cupboard (no oven or microwave). Its all a bit sterile, but easy to keep clean. I had what was ironically and somewhat sacriligiously called the Isabella d'Este suite, no. 809. Don't stay there if the early morning noise would bother you and the ugly outlook. I hired a bicycle from a sweet old man two blocks away and that is the best advice I can give you for a stay in Ferrara. I even circumnavigated the ancient city walls. The young man on the desk here, was very genial and smiled a lot. Breakfast on the terrace is cute but dont try the orange juice which is cordial. There is a supermarket CONAD about 5 minutes walk. Use it, for there are not a lot of charming places to eat in Ferrara, you will be surprised. Even the locals agreed with me. Many places are closed for July/August. Suite Duomo would be a great idea for families and for budget minded people who do not expect stylish accommodation.", "title": "Suite Duomo and Ferrara", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "daburke3", "date": "July 8, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3648870}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Suite Duomo ......

A portable fridge on the dresser had a fan that made so much noise it had to be unplugged.
