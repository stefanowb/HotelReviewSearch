First of all, it was so annoying to get access to my suite in the other building because you have to go up to the top floor of the first building then you have to cross (literally cross to the other building) then take another elevator down to the floor where my suite was located. My suite was huge but it was dusty, smelly, and unattended for quite sometime as you can see the dust all over the place - tables, lamps, chairs, windows, floors and etc! To make matters worse, the window draping were insufficient and improperly hanged, causing all the lights to come in during the day time which is my time to go to sleep! I think the bathroom was oudated and in badly need or renovation. I think the bath tub is constructed too high making guests too difficult to get into the tub. Talking about safety and accessibility! The desk staff are not pleasant and friendly except the room boys and lobby attendants. The hotel is situated in a busy area wherein you have to take a cab to go shopping and all.", "title": "disappointing, below average!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Onard", "date": "February 14, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 55982657}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I arrived a 1:45 pm, the front desk said my room wasnt ready, im ok with that, so i come back at 4pm,,,they told me my room still wasnt ready and I had to wait an additional 45 minutes!
