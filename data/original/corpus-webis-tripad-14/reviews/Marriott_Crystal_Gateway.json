The room was fine...bed was great and it was very quiet. Only noise you could hear from the hall were people talking as they passed by. Our room didn't have refrigerator or nightly turn down service as others have mentioned. The package came with free breakfast and that was a great option. Very nice buffet that ran until 1 pm on the weekends (which was great timing for us) and 10:30 during the week. The garage was very convenient and while $22 is a lot for parking, I think it's in line with the area. My only complaint is about computer access. I hate that they charge $12 something/night to use in the room (while you can use in public areas for free) and that the charge for the PC in the business center was around $7.50 for 15 minutes. I did see a computer/printer behind the concierge for printing boarding passes, but really don't like it when hotels play that game. For me, the location and ease of getting to DC outweighed this challenge and I would stay again.", "user": "na07950", "date": "March 6, 2012", "id": 125707039}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Our organization held its 25th Annual conference at the Marriott.

They run deals on a regular basis for the weekends, some deals include the breakfast buffet. Buffet choices are extensive, food at the Mez restaurant is very good. The bar makes a lovely Cosmo (they call it something else but whatever the name it is yummy)! However it is the hotel and restaurant staff, that make the experience special.

Beautiful!! In researching a place to stay I wanted something close to the airport and the Metro. The Crystal City metro station is the first stop on the blue line when leaving the airport (DCA). The metro station and hotel are linked via an underground walkway making it unnecessary to go outside. As a note of caution (since we first went to the wrong Marriott), let me add that there are two Marriott's at the Crystal City metro station. To reach the Marriott Gateway (the one on which this review is based) TURN RIGHT when you exit the Metro area, before you go outside. If you turn left, you'll go to the other Marriott.) The beds were super comfortable. The rooms were quiet. We had adjoining rooms with one of the rooms being a mini-suite (living room and bedroom areas separate) and the other being more of the typical hotel room. The only disappointment with the hotel is the charge for Internet ($12.95 plus tax for 24 hours). Also, the elevators seemed to be much slower than other hotels at which I've stayed. The Crystal City shops are very near (close to the metro station) with a variety of eating and shopping places. All in all we had a great experience.
