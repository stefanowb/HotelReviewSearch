Rooms in the rear of the hotel are quiet though. I would reccommend this hotel for the excellent location and clean comfortable rooms. Rate I booked one month before trip was $189 a night.

There was a nice complimentary continental breakfast, and an excercise room and internet room (which we did not use). For a hotel at this level, you really couldn't expect more.

It was close to Times Square (1/2 a block away) and close to grand central station (3 blocks). The most important thing was that the rooms were clean. The bathroom was clean too! I know that other reviews said something about church bells, but we were right next to the church and didn't hear the bells. The only noisy thing was our child neighbor screaming at 11pm and then slamming the door to her room about 10 times. This is of course nothing that the hotel could have controlled. It was very convient to have free internet access (two computers) in the lobby. The free breakfast was also very nice. My fiance even used their fitness room which was very small but had a bike, treadmill, and stairmaster. The best part of this hotel was the unbeatable price of $110 per night! I would stay here again and reccommend it to my friends!", "title": "Clean with a great location", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "AlissaFr", "date": "August 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5614114, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Price!", "disliked": "\u2014 The loud neighbors"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Oh and we also stopped in Havanna central (right on 46th street a couple doors away from the hotel) for dinner and it was fantasitic especially the mojitos!", "title": "building work!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "john7glen", "date": "August 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5611046, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, great for Times Square"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Better than expected", "text": "Nice hotel, at this price. First room offered was a single (that claimed to be a double). I could not see two 200lb people getiing into the bed. They changed our room for a better one. Main problem was the buiding work going on inside the hotel. They had completed the restyling of first four or five floors, but the work was still going on as we could see every day. Men carrying plaster board in the lifts and old units out meaning that only one of the two lifts was available most of the time. Place was dusty desoite the constant effort of the staff.

We had booked a room with a King bed and sofabed in November 2005. Due to the other comments on this site I rang the day I was checking in to be told byu the hotel they do not have king size beds with a sofabed in the same room. This made for a very uncomfortable stay for my husband, our eight year old and me in one bed. My brother-in-law slept in the other bed. We have not yet had an apology from the hotel, although we booked through Choice Hotels. Anyway, we had a room on the twelth floor and had fantastic views of both the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. We walked the stairs most of the time, and it was great to walk the various staircases and to see the old building, including watching the mail go down the chute. Our room was always clean.
