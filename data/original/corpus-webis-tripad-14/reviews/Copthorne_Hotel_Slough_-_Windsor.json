There was a double bed in one room and a double pullout couch and a single camp bed in the other room. There was ample room for the five of us.

We booked through Legoland and managed to get a reasonable rate which included tickets, breakfast (normaly \u00a316.95 per head) and parking (\u00a36 per day). We arrived quite late on the Friday night but had no problems with check in and were quite quickly on our way to our room on the 4th floor. The room itself was quite spacious and had a put up bed in addition to the double bed and the bedding was clean and fresh. There was no minibar as this was classed a standard room - you only get a minibar if you upgrade to a Club Room. All in all the room was fine although the air conditioning was not great and the room was very warm - I wouldn't like to imagine the temp during the summer. The bathroom was clean and tidy and the towels were nice and fluffy. The shower was fantastic. We ordered room service which was prompt and courteously delivered although nothing special for the cost. Breakfast was very organised with a good selection. On the Saturday evening a wedding was underway in the Hotel. There was some noise but we were all able to get to sleep quite easily - after a full day in Legoland you could probably sleep standing up. However - yes you guessed it - at 5.25am the fire alarm went off so off we all trudged outside. Again it seemed quite organised however it was quite apparent some people were still in their rooms and remained there during the exercise. We were back in our rooms for 5.45am. The hotel is in a good location for Legoland and while we didn't dine in the hotel we were quite close (2 miles) to a Toby Carvery which was of good quality and great value. Parking is available in the hotel car park which is well lit, has CCTV and an attendant although trying to get a space when a function is on was difficult. We would not hesitate to return if we visited Legoland again.

We have stayed in worse. The room was basic but clean enough for me the bathroom was ok too. Nice colour tv with loads of channels and internet acess if needed.
