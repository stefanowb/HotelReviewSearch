The hotel is about 7 miles from the south rim, located by several restaurants and shops. The room was clean with several strange features. First, the bed pillows were about 1/2 the size of normal; overstuffed and pretty uncomfortable. I ended folding up a bath towel and using that for a pillow. When we first entered the room, 2 of the lightbulbs were dead which were replaced within the hour. The air conditioner was not cool; luckily it was a cool night so bearable. There were 2 sinks; one was a strange height; very low. The other was normal. The tub was extra large. The room was quiet and the bed was fairly comfortable. The buffet breakfast was adequate. the hifi was free, but incredibly slow.

One complaint; this hotel doesn't have an elevator to the 2nd floor. My husband has a bad back and hauling luggage was a problem but we managed. If you need an elevator, ask for a room on the 1st floor. The staff is very polite and helpful.
