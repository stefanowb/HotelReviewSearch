{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 474, "name": "Ramada Caravela Beach Resort", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Spent a week of holidays at the Ramada. Check-in was extremely efficient and after ten minutes, we were in our room and baggage delivered a minute later. The room, category deluxe, was reasonably sized, adjacent to the pool, but quiet, modern-western styled, with large mirrors, no Indian influence (a bit a pity), except for the Goan \"Azulejos\" in the bathroom. There is a large flat screen TV with many channels, including BBC and CNN, a German, French, but no Spanish channel (Portuguese seems to be forgotten in Goa anyhow). Air conditioning is excellent, very quite and delivers the desired temperature within minutes. There is a coffee maker, coffee is replenished regularly and sufficiently. There is no ironing board and no slippers. Laundry bag had to be ordered, laundry and house holding services good. Bed very comfortable, room service and cleaning twice a day, we never had a complaint. Nice pool landscape, however guests reserve the sun beds with towels shortly after 7 AM, even though there is warning that unused towels will be removed if not used within two hours. The open air jacuzzi is charged at INR 150 for 10 minutes. Breakfast is good, eggs made to order, except that European style crusty bread is missing and the variety of fruit was limited. We had half-board, so we had buffet dinner every night. The majority of dishes is Indian style, quite tasty and delicious. The service is friendly, but not always efficient. There are no smoking sections in the restaurants, even if they are outdoor. But there is a tiny smoking zone just near the pool. There were no theme evenings during our stay, just live bands playing international evergreens and oldies often with playback. Took a glimpse at the casino \"Goa Nugget\" and the discotheque \"Saturday\", both were empty, maybe more guests appeared later in the evening? The Sunset Bar is located at the sea front, relaxing and romantic, service sometimes not attentive, depending on the waiter. The garden is large and well groomed, actually it is a golf course, though we never saw anyone playing. The beach is lovely, not crowded, and appears endless. The sand is whitish, except near the waterline it is slightly tainted grey presumably from an oil spill some years ago, what a pity. It is quite clean, because in front of the hotel, the hotel staff picks up litter every morning. The ocean was quite calm and swimming possible at all times. There are strong undercurrents. There are some beach shacks nearby, we chose the \"Sabores de Goa\" 200 meters to the South, which is very price worthy and serves excellent food, e.g. fresh tiger prawns, delicious French fries, aloo gobi, etc. You can use their sun beds free, you will be expected to take a drink or so at the shack. The beach peddlers are less aggressive then up North, but they do ask for two or three times the price you would pay e.g. in Margao, so you must bargain. The taxis near the hotel are expensive, a drive to Margao and back cost us INR 900, plus 50 INR per hour waiting. In Margao a taxi offered a one-way drive for INR 250. In Varca, a taxi asked for INR 300 for half the distance. But the hotel taxis are comfortable with air-con and reliable, educated drivers, etc., and compared to taxis in European cities, they still are affordable and walking to Varca will not guarantee you find a cheap taxi. The three-wheel motor rickshaws seem to have disappeared. A word to the tips in general: We gave tips of INR 30 - 100, depending on the service, which was usually highly appreciated, in average, INR 50 will be adequate. Guests at the hotel were mainly British, German, Indian, Swiss, etc., plus a large Russian community. The hotel personnel is very friendly, even the garden workers greet when you walk by. Overall, it was a very enjoyable and relaxing stay.", "title": "Relaxing and Comfortable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "March 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25597919}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights and had a pretty good time.", "title": "Nice resort, far far away from city", "user": "NK2009", "date": "February 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 24993375}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Good Things:", "title": "Lots of positives....", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "blueguru", "date": "February 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 24332485, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Proximity to beach, never felt busy.", "disliked": "\u2014 prices of drinks"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled with family", "text": "1.
