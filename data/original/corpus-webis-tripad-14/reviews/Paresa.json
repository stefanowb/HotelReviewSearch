Beautiful design, eco friendly, romantic, tranquil location (but quite remote) with some of the most stunning views! Our villa was excellent and had plenty of sun all day, a fantastic sunset and wonderful scenery. Large bedroom/living room, a huge bathroom with indoor/outdoor shower and bathtub. Coffee machine, dvd and Ipod dock. Sufficient private pool next to the terrace with comfy sun loungers. The bed was very comfortable. Enough bottles of complimentary water are provided in the villa in the morning and in the evening. Both Thai and Italian dishes at the restaurant are really nice and prices are decent for the quality. The setting only is worth paying for!! Fabulous! Breakfast was ample and not overwhelming. They have a great modern fitness room and a spa (never tried). Main pool area is good with sun loungers and breathtaking views. Never felt the hotel was crowded despite some days it was fully booked. The beach club at Kamala beach is enjoyable, although they don\u2019t have toilette or shower. There is a public restroom with showers couple hundred meters away. They have their own comfortable sun loungers, towels and offer complimentary water (and replenish it throughout the day!). Drinks are available and think it was possible to order food as well but not necessary since plenty of restaurants around on the beach. Think Paresa had one of their best staff members at the beach club; really friendly and service minded. Kamala beach is ok, but not the best in Phuket. Sand is not as soft (large granular) although water is good (shallow and sand bottom). Paresa is pretty young (2009) so still room for improvements.

Since no telephone around the pool it made situation even more difficult. Couple times they tried to charge for water claiming they had run out of the complimentary water. After that I opposed to this complimentary water was served 5-10 minutes later. Bizarre. Difficult ordering food (no staff!). No cold towels or afternoon refreshers as had been mentioned by hotel.

Taxi prices from the hotel are a royal rip-off. Taxis always charge Thb 100 less than the hotel car. So obviously they follow the hotel prices. The minimum charge is Thb 300 which will take you to Kamala beach 10-15 minutes away. To Surin and Patong (about 20-25 minutes away) the charge is Thb 700. In Bangkok taxi fare for one hour is about Thb 100!! The hotel must start negotiate with the drivers (there is no negotiation today!) The hotels in the area as a group or the hotel organization in Phuket should have a joint strategy. It\u2019s not good for tourism! Even if Paresa is beautiful, it may result in guest choosing other hotels which are less remote or having better transport options. The hotel offers a shuttle twice a day to their beach club (at 10 and at 1 pm).
