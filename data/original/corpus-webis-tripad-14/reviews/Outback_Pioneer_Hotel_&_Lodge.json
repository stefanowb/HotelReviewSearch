To see Uluru was a dream come true, and I certainly enjoyed that aspect of it, but I am shocked that YHA supports this property because it was so incredibly dirty and badly stocked. The dorm room was a 20 share, and was fine. I don't mind a dorm room even if it is huge, although being winter the nights were very cold and the concrete building did not seem to have any way to heat it. My problem was mostly with the kitchen- it was filthy! It never seemed to be cleaned and with so many people using it, there were hardly any utensils, pots or pans. The cook-your-own BBQ area was right beside the hostel and it constantly stunk of meat and grease! Did not seem to be cleaned properly either. Atleast while you stay here, you can use the pools of the other resort hotels, and the grounds and lookouts are nice to have a look around. In a way I would receommend this place for the budget traveller to see Uluru- as there is nothing else around with decent prices- but please be aware of what you are goign to be staying at.

Anyway, if you want to visit the rock, you are forced to stay somewhere in the area at least for one night. We stayed at the lodge accommodation since it was the least expensive option at the resort. The rooms (we had a 4 bed dorm) were extremely small. It felt ridiculous to be in the middle of a vast desert and stay in a such a small room. We were 4 people and had no chance for example to be able to open our suitcases at the same time. Bathrooms & showers were in another building, not so cool if you have to go in the middle of the night, but they were clean and ok.

In fact, Yulara is the typical place that was thought, projected, built and managed with the only purpose of milking the tourists; I only hope that part of the money they collect is invested in favor of the Aboriginal communities (which I would not be so sure of, because on the contrary the entrance fee to the Uluru-Kata Tjuta park is extremely popular). Returning back to the hotel, it resembles rather closely some overseas military facilities, with the basic difference that military-managed places are significantly cleaner. Well, we shouldn't forget we are in the Outback, with all its peculiarities, where everything must be imported from far away; but they should not forget the use of the brush. The help-yourself-BBQ (gas heated) is a nice way to give the guests the idea of being in a wild place, and to make savings on personnel salaries. I slept in a 4-bed shared, together with a friend, an over-65 HD biker (great guy!), and a sort of ghost that appeared late in the night and disappeared early.in the morning. Not so bad, summing up, just a bit overpriced.

If you're expecting Motel 6, you'll be pleased with drabby accommodation, although decently clean aside from bugs/spiders living in the room and squash marks on the wall. Mind you, having the front door, which opens to the outside, actually close without leaving a 1\" gap for bugs and critters would be a tip for management. Especially when there are literally thousands of ants scurrying a mere feet from the doors. You have to plug in your key to turn on lights, so when you arrive at night and want to shut the door quickly to keep out mass armies of mosquitoes and flies, you can't because you have to fumble for the switch. Luckily, very high A/C levels kills off the mosquitoes, except for those who seek respite in the bathroom! And having a fridge is very nice.

Check in staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help. Our room was very big and very clean with a double and single bed and a large bathroom with a bath (great after long days walking around the base of Ayers Rock, the Olgas and Kings Canyon) and was stocked with nice toiletries. The only thing was, the room got quite cold at night and there was quite a large gap under the door to the outside (approx 2 cm) which I think contributed. Dinner was brilliant fun. The DIY BBQ at night is such a good idea, a bit pricey but well worth it as it was such a novelty and great fun. They had a good choice on the menu including steak, kangaroo & fish and an all you can eat salad bar. These facilities were also clean, well kept and run. There was even a one man band/guitarist singing quintessential Aussie songs which added to the atmosphere. The entire Ayers rock resort is quite expensive but worth it for the experience of seeing such remote wonders of the earth as Uluru, The Olgas and Kings Canyon.
