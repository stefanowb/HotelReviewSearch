We stayed for a week. We got on our bus and then they realized there wasn't enough room on the bus for all of us so our friends and us went on a seperate smaller bus. It was an interesting experience! The horn there is used to say hi as well as get out of the way or I'm passing you. Very different! We got to the resort and our rooms weren't ready since the water had been off all day and they needed to clean the room. We sat at the bar then went to eat at the buffet. The food was delicious and very diverse. We got to our rooms and our luggage was there waiting for us which was nice. The rooms are comfortable and the air conditioning worked really well. The tv stations worked most of the time but there wasn't one that had the correct time! The weather was a little rough the first couple days, it rained a bit in the mornings but we still managed to get some sun. My husband and my girlfriend's husband played beach volleyball every day. It was great. I played a couple times and most people were very curtious and fun-loving...a few were obnoxious and bossy but hey, you just choose to ignore those people. We did the catamaran and the sea kayaks and that was really fun and free. We went on one excursion, the Marinarium snorkeling with the rays and sharks. We LOVED this excursion! The service was friendly and they got you dancing and involved in stuff on the boat. If you want to do any shopping on the beach stay away from the right side...they try to rob you blind! Julio on the left side and the people at Nicole's Shop were reasonable and helpful. They take American traveler's checks at Nicole's. We ate at the steakhouse twice and the Italien twice. We had no problems with reservations but we were pretty flexible as far as when we wanted to go. The food was very good but I prefered the Italien. The wings at the steakhouse were also good but the ribs weren't that good. The buffet was also very good and diverse in the selection even for breakfast. Fresh fruit and juice every morning, omelets to order, and all kinds of Dominican food. The service was excellent and friendly and the same people worked there moning, noon and night. They are definitely a hard working group! The only negative thing we found was that prople smoked everywhere! Now, we live in a country were it's smoke-free pretty much everywhere so we are a little spoiled but even in the restaurants while we were eating people would light up. It was hard to find a spot where you weren't inundated with cigarette smoke. If they had a non-smoking area in the restaurants and in the lobby it would make a world of difference. If people want to smoke, i don't have a problem with it...I just don't want to eat it with my meals. Other than that and a few rude Europians who stand in your way on the plane while you're trying to watch a movie, it was a great experience. If you can stand the smoke, I would highly recommend this resort but if you can't, stay away.
