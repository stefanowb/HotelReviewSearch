Rating number 1#, Pounamu Apartments lived up to EVERY expectation. The apartments were amazing, very modern, clean, yet warm and felt like a home. We loved it so much that we opted to 'stay in' with the gas fire, DVD, and surround sound for an important date rather than go into town. As a well travelled couple, the mountain views from the apartment and walking into Queenstown has to be one of the greatest sights ever. We also found the distance to town allowed us to do everything we needed to do without a car (incl. skiing). The cherry would have to be the every helpful and gracious staff.", "title": "Apartment and views even better than the photos!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TravellingBee32", "date": "August 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37339902}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "I've stayed here twice before and both times were perfect.

Loved the fireplace and big tv! Plenty of heating that keeps you nice and warm and the kitchen was great for cooking meals. Computer and free internet was a plus. Only a couple of minutes from town centre where there are plenty of restaurants, bars and shops. The perfect place to relax after a big day on the slopes! Very friendly staff as well.
