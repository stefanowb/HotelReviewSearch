These are budget accomodations, and therefore are not beautiful. Note there is no longer a night club there, so it was quiet and relaxing. The management seems to understand keeping everything functioning is important. This was fine. But every patch in the wall or ceiling was left as is without painting over to make it blend in again. The jacuzzi doesn't work. The pool on the roof could be beautiful and the view is great, but it is plain. The staff was very nice. There is everything you need around you. If you like visual appeal, you will be disappointed. But if you are fine with a clean, spacious room, you will feel like you got a bargain.", "title": "Not luxury, but a decent stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "bakphoenix", "date": "July 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 166572528}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled solo", "text": "I chose this hotel because the site said it had a spa.

The open plan design means that the hotel corridors are open to anyone who wants to wander in and the room locks are not secure enough... no dead bolts.( Some rooms have glass patio doors with one lock, others have flimsy wooden doors with one lock ..( metal keys not plastic ). I experienced a child running up and down the corridor outside my room, screaming and screeching loudly at 11 p.m. at night. I had a couple of bugs in the room ( no idea what they were - not roaches or crickets ...dark brown and an inch and a half long), no hot water at the bathroom basin, a dirty bath mat, a huge crack in the glass coffee pot, shabby room ( peeling plaster on ceiling),etc. Yes, it was cheap($44.00 a night ) but you would be better off spending an extra $12.00 a night and staying at the Best Western,( which I did for 2 nights), which is cleaner and newer, has a continental breakfast,better security,great desk staff, a decent bar /restaurant overlooking the ocean, and throws in a couple of free margueritas.", "title": "Horrible bed", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "NurseKathy", "date": "September 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5833301, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 price", "disliked": "\u2014 bed/ no hot shower"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Think Twice BEFORE You Stay Here", "text": "The office staff were polite and helpful and provided a wake-up call when we asked.
