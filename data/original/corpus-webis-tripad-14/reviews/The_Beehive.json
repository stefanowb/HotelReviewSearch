Seedy district but we knew that and it was quite safe. Stayed one night at another of the apartments the Acacia again fine but no dining area so not as friendly a set up. Also stayed twice at the Beehive itself just great. All very very clean, very helpful staff. They give you an info booklet that saved us time and money, like our day trip to Orvieto also you get a map with the way to the apartments.

The apartment was nice but no toilet paper, the internet access didn't work and it was in a very bad area!!! The apartments are on the other side of the tracks from the hostel so to get toilet paper or anythign else you have to walk many blocks to the hostel. To register, you leave the terminal, go to the hostel, pay, go back through the terminal and fiund the apartments. Okay, not so bad if you have a couple of hours to waste after a long trip to get there and want to rest..... But the kicker is that when we went to sleep we were eaten alive by bed bugs!!! Let me tell you, it's not like a little bite, they suck your blood and we were itching for a week! Nice. Really enjoyable. I contacted the owenr of the hostel and he said they have had trouble in the past with bedbugs but they had taken care of it and we must have been mistaken. Yeah, I'm mistaken about having bug bites all over me. I cancelled the rest of our stay and had to fight for our money back because they refused to take our cancellation because of lack of notification over 24 hours. Sorry, I wasn't notified that I would be the meal for their bugs. I finally got my money back because I used my credit card and I requested a chargeback. Yeah, they fought and kicked and complained to my bank but in the end they lost.

Upon arriving in Rome and walking through The Beehvie's sketchy neighborhood, we were not expecting much (and were actually considering changing our reservation) but thankfully, the hotel/hostel is everything described on TripAdvisor and The Beehive's website, and MORE. The thick garden wall and security door provide safety in a truly questionable neighborhood, the staff is helpful and friendly, and the whole feel of the place is trendy and fun! We stayed in the dorm room, which I was hesitant about at first, but everyone was polite and quiet, and it ended up being a great way to save money. The highlight of The Beehive was certainly Francesca's cafe' downstairs. The food was tasty and healthy, and Francesca facilitated helpful and informative conversation among the guests. We made some new friends and got lots of travel tips. Don't miss her cafe', even if you don't stay at The Beehive. Yum! Our only concern was the lack of air conditioning.

Although it is very convienient to the train station, we had trouble finiding it at first, Roman street numbers aren't exactly visible or in order-just look for the clock that says \"Enjoy Rome\" and you are close. The facility itself is nice, marble floors and big sink in the bedroom. A kitchen on the lower level, plenty of bathrooms/showers. A absoultely priceless guide on local restaurants/sites/scams/etc, big fluffy towels and some of the best handsoap ever were provided to us. Our only complaint was that it was loud. The hotel is one part of a large apartment building and you can hear everything that happens in the courtyard all night long. Sound travels very well in the hallways too and we could hear whenever anyone walked by or was talking in the lobby. There is also a buzzer to let guests in and we heard that all night long too. We aren't light sleepers either. However, that is my only complaint. If I had some earplugs and Ambien I would have been a happy camper.
