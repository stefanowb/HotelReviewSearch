I have to say that I loved it! First, the front desk clerk, whose name I did not get, was extremely polite and friendly. She was also the front desk clerk upon checkout. Since I got to Long Island early, they let me check in at 1:00. I requested a first floor room and got it. The room was extremely immaculate. The shower curtains looked brand new but I knew they had been washed as they smell like that fresh clean laundry smell. I was in room 117, which was near an exit, making it convenient to my car. The room also had an LCD TV that was either 32\" or larger. Although the hotel is not new, the room felt new. I absolutely loved it. It was also quiet, but you do hear when someone runs the water, but then again, send me to a place that you can't hear a thing. The hotel also has a movie theater within walking distance, a Chili's restaurant and a Charlie Brown's.

The hotel is located within an area flanked by several restaurants (Chili's, Charley Brown's, Wendy's) and the large Island 16 movie complex. It is a little tricky to get there but with a GPS it can be done. The hotel is four stories and has been kept up quite well. The one bedroom queen suite I stayed in had been recently remodeled. It consists of a sofa bed, separate bedroom area, and two tvs. I slept well every night I was there and there was no noise in the halls. The kitchen is somewhat reduced from other Residence Inns but still doable. The front desk staff are generally very helpful. One older lady with short blonde hair was particularly helpful in directing me to some of the sites in the area. They have a small business center with a free computer that functions well. The fitness center is small but up to date and seldom was crowded when I was there. The breakfast buffet in the morning consists of a wide variety of selections and different forms of eggs and sausages were available every night. On Tuesday and Wednesdays they offer a free dinner which consists of some pasta, meatballs, salad and soda. For tightwads like me it hit the spot and they kept filling the entrees often. Housekeeping staff on the third floor far end where I stayed was more than helpful and did a great job tidying up the place. The rate for the time I stayed there was $ 144 for a single person which is high by national standards but reasonable for the area.
