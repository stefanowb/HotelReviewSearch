The breakfast was lovely, homemade cakes and jams were yummy, although very sweet for us at breakfast! The owners were very friendly and helpful with restaurant reservations and directions to the beach. The room was fine, big enough and the bathroom was nicely decorated, we were only given one towel though so one of us had to have a soggy towel to dry ourselves on both the nights we stayed :( the owners were so nice we didnt like to complain, we just hoped they would give us two towels the next day, bute alas they didnt. Small niggle, but still attention to detail is important in a small business. If I was every to go back to San Teodoro I would stay here again. Although the beaches werwe beautiful around the area, you need a car to get to them, plus we were not bowled over by the modern feel of the town, I love old towns so was a bit disappointed by the feel of San Teodoro, if you are looking for lovely beaches though this is a great place to come!", "title": "Nice little hotel", "user": "Louis-Eric T", "date": "June 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164439450}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very friendly owners.
