Harborside was good for this. It certainly wasn\u2019t luxurious, but we didn\u2019t pay for luxury. The room was large enough. It had a second level loft with an additional bed and TV. We didn\u2019t need this, but we chose to pay a few dollars more to be on the highest floor. The bath had just enough space. It could use another shelf and a towel rack/ring next to the sink. The staff was very friendly and helpful with a can do/will do attitude. One gentleman took time to write out a full page of complicated directions for us. The continental breakfast was a little better than expected. A nice touch was the cinnamon French toast (you could reheat in toaster) with maple syrup, hardboiled eggs and ham. The breakfast room was cozy and we felt right at home. Coffee was ready early and available all day. The location is convenient and there is plenty of parking. I didn\u2019t see an elevator, so you may want to ask about that if you have trouble with stairs. One thing this inn falls short on is housekeeping. The sink and mirror were covered with splashed toothpaste upon arrival. The bed linens were clean and everything else seemed fine, so I think they just forgot to clean the sink. They also failed to replace the towels they took during Saturday cleaning.
