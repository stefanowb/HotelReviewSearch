I was very nervous about staying there after reading previous reviews and debated what I would take as a result of the thefts. But I was pleased to find a very modern lobby and helpful staff. Our room was pleasantly large and had a safe which we used for free. The room was very clean and the location could not be beat. I would definitely stay there again. We even felt that it was the best hotel we had stayed in during our whole trip. I only suggest that you take what you need and avoid taking too many valuables that may not fit in the small safe.", "title": "Great location at a great price!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MJAMSA1", "date": "July 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8135727, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location", "disliked": "\u2014 All the remodeling being done"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed here for three nights - great location.

The entrance, smart polished marble, the reception staff I met were very helpful. The lifts worked and the room (the basic double) was clean and tidy although I have to say the bright avacado coloured bathroom suite took a bit of getting used to. It's plus and minus is it's central location. Near the bottom of the Ramblas and at the front as I was there was some noise. However double glazed double doors inside the shutters kept that down to a minimum. At the far end of reception, away from the entrance, a set of luggage lockers are provided which will fit a large suitcase for 2 euros. I think this is better than dumping the bags in a room which nobody supervises.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "DaveSKeighley", "date": "January 24, 2007", "id": 6686994}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "No \"Welcome\" no \"goodbye.

The other group that was with us had rooms with no windows i.e. no air and the air con wasn't much better in their rooms.
