We spent most of our time in the pool area that is very well laid out. The pool is a split level with a smaller kids area on top and lower level for the adults. We never had a problem getting a chair and just really enjoyed the atmosphere there. They played background music and the pool staff was always accomodating. I can't say much for the restaurants except the Plunge which is the pool side bar, we ordered snacks most afternoons. This is a resort and items on the menus are pricey. Most evenings we went into town to enjoy the local flavor and many great authentic mexican restaurants. I would recommend Mi Nudito off of 6th and 22nd.
