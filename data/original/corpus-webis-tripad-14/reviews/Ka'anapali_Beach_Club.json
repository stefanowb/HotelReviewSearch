For a pricey ocean view room, we got less of the ocean and more of the patio/pool. The room was large; however, the furniture and carpeting were pretty worn out and dirty. The kitchenette was a nice feature, but we couldn't really use it because there were too many roaches. The breakfast buffet was okay, but the food was a little on the pale side (not very appealing). Otherwise, everything else was fine. This was the third time I've been to Maui. Unfortunately, this resort fell short of my expectations.", "title": "Slightly Disappointing", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "Freestyle99", "date": "January 21, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3022921}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Value, Great Location", "text": "My family stayed in 2 timeshare units January 2-9, 2005. We loved the large suites -- bathrooms are oversized and feature separate toilet room and two vanities - a plus for families. We had a very nice view of the ocean & Molokai from the spacious lanai. Weekly breakfast buffet is extra $85 per suite (up to 4 persons) it was abundant but not extraordinary, consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, pancakes or french toast, pototoes, baked goods, fresh fruits and yogurt, cold cereal. The 60' pool slide was being refinished and scheduled to reopen on 1/9. The daily hosted happy hour from 4-6 pm was a pleasant break before heading out on the evening's activities -- drinks available are Mai-Tais, Margaritas, Rum Punch, wine and beer, no blended drinks -- they offer something similar to party-mix for munchies. We ate one evening at the Ohana Grill which featured burgers, pizza and the like and live music. The staff here seems friendly, professional and service-oriented. When we arrived at the property it was shortly before the published check-in time and only one of our units was ready for us but we were given access to it immediately. Our second unit was ready approximately 1-1/2 hours after the stated check-in time -- we were offered another unit which we declined -- the property furnished us with a $50 dining certificate and waived the parking fees for both our vehicles. There is a narrowish beach adjoining the pool area -- Finding a pool lounge either by the pool or by the beach and some shade wasn't a problem -- towels are avail on loan (snorkeling equipment seemed expensive, though $12/day). Wear reef shoes for the ocean since there is a lot of coral and rocky surfaces --supposed to be good snorkeling spot. Its also a great place to watch the acrobatic kite-surfers when the wind is blowing right. There is a game room located below-grade near the garage entrance-- it seemed remote -- I wouldn't send my kids down there to play alone. The minature golf course looks lame.

My husband and I loved the Embassy! I was a little concerned about going after I read some of the bad reviews prior to the trip. After seeing the hotel and experiencing it myself I am shocked at just how picky people are. We had a great time there. We stayed in a room on the 12th (top) floor. We had a deluxe ocean view suite. The view was gorgeous! We had a view of the ocean, Island of Lanai, the pool, and the countryside toward the mountains. We spent quite a bit of time on the balcony enjoying our view. The living room was great. I admit, the chairs and couch were not of the same pattern but did match in color and were quite comfortable. I can't believe anyone had actually complained about them. The kitchen was also a nice space with a good size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, & sink. We were a bit puzzled at first but the dishwasher since there was no stove to cook on but found that it was nice to not wash dishes on our honeymoon-even if we only had glasses, and lunch plates. The bedroom was spacious and well decorated. Bathroom had a shower stall, two sinks, toilet room, and whirpool bath. We enjoyed every aspect of it. We found the hotel to be quiet. We were right above the Ohana Bar area and were glad that the live music never went late and the bar closed by 10pm. The hotel staff was always curteous and friendly and always willing to help. We went to the guest services desk a few times for advice on trips and were always given excellent information. We were even steered clear of a trip that would have been a total waste. The coctail hour was great! There was live music and even a snack to go with drinks. The bartender certainly did not skimp on the alcohol. Breakfast buffet was good too. They had scrambeled eggs (every day), a meat selection (varied daily), Potatoes (varied daily), and either pancakes or french toast depending on the day. They had a daily fruit bar, cereal, and toast. I enjoyed it every day and found the varied items added the variety I needed but my husband wasnt fond of the scrambeled eggs. I must admit they were a bit runny on certain days but if you ask me its better than having dry flaky eggs. Like others, the birds were a bit annoying at times but it was nice to eat outdoors so we dealt with them. Food was always covered except for the fruit which was in a buffet stand but wasn't exactly wide open. I never saw any birds or bugs around it. We both enjoyed the pool area and I even went down the waterslide! Lounge chairs were plentiful in the sun and shade. We never had trouble finding a place to sit. The sunset torch lighting ceremony was cool. The person lighting torches was always dressed in costume and had no problem posing for photo after photo. The beach area was smaller than the ones I'm used to seeing in Florida and California but it was just the right size. We never felt crowded and found the area was always neat and clean! We had meals at both the North Beach & Ohana restaurants and loved the food at both. North beach was a bit more formal- wait staff friendly at both. My favorite meal was the Hawiian Pizza at Ohana! Traveling on the island is easy, there is one major highway and very few side streets. We traveled the north, west, and east sides. Be aware of road signs as some roads have 90 degree turns. Also note that there are few directional signs to tourist areas. We had trouble finding the \"blow hole\" and the Twin Falls areas but managed to use our senses and the map to get where we wanted to go.

My main problem is with the breakfast. Becuase most of the hotels in the area are open-air, meaning birds can fly in, you would think that the Embassy staff would be sure to cover the food that they serve.....NOT!! One morning when going to breakfast in the hotel the fruit was covered with sooo many fruit flies that it grossed me out and I did not eat any. The last straw for me was shortly after eating breakfast one morning my stomach starting giving me problems and I became very nauseous after eating the eggs and pancakes.

The staff was extremely well-informed and friendly, the public spaces and grounds clean and attractive, and the suites are very spacious. The resort has a much more intimate feel to it than most of the Ka'anappalli resorts. The grounds and pool open right up to the ocean, no walkway or hedge seperating the resort from the the beach. The pool is large with smaller pools for younger swimmers. The beach is narrower here than South Ka'annappalli so the ocean is much closer to the resort. Allthough a timeshare resort they don't push it. A simple no thanks on the first day and we weren't bothered for the rest of the stay. The rooms provided great views to the ocean and the bathrooms were bigger than some other full rooms that we've stayed at. Maui is great at any time of the year but even more enjoyable in the fall, which is considered the off-season.

Wow!! Maui, greatest island in the world. All the reviews are correct that the hotel is showing age and is currently under renovations. We were booked in a deluxe ocean view on the 3rd floor (over looking the pool area and the ocean from our balcony). They had just started renovations to the entire 4th floor. Because of the noise from the construction work, we were asked to be moved and they gave us a great corner ocean front room on the 10th floor. What a view!! We knew that we were not staying at the Hyatt or the Westin, but for the price and the size of the room (huge) we cannot complain. This is an Embassy Resort. For the people who complained in the other reviews, they must have thought they booked at the Westin and ended up at the Embassy? The resort is for families and I would be disappointed if we were on a romantic vacation. We did not spend much time at the room and only one day at the hotel beach. The location is great, just north of the Kanapanalli Resort area where the Westin, Hyatt, Marriott and Sheraton are located and just south of the Kapalua Resort area where the Ritz Carlton is located. We did not want to be in the resort compound areas and the Embassy location is outstanding. Not really walking distance to these resort areas but only a 3 minute drive. Lahania is only 5 minutes or less south. Great town!! Hundreds of restaurants and shops.
