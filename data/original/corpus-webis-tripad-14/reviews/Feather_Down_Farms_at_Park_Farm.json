Our hen party of 23 took over the entire site for a long weekend and Park Farm were accommodating, helpful and understanding. The cabins themselves are rather beautiful and the pet goats went down a treat. I was in \"the cupboard\" and was surprised and delighted to find out that I really was sleeping in a cupboard. Very cosy although we were all cold on the first night. The temperature picked up after that.", "title": "Absolutely Stunning but at a Price!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "S_G_Taylor", "date": "September 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118730010}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "It does take an hour to make a cup of tea/coffee as it is 45 minutes to get the wood burner up to temperature.

Spectacular views stretch out from the foot of your tent away towards the Cotswolds and the Thames. At this point it is lined with weeping willows and lush pasture, a far cry from the brown muddy giant that cuts its way through London and its western suburbs, just an hour and a half\u2019s drive away."}
