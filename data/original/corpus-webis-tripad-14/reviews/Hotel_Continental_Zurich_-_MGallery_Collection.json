The reception staff were nevertheless welcoming and gave me a double room for the price of single. After roughing it at a ski hostel, I needed someone comfortable, and this was a perfect choice. Totally agree with other reviewers about the bed - seriously comfo with loads of bedding. Room is standard 4* design and is quite small - more than big enough for me but for two would be a bit tight. However, dont let that put you off, this is a really nice hotel, especially for the money. The location is good, near the station and a short walk to everwhere.

Unfortunately, the rainy weather of Europe caused almost everyone to become sick. We arrived in Zurich in pouring rain and drove right to the hotel based upon the maps provided. We were allowed to check in around noon which was a real advantage based on our condition. For a low fee we parked the car for the day and went to our room. The room was not large by American standards but was very clean and efficient. We spent nearly 24 hours in the room because of our illness and can say that without doubt it had the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in--Like sleeping on clouds. The hotel provided free wireless and many TV channels to pass the time. The location of the hotel is about 4 blocks from the beginiing of the pedestrian streets where the shops and restaurants are located. The hotel is on a hill but the walk is not hard. Normally we use the hotel as a base to explore a city but in this case it became a home.

Nice hotel. Based on the read in advance reviews we asked for the room facing the backyard side, otherwise there is a noise from the running tramways. Internet is free only if you have your notebook with you. If you use the hotel's computers you pay few bucks for 30 minutes. Shampoo, body wash, gel - first 2 days were ok. After that, the service brought the ones that had not the smell and quality we liked - so we did not use it. I do not know whether 2 franks per night is a too small tip or this was just a coincidence. Make sure you book it with the breakfast included, otherwise it will cost you about $32/per person every morning. We were booking several hotels for the trip and everywhere else the breakfast was included so we just missed it here. The hotel clerk said that we booked the hotel via Expedia, and that Expedia do not make deals with breakfast included. If this is correct (I did not bother to check), probably Expedia does it to have the lower prices than the competitors when you submit a search on the search engines to evaluate offers from few sites. The front desk crew was very helpful, friendly and professional. The only thing I would advise them: when they book taxi for the morning to airport, they should know which car came to pick up who. The taxi drivers do not necessarily know English, so whoever jumped into the car first won. And it will not be you if you wait your taxi in the lobby, unlike somebody who enjoys the rain or the sun outside. The things I listed above can be easily fixed, so I think that for us, who spent one day in Zurich and the remaining days traveled to other cities from the main station, it worked.
