The Moon Palace is more secluded than the other Palace resorts in the hotel district. The hotel staff were very friendly and always said hello. You really get pampered at Moon Palace.

Hah ! I almost spit my marguaritta over our lovely guest service (sales woman) employee, Sandra. The whole pitch took about 90 minutes. They give you free gift for taking the tour. We both took the 50 minute massage, which was very good. If we paid for the massage it would have been $120.00 usd. The food at Moon Palace was excellent and the drinks were very good also. Just be sure to pick a bartender to be your bud and tip him a 10 or 20 pesos now and then. As far as tips are concerned, none of the staff expects tips and they never pressure you into a tip. But they do work their *** off for you so I did tip when they did an outstanding job. The beach at Moon Palace is ok. When you come from sub-zero weather the beach was paradise until you compare it to the beach at Cancu Palace. This is the most beautiful beach and the water is a bright tourquise blue. Great waves for body boarding. Our next trip to Cancun will be at the Cancun Palace because of the beach and a bit more lively activity. Xpu-ha Palace is another Palace resort that we will stay at also. Great snorkeling here and a very relaxing and quiet location. Great beach here also. The beach at Moon Palace is still a beautiful beach but don't walk the coast south of Moon Palace. The beach south of Moon Palace is a testament to how dirty man can be. I have never seen a beach so littered with trash, plastic bottles, shoes and other items. It was absolutely horrible. I'm not sure if the Palce resort owns this beach or not but someone needs to clean this up. Make sure you go and see one of the Mayan ruins.

Any later and your def not sitting poolside. A word about the food, we found the food at the moon palace okay, not great, but okay. Almost everything is buffet style which we found acceptable for breakfast and lunch, but somewhat lacking for dinner. They do have two restaurants with wait staff, a steakhouse where we had our worst meal and a oriental themed which we enjoyed very much. Oh, and don't worry about drinks, there seems to be a bar around every corner and the drinks are pretty good (only one kind of beer, draft, what up with that?)

All in all a beautoful resort grounds well kept and staff brilliant Rooms spotless not once did we see any bugs whereas some of the hotels in cancun that I have stayed in you see them often... One more thing that I must gripe about is the lack of control that american parents have over their children at 07:30 in the morning..even the parents joined in one morning running up and down in the corridor and kicking the ball up the wall of our room...So please if any american parents read this and are taking their little ones on holiday to this resort please spare a thought for other holiday makers and do not let the children run through the corridors as if they are in a school playground.
