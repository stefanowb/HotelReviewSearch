In fact, one night, as we came home from dinner, I overheard the couple in the next room arguing as we approached our door. However, once we entered our room, I couldn't hear a thing!! For me, that deserves two thumbs up! Inside, the rooms are nicely designed and very on par in size with an above average American hotel. The free wi-fi access is great (there's a computer downstairs as well).

For 2 people, we only spent a meager $30 USD, including 3 empanada appetizers, 2 entrees, dessert, wine, bottled water and 2 coffees (Note - Cash only, so be prepared). For a unique culinary experience, we found a closed door restaurant called Casa Saltshaker just a few streets over.
