Our room was quite large and the layout of bathroom etc made it appear even larger as the bathroom looks through to the room via a sliding partition that can be open or closed. All the mod-con's are available in the room - 42\" HD LCD TV with plenty of cable channels, one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in for some time - quality sheets, even support mattress etc. Floor to ceiling windows affording a view down the river. The gym/spa/pool area on the 27th floor was well equiped. Many hotels don't pay much attention to the gym area, Crown Metropol has. Plenty of Life Fitness cardio and strength equipment available along with headphone jacks to access sound for the TV or music. Plenty of towels and water available and the view is again through floor to ceiling windows to help pass the time whilst exercising. The pool is quite large and 1.2m deep (4ft) so is good for swimming and for kids. It has an infinity edge and also looks out through floor to ceiling windows. Plenty of deck chairs available to lie on, though the sun is whatever comes in through the windows - this is not an open air pool. The spa/Jacuzzi is quite large and seats plenty and was a nice temp.", "user": "ozzietraveller09", "date": "November 6, 2010", "id": 86211744}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Would recommend", "text": "Just a quick review.
