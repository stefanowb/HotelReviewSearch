The best thing about the hotel is its great lobby - it has recently been re-done and looks excellent. The rooms are not renovated yet and so, do not even come close to being as nice. We stayed for 4 nights and the last 2 days they did not even clean the rooms. There were 4 adults in the room and we went through a lot of towels and when we phoned the front desk about it they said that they were busy but from what I could see there were more cleaning staff sitting in the lunch room than doing any cleaning. We were by the entry to the pool and the first night that we arrived there was a beer bottle sitting in the hallway and by the 4th day it was STILL THERE!! Same with a picnic table beside the pool area - there was a pile of bags and chip containers that sat on that table for 4 days!!! I have stayed in a lot of hotels and I have never not had my room cleaned - I do not think that they ever even vaccuum at this place - there were Smarties on the floor of our room when we got there and 4 days later and I bet if I went back today they would still be there. The hallways looked the same - like they were NEVER vaccuumed.", "title": "Great Lobby Bad Service!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Melster", "date": "September 11, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3895572}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2004", "text": "When we called the front desk about getting some towels and to say that our room was not cleaned someone finally came with some towels but she looked angry that we had asked for some service.
