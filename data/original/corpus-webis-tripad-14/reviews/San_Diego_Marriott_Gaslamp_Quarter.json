My criticisms of this property are with the cleanliness and maintenance of the room items, common areas and room service (food). The bed covers had dark stains in them and the coffee pot was broken. A call to the front desk quickly resolved the coffee pot issue. The room service (food) had good response time, but the food was cold and didn't taste all that great to my wife and I.
