We had a great oceanview room on the 6th floor, a comfortable bed, a clean bathroom, and plenty of towels for swimming. The pool is clean and very well-maintained, as well. If you sign up for their FREE Wyndham By Request Membership on their website, you can request free wine/liquor/cola and snacks to be available on the day you arrive. Also, as a member, you get free Wi-Fi internet access (my husband loved it). We had our requested half-size bottle of Chardonnay, plate of fresh fruit (oranges, apples, strawberries), and 2 free bottled waters as part of the FREE membership. And, as a member, you get a 2pm checkout as opposed to the usual 12 pm. The beach is right across the street. The breakfast buffet had the standard breakfast food (sausages, pancakes, fruit, etc.) for an additional $12/person; kids under 5 are free. Finally, if you are going on a cruise, the shuttle to the pier is FREE. You can valet your car the night before for a $10 or self-park FREE in their gated (i.e. secured) parking garage. They start transporting cruisers at 11 am, and don't charge for extra passengers (beyond 2) as some other hotels do. Upon arrival from the cruise, you wait right in front of the port terminal (just outside customs--no need to walk out in the hot sun) and they'll pick you up and bring you back to the hotel.

We also tried to watch an in room movie and it would not work so we had to call the front desk and they had to fix that. We also took a bottle of water that was sitting with our ice bucket out of the hotel while sightseeing and was charged $4.50 for it.

The pool is fantastic, service is good and it really feels like a getaway. Where else can you get lunch and a beerl poolside for $8? There's a laid-back fun vibe here. Don't bother going to the beach which just isn't pleasant in this part of Galveston. Sunday brunch is a must. Everyone was helpful and friendly. The lobby bar is a fun place to convene late into the night. The room is nothing spectacular but clean and nice enough. Again folks, it's a Wyndham so keep your expectations appropriate and you will be pleased.", "title": "Old hotel", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "sarric", "date": "May 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5145602}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed 2 days at the Galvez before our cruise. Let me just say that this hotel is beautiful. Very well maintained and if you want to be pampered this is the place to go!! We had booked 2 rooms and had requested that they be next to each other, with gulf view. Didn't expect gulf view since those rooms were more expensive. We had arrived at the hotel 2 hrs before check in and was told they would call us on my cell when the rooms were ready that way we could go ahead and leave and explore Galveston. Let me just note that there was always someone there to help with the luggage, open car doors, and the hotel doors ect. Staff was very friendly and willing to help. About 2 hrs later they called to tell me the room was ready. We returned to the hotel and was told we would have 2 city view rooms side by side. Upon checking in discovered we had been split up onto 2 different floors but before I could even say anything the front desk rep stepped in and fixed it. Not only fixed it but upgraded us to a gulf view!!! (for 1 room that ended up across the hall from the other room) Once in our room (there small but hey this is an old hotel) we were very happy view was beautiful (6th floor) and room was very nice. The bed was to die for the best sleep ever!! My best friend needed a fan to sleep at night called the front desk said they would send one up. They called back to say they had sent someone to Walmart to buy one and it would be up shortly, and at no cost to us!!! Unbelievable service!!! I was originally told that the roll away bed would be $10 nt charge at check in was told no charge. Also parking for the duration of the cruise was told $10, again no charge. We made good use of the pool bar and the Jacuzzi's were great!!!
