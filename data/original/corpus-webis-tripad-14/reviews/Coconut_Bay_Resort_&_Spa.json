This hotel is clean, spacious, and very tropical. Our room was on the 4th floor, which afforded us a great ocean view. The pools and jacuzzi were terrific, and the ocean, even with the seaweed, is usable. We spent many days under the palapala on the beach, just relaxing. We took a nice walk down the beach where windsurfing and kiter surfing were offered at the Reef. This paritucar stretch of beach was beautiful and without seaweed. The Reef bar was a cozy spot to have a beer and relish in the beauty and tranquility of this beautiful island. We also hired a taxi and took a couple of day trips to the Volcano and Botantical Garden. We also went to Castries and ate lunch at Marigot Bay. What a breath-taking view! Dr. Do Little was flimed here. Coconut Bay is within 5 minutes of the airport, but you would never know it.

There were definite pluses and some minuses as well. The good: the sulphur springs/volcano/mud bath excursion was an amazing once-in -a-lifetime activity that is a must-do! the drinks are free AND really strong which doesn't always happen at an all-inclusive resort. Nice clean rooms, lots of food choices, beach grill was excellent, waterslide and lazy river were superfun, upstairs lounge area with beds and disco were nice to have around. Make SURE you get a cab to the LIGHTHOUSE on the mountain near the resort- it's not advertised, but we heard thru word of mouth, and it was the most AMAZING views we have ever seen in our lives- we got amazing pictures. The bad: it rained a lot in January which became very frustrating, when it wasn't raining, it was cloudy and not the warmest (esp with the atlantic ocean breezes), the beach was very subpar since it was on the Atlantic side- seaweed galore and certainly no crystal-clear waters, driving around the island is a nightmare even if you don't normally get motion sick- every road is super windy and right on a cliff. No real entertainment. Also, there weren't enough people at CBR to go on certain excursions so, although advertised, we were unable to go. We had to book our own cab (which was actually cheaper) so don't book thru the reps at the hotel- it's cheaper to pay a cab driver to take you where you want. While the Italian restaurant was good, the Asian one made me vomit all night- be careful!! Bottom line: if you are looking for a perfect beach, don't go here.
