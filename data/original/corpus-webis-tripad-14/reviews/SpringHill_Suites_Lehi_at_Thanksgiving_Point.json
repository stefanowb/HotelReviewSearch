The room was a very good size and was more than comfortable for a weeks stay. The services in the area were limited with a very small choice of restaurants close by. There's no restaurant (other than for breakfast) at the hotel so a car is essential to get out of the area and find other things and with American Fork and Sandy 10/15 minutes in either direction you're not far from a world of choice. The reception staff were most helpful and friendly, very welcoming. The area is very exposed to the elements so wind is a daily occurrence, made to feel even worse when there's snow. Really good hotel overall.", "title": "Good for a business stay", "user": "Russco2000", "date": "March 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 125996248}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012", "text": "Dont expect anything much different at this SS than you get any any other...it falls right in line with the others. The location is nice as it is right next door to Thanksgiving Point. It is a Nature type place and they have a pretty good Deli type resteraunt to make up for the lack of lunch or dinner available from the hotel. Also has a movie theater (8) nearby. The access has been re-routed and it is harder to get to off of the interstate now so know you will have to make several turns to get to the hotel now. Rooms are clean (did find a hair in my tub though...my pet peeve!) and well appointed. Standard SS furniture and a good size LG flat screen shared by the living room and bedroom areas...36 different channels to watch. Standard shower head you get at most Marriott properties. Towels are rather small and thin...took two to dry me off fully. Only soap, shampoo, and conditioner provided. No lotion or other items like cotton balls or q-tips in the room. Front desk people are nice enough and the market is small but well stocked for its size. Prices are more than down the street at the gas station but within what I expect to pay for the conviniance.

It was a good hotel it almost all areas. First, the pros. I was very please with the breakfast. It was a good variety and better than the average hotel breakfast. The staff was extremely friendly, and lastly, the hotel was in a great centralized location. The cons: There were really very minimal cons, neither of which would prevent me from staying here again. First off, my wife and I stayed on the third floor in the back of the building. I don't know exactly WHY but for some reason they decided to light up their back parking lot like a stadium. On the third floor, the lights come RIGHT into the room, which cause the room to be overly lit up. Which made it a little hard to sleep. The other two, are that 1 it was really hot in the hotel (easily fixed with some AC) and the hallways were really small.", "title": "Good Hotel with minimal drawbacks", "user": "Vinnie H", "date": "January 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122763877}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "None of the cons would stop me from staying here again", "title": "Excellent Extended Stay", "user": "Jrudi", "date": "January 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 122473984}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled solo", "text": "I wanted to spend the weekend at a local property as a getaway, and found the Springhill Suites more than adequate.
