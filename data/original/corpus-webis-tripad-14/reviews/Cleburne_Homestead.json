The location is a little out of town but its not difficult to get around the city by car. Its also close to MONA which is a must - even if you are only in Hobart for a short stay. The host was wonderful - informative and welcoming - what more could you want? We also loved the breakfasts by the fire in the large dining room - sumptuous and healthy to boot! Overall we enjoyed our long weekend there and liked the fact that we were in a farmyard setting rather than in a characterless high rise hotel or apartment. Another advantage of the location was that we explored more of the city than we would have if we stayed in the central touristy area.", "title": "Something a little different", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CiaraB", "date": "August 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137982865}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a wonderful stay at Cleburne.

We recently stayed 2 nights with our 2 children 9 & 12 and as the property is set in beautiful grounds with alpacas and geese, chooks and of course Mitilda the dog so the kids were always occupied. We stayed in the cottage and it was delightful with some great pieces of art (Penelope is an artist). Continental breakfasts were delicious and varied each day. If you are very light sleeper the roads are close so the noise might bother you a little but take ear plugs if you are a light sleeper as it is definetly worth staying here. You will need a car but it is not far to Hobart central and is far enough away to enjoy the rural outlook.

With four couples we enjoyed having \"the Cottage\" to gather together where David and Penelope lit a fire for us each afternoon. Penelope and David are the ideal hosts, very welcoming and informative and interesting to talk to. Continental breakfasts were varied, hearty, fresh and delicious. The only drawback is that the large rural property is surrounded by busy roads but the noise seemed distant and visually it did not detract from the setting as the the roads were hidden by greenery and far enough away not to be intrusive. If you are very light sleeper the road noise might bother you but it didn't bother me.Tranquil setting with the attraction of living in an historical building. Something out of the ordinary.
