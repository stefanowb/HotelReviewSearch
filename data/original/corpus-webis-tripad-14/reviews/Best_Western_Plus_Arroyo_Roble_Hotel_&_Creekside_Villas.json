Having two wing-backed sitting chairs is a bonus as so many hotel rooms have one chair or mayb e a straight back desk chair only. The gvrounds are very nice and the pools are not too crowded. The view of the entire Sedona area is breath taking! We used the laundry facilites (in the building next door now - as they were on the ground level in the hotel main building on our last visit). Only one dryer was workinhg so this took much more time to do a couple loads than it should have - but the facilities are open for use 24 hours. Again the breakfast is a very nice bonus. Also enjoyed that coffee was available in the lobby all the time. Will for sure saty here again in the future! This time we were facing the fountain on the ground floor and people would walk past the room and could see right in the window. We all agreed that the location of the room was convenient but if anyone was changing they had to be carefull or go into the bathroom (toilet & tub room).

The perfect value for anyone, especially families with children, who could explore the creek at their leisure. The villas are also for rent...great for a family.

This is our third stay at Arroyo Roble, and it just gets better and better.

There's free use of the resort health club, indoor/outdoor pool, etc., etc. There are beautifully shaded areas (which I personally enjoyed while my husband used the pool and hot tub). The location is fantastic -- we didn't have to use our car ... we could walk all over uptown Sedona to great restaurants, art galleries, shops, and the Pink Jeep tour that we love. I can't say enough about our stay. Four nights wasn't enough for my husband and me. The staff was great too ... always pleasant and very accommodating.
