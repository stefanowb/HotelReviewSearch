The hotel in and of itself is resting on its laurels, I feel, but I specifically wanted to review the High Tea at the Palm Court. For $50 AND the reputation of the Plaza, you'd figure the staff would be falling all over themselves to tend to us but I actually had to find a waiter, to tell him to find MY waiter, to bring us more tea. Tea should have been endless and freely flowing but apparently that was too much to ask. The accompanying treats were fine, the tea was delicious, and the room quite grand although showing its age a bit (and the accompanying pianist was playing \"Zombie\" by the Cranberries, an odd choice) but the lack of attentiveness in a relatively small room that was half full was obvious and really, shameful. We were never asked how everything was, no water refill, just no check in. I am surprised it is allowed to continue, I would never be allowed to do my job that poorly. I would cut them slack if it was busy, and I'm not a restaurant snob but my waiter was just never in the room. But PS the men doing the bussing of the plates were personable and friendly.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PaulaRuth", "date": "November 18, 2012", "id": 145663115}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A Wonderful Way to Spend an Afternoon with Friends", "text": "My girlfriends and I had Tea at 2:00pm on a Friday.

Illy coffee is excellent, and offered with skim or whole milk or half and half. Drinks are pricey at $21 for a bloody Mary with a jumbo shrimp in a Tom Collins glass (tall thin glass - I would guess with ice, it's probably about a 6 oz drink). Other drinks are similarly priced. A bread basket is offered with a variety of fruit breads, which are very good, and included a dinner-sized crusty roll that was tough and impossible to chew.
