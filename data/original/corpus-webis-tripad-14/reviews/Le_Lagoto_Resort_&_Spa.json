The staff will still set up a meal for you on the deck even if the restaurant is being used for a reception.

But from what I could see Le Lagoto was far superior to the Savaii Lagoon although it does still rate quite highly. Admittedly I did not see inside the Savaii Lagoon rooms but from the outside they look like old fibro shacks you would find on the river in Australia. Whereas Le Lagoto has an actual resort feel to it. The deciding factor for me was that Le Lagoto had air conditioning but I was so pleased I chose as I did, there is absolutely no comparison.", "user": "neoberi", "date": "October 26, 2013", "id": 182504421}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Location is everything", "text": "The breakfast are a very high standard.
