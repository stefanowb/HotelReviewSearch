I recommend that amount of time to be able to take a 30 minute ferry ride to downtown Nassau to check out the straw market. The rest of your time should be used, and rightly so, exploring the Aqautic life exhibits and other hotel activites. The hotel grounds are so large that it would be impossible to see it all in one trip, they offer so many excursions and activities that you never really get the whole experience. When at at Atlantis I suggest that you go to the excursion booth and have a swim with the Dolphins at Blue Lagoon Island. The ride over and back is lengthy but well worth the wait as the dolphins over there are wonderfully playful, and well trained. The food is the only objectionable flaw on the whole. It is pricey so beware and make it worth it. To breakaway from the pricey food at the resort go down to the Excursion Booth and book a dinner on a Viking ship only 5 minutes away at the Nassau Marina. The food is wonderful, and the culture the excursion offers is once in a life time. The crew definitely makes you feel relaxed and in the Bahaman feel. Only eat at the predator's lagoon to see one of the main aquatic exhibits underneath and the gorgeous painted ceiling. The Predator's Lagoon's building is a wonder in itself, shaped like a giant shell help up by seaweed covered pedastals. Food there is pricey, and it is your basic soup shop food. The Atlas Bar and Grill is probably the way to go. The food is wonderful there, and only a short while away from the ice cream shop for kids and located in the casino for adults. The rooms in the Royal towers where we stayed are absolutely made for royalty. However in getting a room with a view of the ocean and expecting panaramic beaches and such you will probably be disappointed and end up wishing you had paid less for a regular royal room. The beach view is a bit industrial and has a gym right next to it. The artwork such as the Chihuly glass sculptures and the murals on the ceilings are awe inspiring. The casino offers a thrilling experience for anyone willing to spend a buck or two. The pools and water slides of the Mayan Temple will leave you wanting to ride it again and again and again though the line is lengthy. Atlantis is simply in a league of its own when it comes to regal hotels, beautiful wild life, awe inspiring art, and an experience that you will remember all your life.", "helpfulness": 26, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 25, 2005", "id": 3402654}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "We just returned from our stay at the Atlantis for April vacation, so I am writing this while it is fresh in my mind. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate our vacation as a 5. We stayed in the Royal Towers. I had heard such great things about this hotel and how beautiful it was, and this was all true. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and there is so much to see around each corner. I was also told it was very expensive there, but I had no idea how expensive! I have travelled quite a bit and am not afraid when things cost $$$, but this was ridiculous! Nothing was included in our rates except for that 15% gratuity. You have to pay $15 per person per day to use the gym facilities which is not right. The paddle boats, etc. that are located at the beautiful lagoon are extra - I believe it was $45 for 30 minutes. A large bottle of water was almost $5 at one stand and $6 at another! One cheeseburger at the grill was $9. I got a grilled chicken sandwich for $8.50 which was comprised of a piece of chicken the size of 3 fingers on a hamburger roll. No tomatoes, no lettuce - nothing! We purchased the Modified Meal Plan, but the choices of restaurants was so limited, we only used it for 4 dinners. We did use it for the breakfast buffet which was okay, but we couldn't get a decent cup of coffee one day! You'd think a 4 star hotel could give you at least a decent cup of coffee. I did get tired of my feet sticking to the floor in front of the fruit station! And on the days you didn't want a huge breakfast, you couldn't even get a free cup of coffee from the continental breakfast! The staff was friendly, most of the time. I did have to call housekeeping because I was sick of looking at the room service tray that was left beside our door for 2 days!! And it wasn't even ours! I tried to call the front desk and/or dinner reservations - I eventually put the phone on speakerphone because it must have rang for 10 minutes straight with no one picking up at the other end - and that is no exaggeration!
