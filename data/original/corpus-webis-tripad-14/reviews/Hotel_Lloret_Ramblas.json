Had absolutely no problems. Hotel is older but had an updated bathroom that was probably the cleanest I've seen anywhere.

We had a balcony room that overlooked Las Ramblas -- if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs, this is not a quiet place and the older door doesn't do much to muffle the street sounds. But if you want a truly fantastic vacation moment (like I did) the noise is worth it just to stand out on your little balcony at night and watch the river of people flowing by below. Really beautiful. Super great location, within walking distance of the cathedral, Barri Gotic, the ports, restaurants, shopping, most of the Gaudi highlights including Casa Battlo, La Pedrera, Palau Guell (although Palau Guell is closed until Dec 06).
