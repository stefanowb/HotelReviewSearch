Hotel was wonderful, location is great for walking to both Lamier Square & the 16th Street Mall. It is right next door to the Denver Performing Arts Center. Staff very attentive to all requests, as they should be at a small luxury boutique hotel. Had a standard room with a queen bed. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom nice with separate shower and tub. Only drawback is that when there are performances at the Arts Center, it can be noisy when they let out. I'm from NYC so it didn't bother me, but my sister who is from Spokane was bothered the first nite by the noise. I recommend trying to get a room on a higher floor to muffle the noise.

I generally appreciate the boutique style attention to detail and personal service. Unfortunately I did not find this at the Hotel Teatro. Upon being given a tiny room at the end of the hall with views of a brick wall and noise and cigarette smoke drafting up to my window from the kitchen below, I asked if I might be swithced to another room (I was staying 4 days, which I thought warrented some consideration). I was curtly told by the manager that since I booked mt travel with Orbitz and was \"given a very inexpensive rate\", he was unable to accomodate my request. I not only found that attitute distasteful but also highly unprofessional. Further, the room I was given apparently had not been used for some time, as the shower/ bath water ran brown when turned on, and there was air in the pipes, causing a spray of toilet water upon flushing and a similar experience with the sink. Not what one would expect in a \"Best of Denver\" hotel. The only further attempt I made to engage the staff was to inquire about a restaurant I'd read about, and I was \"brushed off\" by the concierge who seemed more interested in looking at pictures of his car on the internet. This was not a friendly, warm or accomodating hotel in my experience, and if I return to Denver I will be staying at the Hyatt or the Marriott.", "title": "A cut above the rest", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "themotorcycleman", "date": "October 5, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5913411, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Geniunely good service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, this was a special stay.

Nevertheless, I pressed on, looking forward to the special evening I'd booked and flown three hours for. But lo! Despite my having booked a month in advance and having been confirmed for a special evening theatre package, I arrived to find that despite my confirmation, the room and package I had booked for a special evening present was not available. The receptionist insisted I'd booked the wrong date, despite the confirmation! She grudgingly stuck us in a room so small we had to crawl over a chair to get to the bed. Moreover, it was between two elevators, so we spent a romantic evening listening to the bells and hall noise all night. Being a stranger to Denver, and by then very disheartened, I did not move to the Brown or even the Westin as I immediately should have. There was no attempt to \"make it right\" and the special evening I'd planned was a nightmare. Underline, italicize, boldface that statement.
