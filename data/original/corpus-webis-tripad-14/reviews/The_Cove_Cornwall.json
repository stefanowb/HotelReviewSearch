According to the hotel's standard tariff, the deal for an off-peak break is approximately half the usual rate and on this basis represents very good value for a hotel of this quality. Fact is we would not normally stay at a place like this because of the cost - there's usually a good B&B down the road where you will get much better value for money. That said one has to recognise the availability of facilities one would not get in your average B&B, notably the swimming pool and excellent in-house restaurant.
