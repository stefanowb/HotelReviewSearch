The cookies we received were delicious and available anytime I asked (which was a lot :-)). The room was very comfortable and quiet, as well as spotless. Anytime we requested anything from Housekeeping, it was sent quickly without delay. Also, the TV in the living room wasn't working when we arrived. We were going to let the front desk know on our way out for dinner, but on our way back to the lobby we ran into the Engineering manager, and one of the engineers. As soon as we told them, they were on it right away. I had to go back to the room for something and he was already in there fixing it, mere minutes after we talked about it. We purchased the beach package since we were so close to the beach, and it was well worth it. The staff made sure we had our chairs and umbrella for the beach, and Robin Jill even cleaned the chairs when for us when she discovered that the previous guest had not done so. In honor of my birthday, I received a bottle of champagne with a personalized card, which was just lovely. Hope also recommended the Watermark Grille for my birthday dinner, which was a great choice as they have the best steak and seafood. Check-out was a breeze as well. We were given more cookies for the road and the lady at the front desk that day even printed out our boarding passes for us. I wish I could remember her name as well, but she was very nice.
