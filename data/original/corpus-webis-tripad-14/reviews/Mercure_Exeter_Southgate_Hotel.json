Upon entering our room we were hit by extremely hot air. The air con wasn't working and was so noisy that we turned it off. When we rang to complain about the heat in the room we were advised that the bathroom towel heaters may cause the heat and were turned off at 9 pm but they cold provide us with a fan. We took the small desk fan and opened the window but had to put up with car park noises all night. The location is great and the bed was comfortable but when we checked out we didn't get a smile, or 'how was your stay?'nfrom the reception. Parking is 10 pound upon check out. Also absoultely no free wi fi - not sure this is a 4 star hotel.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "theleavers_03", "date": "September 19, 2012", "id": 140707912}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have found Mercure Hotels to be generally good, and this one was no exception. It is a smart building only 5 minutes away from the delightful area around the Cathedral. A large extension blends in well with the original buildings. Our room was modern and well equipped and well serviced, although it did not have the Espresso machine promised.and we would have preferred a bath to a shower. Car parking was maybe pricey, but ample and so convenient. We had dinner the first night and this was surprisingly good for what is essentially a commercial hotel. Set meal prices were good. Quality and imagination were pleasing. Breakfast was very good on our first morning there, a Friday. However on the Saturday we would have been caught in bid queues had we noat gone early. Food was OK, but demand meant that food ran out and tables were not cleared quickly. Sadly this is a common problem with commercial hotels at weekends although the hotel said they had at least two staff not turning in that morning. Overall very good and would certainly use again.", "title": "Good situation, good parking, good food but too busy for breakfast at weekends.", "user": "Norherner", "date": "September 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 140623422}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I personally like this hotel and the staff were lovely.
