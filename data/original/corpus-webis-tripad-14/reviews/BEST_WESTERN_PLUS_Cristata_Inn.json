Was very clean and spacious - a suite with a king bed and a separate sitting area with a pull out couch, microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker and sink. The room looked like new...carpeting, appliances and bed spread/pillows - ALL very nice and clean. The fridge was quiet. We requested a room at the end of the hall away from the elevator. There was a free shuttle to the casino that ran from about check-in time til 4:00 am! AND...it was a stretch limo...a REAL stretch limo...not just a shuttle van you usually find at a hotel. The driver was a super nice retired gentleman who drove once a week for some extra cash. He was dressed up in a nice tuxedo too. He was very chatty, friendlt, and genuinely liked his job. The only downfalls,...and they were minor - it does serve the casino crowd and well, around 1:00 am, we were awakened by some loud gamblers who just returned from Mohegan. They found their room and we could hear them partying some thru the walls but lucky for us, they passed out soon thereafter. Also, if you aren't up ealry enough to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast which runs til 11:00 am (checkout time); forget it. They stop replenishing the eggs, muffins, etc probably around 9:30ish; so there were just scraps by the time we got there. No big deal, there is a greasy spoon almost directly across the street that a local told us about and they served breakfast all day - as do a couple places in the casino.

Once we finally checked in, we got off the elevator on our floor to an overwhelming and vile stench of cigarette smoke that permeated the entire floor. I am not particularly sensitive to odor issues but the room itself was absolutely uninhabitable. The front desk refused to switch us to a non-smoking floor or room. They offered to send an \"ionizer\" to our room and said this was the best they would do. An ionizer? Seriously? We could not breathe! Apparently, although we had selected non-smoking rooms when reserved online, the confirmation changed our reservation to smoking without notification. We told them that this amounted to consumer fraud, however, they showed zero interest in helping us or accommodating us in any way. We came downstairs to talk with the manager, who appeared to be about 19 years old, and offered no help at all. I have never been treated this poorly by any hotel in America. If you are looking for an inexpensive room near the Sun, do not stay at this tragic establishment. We ended up checking out immediately and we are disputing the charges. Do not stay here.

We were headed to Mohegan to see bon Jovi & mohegan's hotel was unbelievable expensive so we chose the cristata inn. While I wouldn't call this place really cheap, it was worth the money. The front desk staff seemed a little overwhelmed but that could have been because there was a line. The 2 women we dealt with were disorganized & a bit snobby but what did we care, we were there to see Bon Jovi!!!! The room was awesome!! It was huge, lots of room for us ladies to get ready. We never made it to the indoor pool, so I can't comment on that. However, I will comment on how awesome the limo driver & limo ride was. We only waited for like 10 minutes & the casino was literally right around the corner. Be sure if you have to be at the casino for a certain time, that you leave early enough because it may take you up to 15-20 minutes to get to the casino depending on how long the limo line is. There was quite a line behind us. The limo drivers were very friendly and sociable. They seem to truly enjoy their job. Breakfast was medocre. There was plenty of tables & chairs in the breakfast area. Food was just ok. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. And I know my friends feel the same.
