For me, a good B&B has to do two things well. The first being Bed and the second, of course Breakfast. The bed was deliciously comfortable with high quality mattress, duvet and sheets. The breakfasts were outstanding - some 5* London hotels would struggle to match the cooked breakfasts that Mark magically conjures up! So that's two big ticks right there, but what makes this place stand out by quite some margin is the hosts. We could not have possibly asked for anything more given a million years! The Eden family are unbelievably accommodating, generous, kind, incredibly interesting and a real pleasure to stay with. We felt as though we had known them for years! I can't even explain just how fabulous our 2 night stay was! We felt right at home which is why people choose a B&B over a hotel in the first place,but these guys are different beasts altogether! A huge thank you again to Mark, Val and Bertie. I can say with confidence that we will be back!

The dining room has the same great view, but it's easy to forget it once you experience Mark's cooking. Poached haddock, kippers, eggs Benedict, smoked salmon on toasted English muffin...or a beautiful FRESHLY COOKED full English? Life can be so difficult! Mark also does evening meals with enough notice, and although we didn't have one they looked just as good. He also has a really well-stocked little bar-the cold lager was a real winner after a long walk on a hot day and it was great to be able to sit outside with it under the sun umbrella on the terrace watching the river go by.
