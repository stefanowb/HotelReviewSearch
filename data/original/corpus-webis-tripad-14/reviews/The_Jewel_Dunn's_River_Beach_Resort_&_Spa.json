We stayed at Jewel Dunn's River April 15-21st. This was our 3rd visit to this property 1st as Jewel. I have to say that I was a little nervous because I have always stayed with another major resort chain so this trip started a little out of my comfort zone. We landed in MBJ a little after noon on the 15th and had to wait for a few other couples, so we grabbed a beer, found our driver \" Dale\" who I must say was great, and waited for the others to arrive. Once everyone had got in we only had one issue and that was AA had lost a piece of luggage of one of the couples traveling with us. After dealing with that we decided to get on the road one piece of luggage light. The trip to JDR was great. We had are own bus which was nice, made a quick stop at the Jerk stand for a few more beers and some chicken and we were back on the road. When we arrived at the Jewel my concerns were immediately put to rest. We were welcomed like part of the family coming home for Christmas, I could not have been happier. Check in was very quick and we were off to our room. We received a nice upgrade with a great view of the beach,a nicely stocked bar and the room was clean as a whistle. That evening we went to the Managers cocktail party and met Scott the hotel Manager and had a chance to say hello to my friend Sharleen. By the end of the cocktail party we were shot after a long travel day so we called it a night. The rest of the week consisted of hanging out on the beach and taking part in a few of the activities around the pool. We met a ton of great people and many have become very good friends. We took part in the beach party that was set up perfectly and the food was second to none. I must reiterate that after 15 trips to Jamaica I do not think we have had better food than at the Jewel. One other note about the food was the room service. I could not believe how fast we were served in the room. I sometimes wondered if the were making the food in the hall it was to our room so quickly. In the evenings we watched the shows that the resort put on or hung out at the piano bar. Our last day we decided to rent a cabana and relax for the day. I was completely impressed on what a great decision that was, we were served breakfast right in front of our cabana which started the day off great. After breakfast Sheldon our cabana guy brought us a cooler full of beverages with everything you could of wanted and more. We soaked up sun all day and then at the end of the day went and cleaned up and got ready for our private beach dinner that was included with the cabana. I have to say the dinner was way more than I thought it was going to be and Sheldon went out of his way to make sure it was perfect. I would give you more details but I don't want to ruin the experience should you ever do this. Just trust me when I say it was worth every cent we paid. There are so many positive things that I could say about the Jewel that I could type all day. I will close with this. I would have to say this was at the top of my list for trips to Jamaica. The food and service is second to none and if I had to summarize in one word I would say \" rejuvenating \" . The entire Jewel staff went above and beyond so when I returned home I feltl like a new person. Heck it should almost be a campaign for them \" Leave all you issues at home and let the Jewel staff rejuvenate you\":) If you ever stay at the Jewel I am sure you will be very happy and if there is something that comes up that you are not happy with just grab Scott or one of his staff and I am sure they will do everything in their power to make it right. I am so happy we decided to leave our comfort zone and try another resort brand. Thank you Jewel and all the staff for making my 18th anniversary a great one! We will see you again very soon.", "title": "Rejuvenating", "user": "TedandNikki", "date": "May 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 106704417}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was our first vacation at an all inclusive resort, and because of our experience, we would certainly do this again, but will try to be more informed next time. Overall, I would love to give this resort 5 stars, but we had just a few setbacks. First of all, we chose the Jewel Dunn because of the adults only and the shuttle service to and from the airport. After a very long and tiring day of traveling, we had to wait for a shuttle to the resort for over 45 minutes. (very disorganized) The shuttle bus was small and somewhat rundown; not a good first impression of the resort. However, the driver was super friendly and knowledgeable, which really helped, as we had to travel about 1 1/2 hours to get to our resort. But once we got there, it was fantastic. The staff was very welcoming and kind. We found our room clean and comfortable, and the atmosphere so relaxing; we started our vacation. The resort is small, but has a luxurious feel to it. This is what we wanted and needed. All of the restaurants and food was wonderful (we really enjoyed Moonstone the most- the salad bar was exceptional) the entertainment staff was upbeat and fun, (excellent dancers!) and the service was excellent. The staff went out of their way to make us feel very welcome, from joining us for breakfast to fist bumps, smiles, and hugs.

She curtly announced they rang our room around 8:05; we were at breakfast of course and did not hear it.. Had we known that we were to leave at 8:30, we would have been there. I asked if we could take the 9:20 shuttle and she snapped that it might be full and would be too late. She did not offer any other alternative, so we had to take a taxi, which cost us $110. We left around 9:10 and made it to the airport 2 hours before take offl We did not need to take a taxi. Having the shuttle was one of the reasons we booked this resort.

The food was pretty good for an all inclusive. We didn't really care for the Italian restaurant (moonstone), but the Jade was okay after they finally found my reservation (which I made before we arrived mind you ). I almost thought they weren't gonna let us in and was extremely disappointed as it was my fiance's birthday and they had no other openings during our stay. The waitress ended up seating us...I originally requested bubba but ended up being served by Simba?? I don't remember his name but it was still a pleasant experience, he was funny, we had a great crowd with great food! Our favorite restaurant was actually The Platinum which we loved because apparently they aren't as busy as the others. The pizza place was great. Loved, loved, love Gregory, Sara and all the others at the Grill. They really made our trip!!! It was nice to be called by name when we went out and even nicer to share a laugh with them. The entertainment was pretty good, and I loved the beach party, great food! It was nice to buy crafts from the locals...and I loved bargaining prices with them. Despite the beautiful conditions of the grounds the fact is that much of Jamaica is poor and they appreciate and need the business. With that being said, don't be afraid to cross the gate and buy from the locals. They are very nice, especially Bridget :) and have some beautiful handmade souvenirs. We got this amazing eagle from \"Popcorn\". My only complaint was the steady harassment to use the spa services. Seriously I went out of my way to avoid anyone who was even remotely dressed like a massage technician. They went so far as coming out onto the beach and asking you to be serviced.

We got a local Taxi--Cheap Charlie's Taxi's and Tours; Requesting he bring \"21\" (our tour guide :) with him. If your interested, take the shopping excursion and ask around town for him. He's very popular! There is an amazing place in Ocho where fire can be lit upon water; its beautiful and the guide informed us that the water had healing capabilities! Must see. We went to the Ocean Sky line saw the cruise boats coming in, saw the \"local's dunn rivers\" where the excess falls came in, ran into local fishermen who caught a HUGE mariner, all in all we got some great pictures and paid less than half of what the average excursion costs through the resort. Because its owned by locals, you definitely won't hear about it at the Tour Desk!!! We did end up booking the Bob Marley tour and it was sooo amazing. I would suggest it for the younger crowd. And if you have anything against marijuana I definitely wouldn't recommend it as you will be offered it many times during your tour. If you're one afraid to venture off into town fear not!

We had an amazing time at the Jewel . From before we left New Jersey the jewel was helping us with every detail. They have a facebook page that you can talk to other people that are there and have been there plus their amazing staff will lead you in the right direction answering your questions . The hotel manager Scott Robbins is a rare Gem. He is a hands on type of guy that you wouldnt expect to find at such a amazing place. On super bowl Sunday we had a tailgate party that was so much fun we literally had trucks on the beach with the mounds of food served off the tailgates. Scott was there helping his staff every step of the way. So... my review the hotel was very clean never had problem with the cleanliness of the room. Plenty of pillows towels ect. Room fridge was always stocked we preferred diet soda left them a note and we had extra diet soda. Food in all the resteraunts were above average. and their brick oven pizza was the best . and available till the late hours. also had a grill that was opened 24/7. Staff was top notch. entire staff not a bad one in the bunch. they also come around the pool and beach with drinks and fresh fruit.

My husband had a chicken florintine dish that was also very tasty. We had a diamond concierge room, which was well worth it for me. I like to have a room as close to the ocean as possible and requested this as well as the 5th floor, which they gave us. We opened the doors or had a drink on the balcony and felt like we were on the beach even when in the room. You could see and hear the ocean all the time. There was noise from the pool area, but that didn't bother us. Also, the bed was extremely comfortable! Loved it. I liked the garden setting surrounding the open air exercise room. I enjoyed using the weights and the hot tub. We did snorkeling through the dive shop on the resort for a fee. We loved it. We also loved the complimentary small catamaran/ sail boat rides. They also have kayaks, but we didn't get to that. The only thing that I would have liked was a longer beach.
