But a good hotel is important when the family has been running around the city all day long. The location close to 40th and 8th is convenient for all the main attractions that the city has to offer. Less than 5 minutes to Times Square and a 15 minute jog to and from Central Park. The hotel is located behind the central bus station and this does mean that there are some interesting characters on the street, but by and large, this was not an issue. The lobby is somewhat small and congested for a hotel of this size but the helpful staff do their best to relieve the congestion. The communal breakfast is a bit of a bunfight but we always managed to find a table for the family. The concierge is also very helpful assisting with booking restaurants, cars and attractions but she was not completely au fait with the details of booking a trip to Ellis Island. The free afternoon snacks, beers or soft drinks was a great boon. The rooms are not overly dimensioned but this is NYC! The beds were somewhat soft for our tastes but we slept fine. The rooms also benefited from ironing boards, fridge/freezer and washing machines. Beware that the rooms are not well soundproofed and many conversations and all energetic activity are subject to a public audience in the lobby! The main drawback concerns the lifts which are simply not adequate for a hotel of this size. We stayed on the 13th floor and were forced to use the stairs virtually every day. The longest wait was over 10 minutes at peak time.

He was there to load our bags onto his cart and bring our bags to our rooms. He was in the lobby most of the time that we entered or left the hotel. He always was pleasant and talked to us about what we did or what our plans were. My family and I really liked that. Eddy was the Best. We also had the pleasure of dealing with Daniel who checked us in promptly and was very professional. I could go on and on about all of the staff. They always greeted us with smiles and asked if we needed anything. BEST STAFF EVER! The room was very, very comfortable. The cleaning staff was perfect. Having refrigerator, toaster, stove top, dish washer, etc. was fantastic. Who ever hired the People that work at this Hotel should be commended and so should everybody that works at this hotel. The breakfast and coffee were also great. In previous reviews, i read about the slow elevators. The elevators are not slow. As a matter of fact, there are very quick elevators. The problem lies with the people who push the both up and down buttons when they arrive at the elevators. DO NOT PUSH THE UP AND DOWN BUTTONS AT THE SAME TIME. THIS TAKE THE ELEVTOR TWICE AS MUCH TIME STOPPING AT EACH FLOOR THAT IS PUSH TWICE. If you are going up, push the \"up\" button. If you are going down, push the \"down\" button. This will cut the travel time of the elevator in half. So in closing, I would like to THANK all at the Staybridge for the wonderful stay.
