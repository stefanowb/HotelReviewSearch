We were shown to our tiny room and told it was about a half hour walk into town, what we weren't told was that the road was very busy sometimes with no pavement and no lights. On recommendation from our host we had booked a larger room to find it had one double bed and a child's bed which is not really suitable for 2 single ladies. The decor was circa 1980s and more fitting to a cheap Blackpool boarding house; my knees touched the door when I sat down in the loo and I could not turn round in the shower room and I am only 5ft 2in! There was constant noise from the traffic of the busy road outside. We tried to check out after the first night but were told that we would to have to pay. After some discussion our host said we could check out for the last night but was not at all happy when we told him that 92 euros with no breakfast was expensive for a 2 star hotel (although this hotel doesn't even warrant a a 1 star!).

We stayed with our two small children for four days, in the self contained studio with kitchen, which was plenty large enough for us all, with its own sitting area. With the kitchen you can buy your own breakfast and we really enjoyed sitting in the sun with views of the hills with the kids and not worrying about ruining anyone else's meal! The hotel is near a road, which you can hear from the pool, though not the room, and as others have said the outside decor could do with a bit of tidying up, but somehow this does not really matter, as it is such a convenient and relaxing place to stay, with the boulangerie so near, and Vence so accessible (this is a really beautiful town, I would say nicer than St Paul). We enjoyed the pool, dinner at the tennis club, with kids, and being able to drive around the area so easily. Tom and Ruth were wonderful, welcoming and helpful. If you have a young family I would strongly recommend staying here, and visiting Marineland, and the local beaches (with the one caveat that the sea at Cagnes is a bit wavy for non-swimming small children, we found the bay at Garoupe on the Cap d'Antibes better, the private beaches looked a good place to spend the day if expensive, but get there earlier than us (ie 10am) to secure a place!)All in all extremely good.", "title": "lovely stay", "user": "twoplusonetravel", "date": "July 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 73036520}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel itself is very cozy.
