Great size tub and bathroom. Comfortable beds. I thought my room was quiet, despite other reviews stating airplane noise. Yes, I did hear them, but not as bad as I expected.

I remember the hotel being very beautiful, clean, and respectful; even to a ballroom full of eager youths! Therefore into my adulthood I now return to this hotel with my family whenever we fly in and out of Seattle. The main attraction of the hotel is the inside pool and garden. It\u2019s a beautiful space much like an atrium that all the hotel rooms windows look inside to view. The indoor pool is surrounded by plants, flowers, plenty of lounge chairs, and skylights in the roof which give a great ambiance combined with the pool lights in the evening and night\u2013 a great place to chill and relax before or after a flight! At one time I even thought about having my wedding here poolside. The location is convenient for guests to go to and from the airport especially with the Hotel\u2019s Shuttle Service, but also walking distance to the strip malls / outlet stores nearby. Or just a short, cheap, cab ride to the Sea-tac Mall. The noise from the airport is not loud from here, but during the day if there are large groups of people poolside the noise can echo, but the windows are pretty good at blocking most the noise. We usually make our reservations online. Once there, Check-in was fast, and I will say the hotel is more expensive than others, but this hotel also boasts other amenities like the coffee shop, gym, and the great pool side sanctuary. The beds here are also more comfortable than many other hotels I have slept in around the US!
