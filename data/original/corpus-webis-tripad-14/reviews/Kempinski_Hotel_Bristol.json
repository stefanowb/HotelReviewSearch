The weather was hot and the hotel markets itself as being air conditioned but it is not. It has an air cooling system which is useless in hot weather. The room could have been cleaner and clearly needed updating. The location of the hotel is teriffic. Finally, I booked through Leading Hotels of the World for which I was to get certain amenities. Upon check-in I was coldlly informed that the Bristol was no longer a member of LHW and that I would receive nothing. It appears that the hotel is still a member of LHW so this is baffling.", "title": "Caution!", "user": "Polarine", "date": "September 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 41962226}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006", "text": "Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights so we could visit the German Christmas Markets", "title": "Nice Hotel very well situated", "user": "watty77", "date": "September 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 41104542}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Check in was effortless & the staff very welcoming.", "title": "Great hotel but rooms could be brought up to date", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "globaltruth", "date": "August 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 38805182}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very well placed near all the shops & right on the KU Dam", "title": "Exelent stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SilentDiver", "date": "August 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38430509}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Rooms were a little shaby & could have done with a lick of paint ~ very clean though.", "title": "Great hotel but slightly dated", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "smsUk", "date": "August 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 36807718}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled on business", "text": "I think this is a really lovely hotel, I found the style to be fairly oldfashioned, and the public areas as well as the room I stayed in were 1950s high style rather than 21st century minimalism. The service was good, and the hotel was a comfortable place to stay in the depths of a Berlin winter. The swimming pool and health club area were great and I found all the staff to be extremely helpful. On the downside, my room was small, but tolerably so, as I spent little time in it, the charges for internet connection were exhorbitant at 25 euro per day and although the breakfast buffet was spectacular, it was also spectacularly expensive. The hotel restaurants were also relatively expensive, but they were aslo extremely good, and certainly the cost was no higher than it would have been in London restaurants of similar quality. The Ku'damm also has many cafes and restaurants as alternatives for meals and there is a large suoermarket nearby to stock up on drinks and snacks as an alternative to the minibar. I really didnt like the fact that the hotel followed the German habit of using two single duvets on a doubl bed and the fact that the 'double bed was actually 2 singles pushed together - and not phusically joined so it could and did slide apart.", "title": "Lovely hotel in great location", "user": "seniledelinquent", "date": "March 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 58695096}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Overall a comfortable hotel in a great location.", "title": "Old world elegence", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "amadeaus", "date": "February 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 56663041}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Theis hotel is situated in what was the old centre of Berlin before the waoll came down, near the Zoo.

But the hotel room was tiny, the bathroom wasnt clean, the bed had holes and was dirty, the furniture was worn down and not completly clean, the room didnt have air conditioning, you could open the window since that was too loud, and the room euqipement was lacking good quality sanitary products, tooth brushes, body lotion, sewing kit and a groom where missing! Further comments to the service; it took the bell boy 25 mins to bring our luggage, the concierge didnt have any specific recommendation for bars nor did he know the exact trains going to Alexanderplatz, the bell boys never felt an urge to open the entrance doors, they where rather standing around in the lobby doing nothing, The room cleaning was also lacking 5 star service, e.g. they didnt change the bed linings!
