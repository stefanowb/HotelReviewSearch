It is true that it is located right in front of the beach and 500 meters from the center of Itapoa. It has a nice pool and clean but very simple rooms. That\u2019s all for the positives; I found the owners blas\u00e9s, almost depressed, giving an image of decadence. We felt like they were detached from their role as hosts. They were not impolite, but rather a far cry from the typical warm and friendly Brazilians we have always met. We stayed only one night at a small room in the basement (we were supposed to move up later but we left before). The TV was useless (brokenn antenae), the sheets had holes and there was no hot water. The breakfast was very minimalist, with only coffee, milk, a couple of juices, crackers, slices of bread, ham and cheese and a (not really tasty) cake. In summary, one gets too little for too much.", "title": "Tranquility on the beach", "user": "Pupunhabrava", "date": "July 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 71163635}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "- The beach: Frankly, Bahia and Brazil have beaches that are much, much better than this one. I last visited Itapoa 20 years ago and was impressed by how beautiful and calm it was. Nowadays, it looks more like a mix of an open air garbage dump and a nightclub, especially on weekends. The cacophony of dozens of sound systems playing different songs is unbearable, and the volume of trash left by the public is disgusting. I don\u2019t see the point of being at a beach-front room, unless one wants to listen to a thousand different Ax\u00e9 bands at the same time while looking at a garbage dump. Our neighbors played music very loud the whole day since this is the way people like to have fun over there. In the last 5 or 10 years, Brazilians have gotten into oversized sound systems and loud music in the beach. The time of \u201cpassar uma tarde em Itapoa, ouvindo o mar de Itapoa\u201d is long gone\u2026Add to this the lack of a decent garbage collection service and you have the worst possible nightmare for someone looking for a peaceful and pleasant stay.", "title": "Excellent holiday, directly on the beach", "user": "Irki", "date": "May 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 65510897}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "It breaks my heart but I think Itapoa is a shame to Bahia and to Brazil.
