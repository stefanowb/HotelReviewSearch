And once you get off the train, you have to take the local shuttle bus on the street level (take escalator down). The local shuttle mini bus costs 100 yen and has 3 different routes. Take the Route A. Please have coins ready as they don't provide change back. Once you get on, tell the driver which hotel you are going so he will drop you off at the hotel. Take the main elevator to the 8th floor, follow the sign (by turning right, and taking the escalator up), exit the back door and you will see two buildings. One is the Hakonenomori, and the other one is the Onsen. I know it sounds complicated. But in reality, it's not too bad.", "title": "Great price, beautiful onsen, bit hard to get to", "user": "MissDiZz", "date": "October 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 141721852}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "One major advantage of this hotel is that guests have access to an full service Onsen, which is open to non-hotel paying customers. Because of that, the size and facilities are much better than other in-house onsen. The onsen has separate areas for each gender, and each area has about 6 pools of various styles, as well as a sauna. On another level is their massage and rest area. They provide massage chairs for guests to use, free of charge. Another floor has a restaurant (for non-hotel guests I suppose). Even though the onsen is open for non-hotel guests, I didn't find it too crowded. And when I went late in the evening and early morning, there were times I had one of the pools all to myself at some point.", "title": "Perfect Experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jelligirl", "date": "September 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140275265}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "In terms of the hotel itself, it's pretty average. We booked a Japanese style room. We had to prepare our own beds. We don't mind it as this adds to the overall experience. Food wise, if you have not adapted to the Japanese cuisine, you may not enjoy the taste of the food. However, the presentation itself is top notch. For people who enjoy and have experienced this type of Kaiseki style meal, the quality can only be graded as average (the cooked seafood lacked any flavour).", "title": "So So", "user": "TheSmallTraveler", "date": "May 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 129232591}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We don't speak Japanese and the staff in general speaks very little English.
