The bathroom shower had a moldy smell. The coverlet on the bed was soiled. I know antiques, but these were just very tired and old furnishings. The bed creaked and was uncomfortable.

Also, there is a restaurant downstairs that gets deliveries in between 5:30 and 7am every day except for Sunday. The truck leaves it's engine and cooler running every day and it is exceptionally loud. It turned out not to be as bad as it sounds because it helped us get up early in the morning and beat all of the crowds.
