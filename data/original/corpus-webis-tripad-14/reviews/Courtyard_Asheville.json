Although i would've preferred to stay at the Biltmore Inn. When i was doing my research through Biltmore's website they said that this hotel is only 4 miles to the mansion. I find that quite deceiving because it was clearly more than that. It took us 15mins to get to the mansion from our hotel. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were decent in size. Although it would be nice to have queen rather than double sized mattress. The rooms were clean and the housekeeping did a great job on keeping it tidy every single day. The free breakfast were good, you have a lot of options to choose from. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel like I said is about 15mins to the mansion if youre going that way. But the surrounding area have some good restaurants like Carrabas to name a few, a decent sized mall and a grocery. We had a very relaxing experience and i wouldnt want it any other way even if i can afford to stay at the Bitmore Inn.
