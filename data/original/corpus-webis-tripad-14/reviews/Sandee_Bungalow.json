However when we arrived although the bungalow was clean, it was very small and extremely claustrophobic as all varnished on the inside. Also the entire bungalow smelt like a men\u2019s toilets, so much so we decided not to stay and found accommodation just up the road which we absolutely loved. In our brief encounter with Sandee Bungalow we found the reception lady to be pleasant but the location is quite poor as it is essentially in the entrance of another very large plush resort and quite near the road. All in all an adequate place to stay if you are a student or proper backpacker, not so good otherwise but you obviously get what you pay for!", "title": "Really unpleasant little bungalows, badly located", "user": "John R", "date": "January 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 150249951}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled solo", "text": "This is a superb spot if you want to get away. The bungalow was clean with a clean tiled bathroom. I stayed in 8 & it was nice & quiet. There were tropical flowers all over , a hammock in which to hand & read, & many lovely large butterflies floating around. The owner was fine, helpful & there is free wifi there. In the afternoon, a guy comes with a crepe cart & makes some killer crepes right outside of Sandee's. You can also walk to Bottle Beach from there, but I suggest you hitch out on a local motor boat. Really enjoyed my time there in Surat Thani.
