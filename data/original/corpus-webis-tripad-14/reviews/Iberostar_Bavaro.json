I have been reading these reviews for the past 6 months or so, I read so many reviews - we were initially booked to stay at the Iberostar Punta Cana and then I started to see bad reviews, I got nervous and finally decided to upgrade to the Iberostar Bavaro. I don't know that there was any reason to do that in the end... I saw nothing wrong with the Punta Cana or the Dominicana but I was very happy at the Bavaro. Our arrival was fine - we were bombarded by people that want to take your bags for you. I was forwarned that this was not neccessary but they were extremely insistent. In the end, I really didn't know where I was going anyway so we let someone help us. He charged us $ 5.00 \"tip\" thought it was strange that they would tell you how much to tip but hey... you're on vacation and I didn't need to figure out where we needed to be so we gave him the five bucks. The bus ride to the resort was pretty impressive. It was a HUGE tour bus with tinted windows, wonderful air conditioning and big comfortable seats. A nice surprise. It only took about 25 minutes to get to the resort. Check in was nice and easy. We had a couple of specific requests in regards to our room - I had asked for 2nd floor - Two double beds - near pool / beach. It turned out that they did not get those requests from my travel agent but they had no problem changing our room to meet our requests. Very nice. The pool is amazing - the beach is amazing - the grounds are immaculate - the service was wonderful what else can I say? Everything was perfect. And as far as worrying about the language barrier? I really had no problem - when someone couldn't understand me I would do some charades and everyone would figure out what I was asking about! It was fun. I learned some key words in Spanish and it really wasn't a problem. I traveled with my husband and my two boys ages 11 and 8. The 11 yr old got involved with all types of sporting events that they had - beach volleyball - soccer - ping pong tournaments etc... The 8 yr old fell head over heels in love with the star friends that run the \"Lucy Club\" Shout out to Rosa!! You were amazing... thank you. I would suggest that you invest in a pair of decent walkie talkies. We brought ours and it was a godsend. We were able to let him call us whenever he wanted to leave (which was never) if you don't have this there really is no way of knowing where your child is at any given moment. They change from station to station throughout the whole day so that could be a problem. Our room was great - I personally did not find the hairdryer to be such an issue as people have said but I don't really use it to do a lot either so use your own judgement on whether to bring one or not. I did bring my own but I did not end up using it. Oh one little piece of information that I think is important to pass along is that your sliding glass door to your balcony is tied in with your air conditioning in the room. If your door is not fully closed - your a/c will shut off. There also is no on/off switch for your a/c - it just runs non-stop and there is no temperature control either so don't bother searching the walls for it as we did. We had no complaints regarding the a/c it was perfectly acceptable and you can control the speed of the overhead fan with a switch on the wall by the bed. We had to call a technician because we thought everything was broken when the air would not turn on when in fact my son had not closed the slider properly. PS. The service tech was rather slow getting there but didn't we feel the fool once we were told how it works... Our tour rep at the Bavaro was Hector (with Preito Tours) I can not say enough about this gentleman! He went out of his way (literally!!) to make sure we had a great time. He was honest about the excursions and told us what to expect and which ones are the best deal for the money. We went on the Carribean Festival which was a blast - the bus picked you up and took you to the marina and then you board a huge ferry type boat with two levels - the staff that run this are wonderful - friendly and funny and they put on shows while you are enroute. And then we swam with the stingrays and the nurse sharks and the whole trip lasted about 4 hours. I thought it was a good time (cost us $ 287.00 for two adults and two children) and then we did the Dolphin Island excursion - I went back and forth trying to decide whether or not we wanted to spend this much... $ 120.00 per person regardless of age. Finally I decided I had no idea when we would be taking another trip like this so we did it - my husband went as a spectator (only $ 20.00) and he was able to take all the pictures he wanted from the sidelines. It was fantastic! We had a blast!! Our tour guides for this excursion take you in a speed boat out to the dolphin area and then you get a good solid 1/2 hour in the water with the dolphins. Our guide (Junior... hello Junior!) let both of my boys steer the boat on the way back and they were thrilled with that. The food: I have to say, some of us are pretty picky eaters and don't like a lot of things. If you can't find something to eat here... that's just crazy. You may not LOVE everything - things are very different here, even Coca Cola and Sprite tastes different but it was fine - we had no problems and no one got sick on anything. There is a drink here called Mamawanna - It's sort of like a brandy - they call it the Dominican's Viagra! HA! I find that hard to believe.. if you get into your second one of these you are going nighty night very quickly! It had a wonderful taste though (get is served on ICE it tastes much better) and then only sip it... Other than that I really enjoyed their Pina Colada's and their Banannamama's (frozen) Nice! Our tour rep Hector warned us about the Colada's they use some type of coconut milk and he said it can act as a natural laxative so be careful how many you might consume. The most impressive thing I found here was two things: 1) These people love their job. Not just doing a job, they really truly seem to enjoy it and they work SO long and SO hard. (tip them.. they deserve it) and 2) the workmanship, if you look at how things are made and how sturdy every piece of furniture is it really is amazing, I wish Americans took as much pride in their work as these people obviously do. Ok if there was one thing that I didn't care for I would have to say it was \"vendor\" night. Friday night they had a whole bunch of vendors that lined the walkways and lobby area. I really just wanted to browse around and look at all the different things but they were all so pushy that it made it too difficult to do. I was really sort of dissappointed with that but I also did not want to have to keep fighting to say no. We brought a lot of one's with us for tipping as people suggested and I was thrilled that no one seemed to expect a tip or hang around waiting for one either. It makes tipping that much more enjoyable! Feel free to ask me anything you'd like and I'll answer to the best of my ability. I know I was a little nervous about whether my kids would have enough to keep them busy... No worries - they'll have a ball.", "title": "Heaven on earth!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "jaktyl", "date": "April 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28961339}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Before I visited Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana, I read lots of reviews on this site to get familiar with the hotel and everything that goes with it.

We really enjoyed the events at the pool each day and the entertainment each evening was terrific! The entertainers were sooo funny and made us laugh, even if it was at ourselves! My husband got picked one night to be on stage and be part of the act. To this day he regrets it, but what fun stories we have to tell our family and friends! The videocamera was a great tool to capture the beauty and enjoyment we experienced. I took over 300 pictures because I wanted to bring my whole trip home and didn't want to forget anything. The food was very good and there were too many types to choose from. I bet they do that to make sure they don't forget that there are people from all over the world who have somewhat different food choices during each meal. The cooks were always very friendly and had a smile on their face for each one of us. We chose one dinner to make a reservation for, but truthfully, the buffet dinners were our first choice each night, because we had as much as we wanted and got to pick from so many types. My kids preferred the pizza, hot dogs, chicken, and the french fries. They also had some salad and fruit. I tried a salad that had sliced deli meat in it that I would really like to make at home. The employees went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. It's good to know a bit of Spanish before you go because the restaurant people know little English. We had a blast learning more of their language and teaching them some of ours. The flea market was a one-time visit because they can make you feel bad if you don't buy something from them.

No more than $3/cigar. You'll get great deals on great cigars! The only down side to the beach is the chairs. They do not lay flat. This started to bother our backs when we would lay on our stomach.

Let me start out by saying if Apple Vacation serves your area they do a great job of making your vacation a success, the only thing that all of the all-inclusive vacation I have gone on have in common is that they were booked through Apple. As with any small island airport Punta Cana airport is no big lavish place but they do a good job of getting you in country and re-uniting you with your luggage. Don\u2019t let the baggage handlers scare you, this is a poor country, jobs are scarce, they only charge $1.00 a bag to hull your bags out to the bus, you are on vacation, 4 or 5 bags for $5.00 in 90 degree heat, that is a bargain were I come from. Do note these guys are in a hurry so don\u2019t get on the bus until you see them put your bags in the luggage section of the bus, and by all means do not put you purse or carry on bag with your return ticket , passport, camera, money, etc in there keep it with you, this just makes good sense. The ride to the resort is going to take about 30 or 40 minutes the bus is air conditioned and the driver usually will give you a little information about the country to make the time pass by quickly, you may stop at a couple different resorts to drop off a few guest look the resorts over good, you will be coming back and this may be your next vacation home, also on the return trip to the airport ask the people how they like the resort, most are very eager to tell you what they did or did not like about the place.", "helpfulness": 91, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 3, 2006", "id": 6052488}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "Now to the vacation let\u2019s start with check in, we arrived about noon, about 3 hours before the official check in time, the lobby of the Bavaro is large and beautiful, it has a classic look with out over doing it.

Hats off to Juanita our room maid.....there is a sign in the room that says the mini bar is only stocked every second day....NOT TRUE...try everyday!!! Awesome lady!! She always made sure there was plenty of beer, pop and water. I heard how at some resorts they seem to be a little cheap on the bottled water for the rooms.....not this place. We had more than enough. She was always smiling and greeted us with a warm Hola everytime she saw us. Mater of fact everyone was always smiling and greeting us too. And what an imaculate room...not one bug to be found. I think the only complaints I would have about the room was the hair dryer is cheesy (I brought my own so no big deal) and the TV didn't work when we arrived. But in less than 5 minutes someone was there to fix it. The serving staff are the most friendly warm people I ever met in my life.Special kudos go to Jorge who never ever allowed our wine glasses to go empty at dinner and what a funny guy...so nice to have someone make you laugh despite the bad weather. Also very honorable mentions goes to waitresses Candy and Santa. Candy was ever so gracious to smile, wave and say \"Hola Canada\" for our video camera. She even tought us a few words in Spanish. The animation team had me in tears laughing so hard espeacially when we were playing bingo. My boyfriend thought he had a bingo but didn't. The rules of the game is that if you yell bingo but do not really have one....you have to jump in the pool. So my boyfriend played along laughing and hollering \"But I am Canadian\" while the animation team led him to the pool....they responded by saying in their best english \"and you're still going in the pool....eh\" Hard to explain by typing it in a review...you had to be there. It was hilarious....I almost peed my pants laughing so hard. And speaking of laughing hard my favorite night time show was a comedy story about tribesmen who have to go under a test of strength....inner strength to resist the temptations of a beautiful woman. If you are at this resort in the future, hope they do this show again. You do not want to miss it....it's hilarious, you'll be in tears laughing so hard.

You will never go hungry in this place. Hard to decide which a la carte we liked the best. My boyfriend really loved the mediteranian...he is a big seafood nut and so am I. I loved the cajun..

We listened to very loud rap music during the 30-40 minute drive to the resort. Upon check in,we were given a room w/ 2 double beds. I basically begged for a king & our request was granted when we rechecked after returning from lunch. No other requests for room accommodation were made-no ocean view, no non-smoking room.The room was dark, musty & there was no control as to the comfort level of the air conditioning. The ceiling fan over the bed was either too slow(ineffective) or too fast(causing a huge draft on you while you slept). The oversize shower stall was nice, however, there was a large collection of hair on the drain & small spiders in the corner. My husband stepped on a small piece of glass that was on the bedside throw rug. The room safe did not work. The room refrigerator was not cold so of course, the drinks were not. Finally, three people showed up simultaneously to correct these various problems after I made several continuous calls to the front desk, but alas, no one spoke English, so I spent another 15 minutes on the phone with the front desk reexplaining the problems to them while they then interpreted to the appropriate personnel. We went to the pool to the swim up bar. At 3:00pm, the pool was filled with debris, leaves, dirt, hair etc, & there was several long hairs on the bar where we sat. The drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic were horrible @ best. One can make a better pina colada using a grocery store mix. There was either minimal alcohol or watered down drinks which is why there probably were not any out of control, inebriated people there!! The food was average/below average for a \"resort\". At any of the buffets,indoors or out, it was not uncommon to see flies randomly landing here & there on all the food. There was little in the way of American food as we know it. The hamburg tasted very odd. The buffet was very different style food, jellied, spicy,or pickled. Even the desserts were not worth the calories. The fresh fruits were delicious, but we ate too many carbs due to the lack of options. Even at breakfast, the french toast & waffles were soggy. The steaks & grilled chicken at the outdoor luncheon grill was excellent & the cheese pizza was surprisingly good. The gourmet restaurants were delicious, but you are only allowed to go to them based on the number of nights you are staying at the resort-ie, a 4 night stay allows you to make a one night reservation for one of the restaurants. People from the USA were the friendliest of the tourists, the others were rude & didn't mind if you knew it. Was there anything good about our trip?? YES! The weather was incredible-no humidity, sunny & in the 80's. The ocean was an enormous pool of layers of turquoise & warm. You did have to put a towel on your chair by 6:30-7:00am if you wanted a\"hut\" to be out of the sun which was rather intense. I had 2 spa body wraps & two 30 minute back/shoulder massages all for the price of what I have paid at some resorts for just 1 massage! A great bargain. The most disconcerting thing that occurred was that on the morning we left, we went to breakfast, leaving our 2 checked luggage bags outside our door as instructed, placed the do not disturb sign on the door, closed the curtains & went to breakfast. My husband left a $10 bill on the table as a tip for our stay. When we returned, our room was the way we left it with one exception-the money was gone & so was my makeup bag, brushes, etc. We already had one experience w/ leaving 2 facecloths in a drawer so we would have extras and later finding them gone, obviously someone had gone through our things. We did file a report, but could not see it through, we had to get to the front of the resort to be picked up for the airport. The bus was 45 mins late & no one kept us informed as to the delay. We got to the airport & wanted to purchase the photo they took of us when we entered the airport upon our arrival & they could not find it nor did they go out of their way to locate it.

The chairs were set up for our 70 guests; however, the yellow caution tape surrounding the wedding ceremony is quite visible in all pictures, ruining the ambience. The couple arranged for a Dominican Justice of thePeace to marry them. (We have many e-mails confirming this) As I stood beside my husband, I kept asking, \"Where is the justice of the peace?\" :Who is going to marry them?\" Much to our surprise, the wedding planner dressed in her Iberostar uniform stepped up to perform the ceremony. After the ceremony, the confusion began. We had arranged for the guests to have champagne timmediately following the ceremony but no one communicated this to our guests .They eventually figured out that the champagne was for them and started to drift toward the table. The wedding party was taking pictures with the photographer as our wedding guests tried to \"guess\" where to go next. We had arranged for cocktails and hors'dourves outside the reception at the Steakhouse; however, nothing was set up when our guests arrived. The guests started to arrange the tables with votive candles, light the candles and then tried to track down the bartender. We paid extra for all of this to be prepared when our guests arrived. The bride and groom were left alone on the beach after the photographer finished. They walked by themselves back to the \"cocktail hour.\" The tables were not ready at the Steak House and we waited for over an hour before entering the steakhouse. Finally, the guests just stormed in. The bride and groom were once again left on their own to figure out what to do. With everyone seated, the bride and groom waited to be announced; however, there was no one to announce them as husband and wife. With the bride in tears, I stepped onto the dance floor, grabbed the michrophone and announced the newly married couple. Where was the wedding planner?? She was at another wedding taking place at the same time!! We had 75 people attending our wedding. She was at the wedding with 20 people. The salad bar was set up but there was no one there to direct our guests as to when to start getting their salad. Once again...I grabbed the microphone and told our guests to start making their way to the salad bar. Finally things settled down and the waiters started to take drink and dinner orders. Things were starting to run smoothly but not for long. Just as the cake was served, I noticed one of the waiters dressed in his Iberostar uniform guzzling a beer. I went to him and asked him to please return to serving our guests. He danced provocatively toward me and began to \"grind\" me. I ordered him to stop and he quickly apologized. I walked to my seat with him following me and apologizing profusely. He put his tray down on the floor beside me and spilled a full glass of beer all over my shoes, feet and the floor under my table. A wedding guest sitting beside me mopped the mess off the floor under me. Once again, I asked the waiter to \"Please, wait on our guests and get me a glass of wine.\" A few minutes later, I saw the same waiter at a guests' table with a bottle of wine and some glasses. I walked toward him and asked him to please pour me a glass of wine. What happened next is so humiliating. He drank from the bottle of wine and then poured some into a glass and handed it to me. He walked behind me, grabbed me in the groin and started to \"grind\" me from behind. My brother saw what was happening and raced over to get the waiter away from me. I quickly spoke to one of the managers. He was dressed in a plaid shirt with a western style tie. The manager laughed at me but shortly after, I noticed that the waiter had been sent out of the wedding. Immediately after this episode, the disc jockey shut down all his equipment and the wedding abruptly ended. What a nightmare for the newly married couple.
