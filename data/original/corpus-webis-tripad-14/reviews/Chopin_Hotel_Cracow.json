If you use the underpass out the front of the Hotel you can take the number 4 or number 10 tram into the centrum in minutes.

We only used the restaurant once, but each of us had a beautifully presented and delicious meal. The Hotel also has a great bar facility, which at the end of a day packed with sightseeing was very much appreciated. The bar also does bar snacks/ meals. Instead of booking our trips with coach companies, we chose instead to use the private driver service that is available from the Hotel. The driver is a very lovely Polish gentleman called Tony (Antoni). The cost of the private hire was minimally higher than a coach trip and instead of being told when to get off and on and when to be back, Tony waited at our daily destination , and we left when we were ready. Tony was ver helpful on arrival to attractions by taking you directly to the ticket counter and entrances and on occasions performed a couple of cheeky queue jumps, and on one visit managed to get us onto a ready to leave smaller guided tour. Tony was lovely, friendly, good fun and definitely enhanced our experience. If you get the chance, I highly recommend a day trip to Zakopane, which is the winter capital, and breathtaking in summer. And of course Auschwitz and the Sat Mines are an absolute must. We personally would also recommend the Schindler factory / Museum. It is more about the Jewish Quarter and the Jewish people during the time of the holocaust, and visually brilliant and informative. We thoroughly enjoyed every bit of our trip o Krakow and the Chopin was a perfect and welcoming base.
