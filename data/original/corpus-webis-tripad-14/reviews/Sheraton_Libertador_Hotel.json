We just left the Barra Sheraton in Rio and there couldn't be a more stark contrast. In Rio the facility was beautiful and the service excellent with people bending over backward to help and even giving us gifts for being SPG members. At the Liberador I just witnessed the only two font desk clerks literally yelling at a customer about the fact that the elevator wouldn't work and that he could not have a morning swim, this is in front of an entire lobby of people. The older gentleman was definitely complaining but not unruly or disrespectful in any way and asked to see the manager. The front desk clerks again yelled at him saying \"that's not the way it works here\" and \"the manager isn't here yet\" (9am).

This boutique Sheraton is one I keep recommending to friends and work collegues. It is a 2 minute walk from Florida Mall. Restaurants, Laundry, money change are all on your doorstep. It is very reasonably priced. Ask for a renovated room and you cannot go wrong! Being part of the worldwide Sheraton group of properties means that minimum standards are applied here and wifi in the reception area is ok.

The front desk staff were so personable and helpful - they really went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. They printed stuff out for us and even offered to phone the hotel we were staying at next in Uruguay to confirm our reservation (a big help because of the language barrier). The room we had (standard king) was modern and spacious, had a large TV with lots of channels and a nice, large washroom with a full tub and rainfall shower head. In-room internet is not free, but they have 5 computers in their business lounge area, all with really fast internet and free, unlimited usage. The location is very central and everything is either a short walk or cab ride away (we had wanted to stay in the Palermo area but couldn't find any rooms available for the time we were there at a reasonable price. However, a cab ride to Palermo was about 30 pesos so we still got to spend lots of time in that area, and had such a good experience at the Libertador that we didn't feel like we missed out on anything in the end.) We returned for a final night before our flight home out of BA and were upgraded to a Club Floor room which also included a complimentary full breakfast which was great. Lastly, the pool area in this hotel was a bonus too - it's on the top floor and was a great place to relax in the sun and lounge by the pool.
