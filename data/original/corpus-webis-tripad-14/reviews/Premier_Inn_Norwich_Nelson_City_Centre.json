We asked for a room overlooking the river and got it. It might have been noisy being over the Table Table and near to the bridge, but the double glazing solved that problem.

We had been given a 'good night sleep' guarantee, and it was no fault of the fluffy pillows and bed that I didn't achieve that. The bed was comfy, but I suffer from labrynthitis and the water-bed effect caused me some dizziness - and no, it wasn't the bargain wine on offer in Table Table!! We ate in there the two nights.
