The bedroom and the living room have wall-mounted flat screen TVs. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Only one of the two lifts was working and it took a while and a bit of squeezing to get to your level. There are a few things which we found not so exciting: The rooms are dark as they face the other tower. The bathroom is very small and there is little space to put things around the vanity. There is a shower over bath, and bathtub and toilet are separate from the vanity area. The closet space is right next to the vanity, very small as well and a bit annoying to access. I think a 5* hotel should supply quilt covers and not just sheets draped over a quilt and tucked under the mattress. Unless you feel comfortable sleeping like in a straight jacket you will find yourself in a bit of a mess of sheets and blanket in the morning, something I find not very hygienic. The kitchen is very practical with a nice big fridge, however, glasses and dishes for 2 people only, no cutting board or knife, etc. Although there is a dual cook top, there is no cookware at all. I doubt people will travel with their own frypan, so I guess the kitchen is not meant to do some cooking. However, all this put aside, it is a comfortable hotel and the location is fantastic!", "title": "Comfortable suite hotel in perfect location", "user": "goodfoodfanOZ", "date": "May 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 108254962}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I wouldn't classify this hotel as 5 stars...
