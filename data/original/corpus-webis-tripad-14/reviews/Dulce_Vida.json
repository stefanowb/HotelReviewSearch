Wow! Incredibly spacious, beautiful furnishings throughout (two bedrooms, and an extra small sleeping area; large living room, dining room, and kitchen; two well-functioning bathrooms), windows and doors aplenty opening out onto gorgeous gardens, and an enormous terrace area overlooking the pool with views down to the ocean. I think two other apartments were occupied while we were there, but it seems you always feel you have the place to yourself. And it's perfect walking distance from everything in town -- a few blocks from the Malecon (be warned, though -- they're steep uphill on the way home...), from Barcelona Tapas and Cafe des Artistes, River Cafe, Vitea, Trio, and a lovely walk to the Zona Romantica. John Huston's former house is right next door -- and the gardener started out working for Richard Burton! My only caveats are that it's incredibly hot in summer, despite an excellent fan system, and the geckos which keep you insect-free are very noisy at night, so bring ear-plugs.

Only 1 other couple was there during our stay. We stayed in Casa 5. Our Casa was sooo big! We loved having breakfast in the morning on our private patio area with a gorgeous view of the ocean. Fireworks at 9pm every night. Easy walk to the Malecon. Yes, the walk is a bit harder going back to the Casa but still a nice walk (10 min max). We explored the neighborhood and took photos with the local ladies/children. We took advantage of restaurant week (from mid May to end of May every year) and had delicious prix-fixe dinners for $25.00 pp. We had dinner the first night at LA PALAPA. Romantic restaurant on the beach. 30 minutes walk along the beach from Dulce. Dinner the next night at Cafe Des Artistes. Very artsy. Great food and atmosphere. It's only a 5 minute walk from Dulce. We walked around the downtown area during the day and relaxed by the pool (very pretty red tiles in person) It is a bit hot a night. Just leave the fan on and open the windows and doors. Very safe. There are also a lot of clubs and bars near by for those of you who want to party. Very convenient! We will be back again in a few weeks with friends.

Casa Dulce Vida has a good location in the center of Puerto Vallarta, close to many restaurants and the ocean. Nice pool area, friendly owners.
