The one off exit 38 proves to be the best. The young staff uplifts spirits and makes you feel young again. The place is beautifully furnished. I really enjoyed the pool. It was crystal clear and my room was spotless. After all the renovating, this place went from a 4 to a 10!!!! The mini breakfast was small but had a lot of choices. I would like to thank the staff for all their help in making my stay comfy.

We found the Microtel Inn to stay at for the night and found out that we had actually made reservations at the other Microtel in Brunswick (south) BUT beings that we had a broke down car, the Microltel Inn North switched our reservations without charging us. The guy Greg at the counter even though we were a little panicked was VERY calm and reassuring and gave us a lower rate than the other Microtel considering our predicament. He also was very kind and empathetic. The room was VERY clean, comfortable and the pool was nice. The next day a black lady at the counter ( I can remember her name she had a funny name) said that she would give us until 12 to check out without an extra late charge because of our situation even though we were supposed to check out at 11am. The continental breakfast also was good with a nice variety. Well, we checked out a little after 12 but never got our car back until about 12:45. She stood there with us and talked to us and tried to make sure we were ok and comfortable. We couldn't have asked for better hospitality!
