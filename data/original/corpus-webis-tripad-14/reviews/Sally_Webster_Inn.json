After some serious disappointments with other B&Bs based on their embellished websites, the Sally Webster Inn is a treasure. We were given 'Sally's Room'. A lovely, spacious room - the size of a larger bedroom, as this B&B is the former home of Ms. Webster. A magnificent mantle over the large decorative fireplace and period furnishings creates a charming room to come back to after a day at the beach or strolling the lovely town of Rockport. The king size bed was quite comfortable, a bonus for someone who suffers from chronic lower back pain. The immaculate room (clean is big with me) has a private bath but please note that the stall shower is on the smaller size. We are taller than some and average in size, and found it to be more than adequate. The window airconditioner worked well and provided the extra bonus of drowning out the traffic noise. Sally's Room is located on the street in the front of the house - right off the front door. And yet it felt very private. The owners are gracious and friendly yet leave you to enjoy the homemade breakfast each morning. We have stayed in many Inns and hotels over the years, and the Sally Webster Inn is a lovely little B&B. It's within walking distance to town and Front Beach - but plan to take your time on the return trip as it is all uphill. Good exercise!

I was afraid that staying at a B&B would feel like I was imposing on a stranger's home, but it didn't feel like that at all. My room, William's Room, was located on the top floor (attic) and, while more rustic in feeling than the other rooms, it was perfect for me. Basic amenities included a shower with great pressure, a very comfortable bed, TV, and a nice supply of Hershey's miniatures. John and Kathy also provided a binder full of information on the area, including several great walks. One morning, I woke up and took one of the walks they suggested, and it was fabulous. . . And when I came back, my pot of tea was waiting for me, along with a fresh fruit cup and, a few minutes later, a made-to-order Belgian waffle. Leisurely enjoying my breakfast while reading the Boston Globe provided for me, I felt that I could definitely get used to this kind of service :) (I also enjoyed my breakfast the day before--stuffed French toast.
