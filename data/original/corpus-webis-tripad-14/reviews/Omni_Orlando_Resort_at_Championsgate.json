We live in tampa and were just looking for a weekend getaway. I attempted to book the reservation online for a two room package, but I kept getting charged a separate price for each room so I called the resort directly. Front desk staff, BJ, booked the reservation for me. it took one hour total to book the reservation. I should have taken this as a foreboding of what was to come. Upon email confirmation from the resort of our upcoming stay 4 weeks after placing the reservation, i noted a mistake in the total number of guests in our party. I immediately called the resort and made them aware that we were a party of 4, not 2. I was told my rate would jump another $96/night. I protested, explaining that it was not my fault that BJ did not accurately place the reservation. 35 minutes later and after much protest, I was told they would honor the rate that I was quoted when the reservation was made. I guess they were doing me a favor for their mistake?! I checked in at 2, was charged the total for my 3 night stay PLUS Incidentals, as they call it, another $300. Seven hours later I was charged another 3 night stay charge on my card. I immediately went to the front desk and spoke with jasmine, who had nothing intelligable to say about this extraneous charge. She disappeared for 15 minutes and came back to say that Carlos, the manager on duty, had stepped out with another guest. One hour and 45 minutes and one more phone call to front desk, we have heard nothing. Our bank account has been charged more than double for our 3 night stay. Would I stay again? Absolutely not. Would I recommend this resort to a friend? Absolutely not. I cannot express my extreme disappointment in such a big name chain resort. Additionally, I am not even going to go into the lack of professional service that we encountered all day long...from lack of bellman at check in, one hour wait for luggage to be brought to room, no server for drinks at the \"formal pool\", etc, etc, etc. What should have been a relaxing weekend for my wife has started off as an exasperating, frustrating, miserable experience.", "title": "One of the worst experiences in a major hotel chain", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Scott P", "date": "August 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 170513087}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "A lovely hotel although travel agents will not advise you of the additional US $20 a night resort fee just that a resort fee is payable.

Nice room, beautiful property! Loved the lazy river and the pools! If you have kids go to the main pool (it can get noisy), if you are a couple or just want some relaxation time, head to the formal pool. The formal pool is not for you if you want to make a lot of noise, as when I was there, there were other people, but you could hear no noise! A bit of advice on the pool--make sure you can reserve a chair if the hotel is crowded--otherwise you may be out of luck! I had the breakfast buffet--was good, but seemed a little expensive which was expected. Didn't run into any issues with the staff, and coupled with such a beautiful property, my stay was wonderful!

No soap, dingy linen and many areas in need of repair. Service was great at the steak house. Food met expectations and more. Prices since our last stay seemed to have multiplied. How about the nerve to charge a guest $6.00 for a bottle of water because it was placed in the room. It seems to me that most high end properties at least comp. the water.

The room I received had the all the ac equipment outside...\u00fcber noisy. I called the front desk 7 times ( no kidding) before an operator picked up. I then had to wait close to 30 mins for the bell man to meet me at the other room with the keys. Finally dropped my bags off, then walked the long haul back to the parking lot to get my car so I could back offsite, only to find that my keys did not work at the gate. Honest mistake. Switched rooms, switched keys...gate pass didn't get put back on the new key. However, I proceeded to call the front desk to get someone to let me thru the gate...they transferred me to valet...who kept telling me they were opening the gate...not sure what gate...all this time no gate attendant. After about five minutes, I had to have the line of vehicles behind me back up so I could get back out of the line. I called them back they kept apologizing, yet they did nothing, since I was still driving round and round the parking lot. Finally, after five minutes a gate attendant made it to the booth, clueless as to what I had experienced. The funny thing is, I stayed based on a referral, and spent way more than I would have spent elsewhere. Very disappointing.
