My room was great, spacious and renovated--there were a few details that could be fixed (i.e. cracks in the bathroom walls, too much furniture in the bedroom and uncovered outlets), but I was only there for 2 days so it didn't bother me very much--I was out working most of my time in St. Louis. I will say that the elevators (I think there were 3) were almost never working at the same time.

Upon checking in, or trying to check in, they had no record of our reservation. The desk clerk was fantastic and got our problem straightened out. It did take him a while, he was the only one working. He handled the phones, people checking in and out and guest requests. If he had to run up to a guests room, the front dest was left un-manned. If I was rating this one employee, Steve, he would receive 5 stars. We visited with him several times during the first part of our stay. He was extremely pleasant and friendly to talk to and helped us out. He let us use the service elevator as there was no way we were fitting into the guest elevators with our luggage. Steve was top notch. Unfortunately, he was the highlight of our stay. We got to our room and the door was literally falling off the hinge, we had to lift it up to get it to close. No biggie, we can handle that. We got into the room and it was pretty hot. This was mid-March. It took me a while to find the temp controls, but I eventually did and set it to as cold as I could. We headed out for the evening for dinner. Upon returning several hours later, the room was just as hot and stuffy as when we left. We didn't actually complain, just went to bed. Hard to sleep in the heat, it was cooler in the hallways and outside than in the room. We had already unpacked and didn't want to change rooms, so we went on with our week, eventually opening the windows for most of our stay to cool the room. They didn't bother to clean our room the last two days of our stay. No fresh towels, no trash emptied and not beds made. Again, we didn't complain as we always arrived back to our rooms pretty late and didn't want to hassle with calling the front desk and complaining. We came back our last night and found all of our keys deactivated. Had to go back down to get them fixed. They told us not to store them with our cell phones. We hadn't, and two different people were carrying them (nowhere near their cell phones). Really wish I would have read these reviews before booking my hotel.
