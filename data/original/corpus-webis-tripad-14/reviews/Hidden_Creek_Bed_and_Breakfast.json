Hidden Creek is a gem\u2014the Ritz Carlton of B&B's. The rooms are beautiful and thoughtfully decorated; so comfortable and luxurious. Every amenity is available: laundry, dvds, jacuzzi, books, tv, cable, wi-fi, et al. One recommendation: if you're allergic to dogs, take your allergy medicine (it's worth it to stay here). Even though the cute, sweet family dog stays off the B&B floor, I still had a little sniffle. I want to live at Hidden Creek forever. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the to-die-for breakfast. I think that it was the best breakfast I've ever had.", "user": "TwoFourTheRoad", "date": "June 2, 2010", "id": 66117027}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We'll be back - every time we stay at Alyeska!", "text": "They think of everything, including things we didn't even realize we'd like!

My husband and I stayed here for only one night but could have easily made this our home! They have left no stone unturned in providing the most comfortable, anything you might need, accommodation for their guest. And then there is the breakfast, a menu mind you, that was fabulous. We always stay in Bed and Breakfast, but they may have ruined us from staying at all others!

We usually settled with Alyeska Resort Hotel not because we liked there so much, but just because we know the hotel so well , having been there many times. I chose the Bed and Breakfast this time after reading all the positive comments/reviews in Trip Advisor.com. It took me a little courage to break the old habit, but I\u2019m so glad that I did it. In Trip Advisor, some people described this B&B as \u201cthe best place I\u2019ve ever stayed,\u201d and I totally agree them! I\u2019ve stayed a B&B in Japan, Canada, Portland, OR, Florence, OR, Soldotna, AK, Fairbanks, AK, but Hidden Creek ranks the best one in our list so far. Michelle and Ron\u2019s excellent hospitality, resourceful information about local areas were just amazing. We enjoyed Michelle\u2019s excellent culinary skills and services at the breakfast as if we were at a restaurant. We also enjoyed delightful conversations with Ron, which made my husband feel like he didn\u2019t want to leave so soon :-) Our favorite was the hot tub, just outside by the common area down stairs. The room we stayed was clean and specious. My daughter and I were excited about the king size murphy bed since we'd never seen before. We were also surprised by the many books, photographs, maps, games, and DVDs in the common area. The entire area that we had access to is impeccably decorated with very nice art, pottery, and craft. It was an art gallery in the Bed and Breakfast. The magnificent stained glass window in the breakfast area is a master piece. Although we couldn\u2019t ski as much as we wanted to because of the warm, rainy weather on that day, we were able to relax and enjoy our trip to Girdwood. Thank you, Michelle and Ron. A great new year to you!", "user": "MBELee", "date": "December 28, 2009", "id": 51979964}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "By far the best lodging in Girdwood", "text": "Masako, Bob and Eleanor Lee", "user": "alaskapaddleinn", "date": "December 13, 2009", "id": 51170968}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best B & B in Alaska", "text": "Quite possibly the best bed & breakfast in Alaska, and more comfortable and friendlier than most fancy resorts.
