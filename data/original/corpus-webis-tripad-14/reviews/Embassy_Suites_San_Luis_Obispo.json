The staff was wonderful--you could tell they really enjoyed working at the Embassy. The bartender at the happy hour gave us wonderful informaton about having dinner at the restaurant. It is located in a shopping area with several shops nearby, a grocery store, and a Star Bucks! It is just a short drive to the downtown area. We always walk along the creek and really suggest lunch or dinner on the patios overlooking it. Thursday nights there is a great Farmer's Market with food and music.

The hotel was packed due to some high school sports tournament were requested and got a room with two queen beds. The room seemed days away from the elevator but that proved to be a blessing when we saw what the kids were up to in the front of the hotel. Check I was quick and we got to our room. As this was half way through the trip we needed to do some laundry. The laundry facilities worked fine. The rooms were comfortable and the queen beds were larger than the double beds we have had in other hotels so that was nice. The rooms could use a facelift, especially the bathrooms. The fridge was also so loud we had to shut it off. The next morning we had the complimentary breakfast which was the best we have had in the last 7 days is staying at Embassy Suites.

The carpeting is worn out, the room case goods are worn and the common areas smelled like smoke, all a bit disappointing.

Pass McDonalds & Starbucks & (if in standard vehicle) turn LEFT AT APPLEBEE's Restaurant (this access road will dead end you into SEARs on your left & back side of EMBASSY Suites on your right). If you are in Motorhome or other oversized vehicle, I'd suggest you pass Applebee's & take the next LEFT turn at the US Post Office (it's another access road, a little bumpy, but is less traveled and takes you directly to front entance of Hotel & shopping center's far end parking lot). Once you get settled, then try other options. There are shopping options galore within a mile of Hotel (at least 5 different shopping centers), including ones with Costco & Trader Joes, & numerous eating options for various budgets, also next door to Market, that also carries speciality foods.

Friday morning, one of the gentleman that works there made sure no one brought their dogs into the dining area. I'm not an animal hater, but to have allowed dogs into the eating area really upset me.
