The bus ride to major attractions using an Oyster card never took more than 15-20 minutes. Took the Tube to Heathrow for a whopping sume of 5 pounds. The room we stayed in had been recently added for the Olympics. It was larger than many European hotel rooms with all amenities working well. But, the best part was the conceriege service, especially a gentleman named Paul. He was extremely helpful in teaching us the navigational ropes of the buses and pointing us to good pubs and interesting sites. Thanks Paul. We are planning on going back to London next year and will very likely stay at the Grosvensor again. The only negative is a 1 computer \"business center\" which is not only difficult to find in the hotel but only accomodates 1 guest at a time.

The room itself was beautiful, enormous high windows, wonderful bathroom ( wich was very clean ), couch, desk and a closet with as a detail, lighting when opening the door, wich is very convenient. As a tip from the management and the other staff, we went ( equipped with umbrella, received from the concierge ) to covent garden the same evening, and although it was raining, we had a perfect evening and returned to the hotel tired but in a very good mood. We are both very picky when it comes to beds and not many hotels get away with a good score, but this one sure did, we slept like a baby and woke up much later then usual. After a quick shower, we went down for breakfast in the brasserie. The breakfast was good, not exeptional ( great coffee though ), but it almost never is when it comes to continental breakfast in an english hotel and that's the only remark I can make as where the hotel can improve, if they've had more choice, it would have been a perfect 10 hotel. I won't bore you with the rest of our personal stories in London, but I will stick to everything important : Hotel location : is perfect, almost in Victoria station, we found it easy to walk to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, St.Pauls etc. but I can imagine if you rather take the tube. The hotel itself : is just the way we like it, an old historic building wonderfully restored, nice features, well, go and see for yourself.

We paid a visit to the Champagne Bar before leaving for dinner - very pleasant. Breakfast was generally of good quality although the service was a little chaotic. We were shown to a table that somebody else was already using. We had to ask twice for coffee and twice for toast before getting any. The hot food was in short supply with a queue of people waiting for the trays to be refilled. Hot food was tasty though. Pastries were somewhat dry and there was a surprising dose of chilli in the nuts that were next to the cereals and fruit. In summary - a beautiful building in a lovely location.

When we visited the hotel was getting a revamp and the outside was covered in scaffolding. The lobby is wonderful - very impressive old victorian with a massive staircase made of marble. The check in staff were incredible and offered us an upgrade to a suite for a small charge which also included the breakfast. Of course we agreed! There are 2 suites on the 7th floor and you get the normal lift that goes up to the 6th floor and then take your private lift to your suite! The decor was brilliant, black, gray and red. A very large living area with flat screen telly, sofa bar etc. The bathroom was one of the best I have ever been in. Very large with 2 sinks, a claw footed bath in the middle of the room, a separate toilet and a walk in shower.The bedroom, although not large, had ipod docking stations etc and was again very well decorated. We had 2 doors into the suite and on our second night we found vouchers for 2 free drinks in the cocktail bar of the hotel pushed under one of the doors. We used them the following everning and were very impressed with the decor of the new cocktail lounge. The breakfast room was lovely but we were slightly disappointed with the lay out of the breakfast items. Everything is laid out around the outside of a small room and, although the flood was good, it took ages to get what you wanted because there was just not enough space for the amount of people getting breakfast.
