One of the elevators was out of order all of that time... is it fixed yet? The Front Desk staff are friendly. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and had good variety. The hotel has a large, comfortable breakfast room. For a suite hotel, we wished we could close a door between the sleeping room and the living room, since we have an infant who was sleeping in a crib in the living room, and who we had hoped would go to sleep earlier than us. We draped a blanket on the side of his crib to make it darker. I believe it was difficult to adjust the room's thermostat to a comfortable temperature - I kept tinkering with it. The \"room service\" dinners available from a nearby pub are very tasty and reasonably priced. We didn't think there was intrusive airport noise. The hotel is isolated from other businesses. We think we lost our baby's noise-reducing headphones in our first hotel room here, but the hotel claimed they didn't find them.", "title": "Pretty good stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TEW49ers", "date": "November 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121069157}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I have stayed at this hotel several times and I really do like it.
