The location of the Petite Auberge was much better than I had expected. Two blocks from the Powell Street Cable Cars, and two blocks over and three blocks down from Union Square (my only suggestion is that the Petite Auberge advertise this great location better on its website since I think it would be a plus).

The best thing about our stay was feeling like we were the only ones at the beautifully decorated and outfitted French boutique hotel in the heart of Nob Hill in San Francisco. They knew our names when we came in the door to check in! How does that happen? Within 24 hours all of the staff knew who we were and they were very helpful in discovering what we would likely want to explore while we were in the Bay Area for a week. I had sent a few packages ahead along with some flowers (a local florist recommended by their staff) to be placed in our room on the day of our arrival. The room looked like I had been there before and arranged everything for my wife. The staff was just so attentive to \"who we are\" that it was like family helping us out. I should mention that our room was in perfect order and clean as soon as we left each day. We even left one morning for a quick snack and returned to a completely cleaned room - it was almost as if they were hiding in the halls waiting for us to leave so they could start cleaning. Many other things about our stay were wonderful as well. The fireplace in our wonderfully decorated room was a real treat. The bathrobes were one of my wife's favorites (so much so that we have two of them hanging in our closet right now!). The full breakfast each morning (comes with the room), was not only delicious but also served in a great little french cafe atmosphere where you could check with other guests to see what they were going to do that day or had done the day before. This was also the primary conversation at the wine tasting (free with the room as well) each evening around a fire in the lounge. Just a few guests would gather at the end of the afternoon and exchange sightseeing and exploring stories over wine (many choices) and snacks. All of this was informal so you wouldn't have to include yourself in the conversation if you chose not to. Sometimes just a good breakfast or glass of wine was all we wanted - and that was all we got. All in all, the value of our room was outstanding. We got so much more than we paid for.
