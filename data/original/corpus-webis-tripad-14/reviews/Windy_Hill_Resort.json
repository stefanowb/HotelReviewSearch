After looking at the room and property for Cahal Pech Resort we wanted to swich properties,but it was too late for us to change. The amenties and pool at Cahal Pech was inviting and up to standard.

They didn't have heineken which is a pretty standard beer throughout the world. We ask for top shelf liquor and they didnt' have any top shelf tequila either. We then settled for a lime margarita and ordered some food and request they take to pool-side while we swam. Long story short it took them over 1 hour to bring our drinks and food. We met other vacationers that wanted to order food as well poolside and the bartender staff never came back to take their order the whole 2 plus hours we were in and near the pool. We asked about their onsite spa they advertised on the property and they actually don't have an onsite spa, they call someone off the property for double the price. You would be better off going in town and getting an massage directly with the third party for a reasonable price.

The staff always went above and beyond to meet our every need. We prebooked our excursions prior to leaving the US. Our one stipulation was to not do the Jaguar Cave Tubing on the same day as a cruise ship was in port. Windy Hill arranged all our excursions around this request. Don't miss the the ATM cave - truly amazing. Do miss the Mountain Pine Ridge Reserve unless you want to ride on a bumpy dusty road for more than an hour one way just to glimpse the 1000' waterfall from a great distance. The Rio Frio pools and Big Rock were a lot of fun. There aren't really any pines in the reserve of any size. Having visited many Mayan ruins previously we did not include them this trip but they are well worth seeing. The bag lunches leave a lot to be desired so pack some nabs or protein bars. The resort food was fantastic. You must try the chicken soup! The staff was happy to bring me anything off the menu at any time. My favorite was a plate of fruit - had one at every meal!
