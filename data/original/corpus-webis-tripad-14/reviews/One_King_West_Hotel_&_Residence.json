First, location. I took public transportation from the airport which if you have some time and want to save some money, this is the way to go. For $2.50 I took the Rocket bus (#192) to Kipling Station and then took the Subway to the King stop and walked upstairs to find the hotel. Overall the trip took about an hour. Upon arrival at the hotel at 12:40pm was told that my room was ready which was a pleasant surprise (I was prepared just to drop off my bags and head over to the Rogers Centre). The guy who checked me in suggested I take a cab if I wanted to make it to the game on time which I did. It's about a $6 cab ride otherwise it's about a 25 min walk (which I did on my way back from the game). Next, the room itself was wonderful which a nice kitchen and very comfy bed. I had an interior room so no view but that's fine since I wasn't planning on spending much time in the room. The floor I was on was very quiet so I was able to sleep like a baby. The decor was very nice and modern and the bathroom was a nice size. I would have liked to see a hook of sorts to hang your towel especially since they are into reusing to conserve energy.", "title": "Absolutely Loved this Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MJ24", "date": "July 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17875926}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was only there for one night so I can't comment on the maid service but all in all everything else was great.

You cannot beat the location of this hotel though, you are steps away from Eaton Center, a couple of blocks away from most theatres in the city and very close to a zillion great restaurants. One thing that did annoy me was I had asked for some chocolate covered strawberries to be in the room when we checked in and I told them exactly when we were checking in. They did not arrive, we were in the room for 2 hours before going out for dinner, upon our return from dinner and a movie at 11:30pm they were there and the chocolate was melted off them even though there was a fridge for them to put them in so I found this annoying.

They gave me a choice of a room on the 27th floor with a view and a stand up shower or a corner suite on the 8th floor with a full size tub/shower combination. I took the 8th floor room and had a nice view of King and Yonge Street. The room as very clean and had all the comforts of home and more. It had hardwood floor throughout, a king size bed which was very comfortable, very nice white bedding, a 27 inch TV with a DVD player, nice size bar fridge, micowave, small dishwasher, sink, dishes, etc. to go with it all, a small washer and dryer, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, good sized safe that held a laptop computer and much more, good size desk and two very comfortable chairs - one leather office chair and one easychair with ottoman. It was very quiet, no noise from next door, above or below what so ever. The temperature control seemed to work well. Calls to guest services were dealt with promptly and politely. The conciere desk staff were very helpful on giving directions, restuarant recommendations, etc. Checkout was smooth, bell services kept my luggage from 8 AM - 2:30 PM for no charge. The VERY BEST THING about this hotel is it's LOCATION. You can exit directly from the hotel into the underground PATH system. You can go out the door, into the PATH system, turn left, go down a short flight of stairs and get on the subway. I walked to and from my course (about two blocks away) without stepping outside, no jacket or umbrella's required. The entertainment district is within walking distance as is the Eaton Centre mall. And when you have a bunch of bags to carry back after shopping all evening at the mall, you can just hop on the subway for $2.75 and get a ride straight from the mall to the hotel in a matter of minutes - again all without stepping outside. The hotel lobby is grand and beautiful. Had room service once - it was a little pricey but the food and service were excellent. They offer a long distance/internet package for $4.99/night. Gives you high speed internet and unlimited long distance which I used extensively. Worth every penny. Had no problems connecting to the internet. High speed - although not wireless worked very well. Paid $209/night which is a steal for a hotel of this quality in this location.

The hotel was located on the main shopping street in downtown and not to far from the Eaton centre.... you may of guessed i did loads of shopping! From this hotel everything is in walking distance - habour/CN tower/nightlife etc. This is a great hotel for a tourist who can walk everywhere if the weather is good. The rooms were very big, with a washing and a dryer/cooking hob/ fridge/ mircrowave. as we were travelling alot we washed a few clothes very easy to use just need to buy some powder to put in tho. bathroom a good size... only annoying thing was that when other people closed there doors our door would shake as if someone was trying to enter into our room which woke me up a few times in the night as i thought someone was trying to get in!!! otherwise great hotel for tourists with a great locations to all the tourist attractions!!", "title": "Great Location Fab rooms", "user": "travel_the_world2008", "date": "June 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17020161, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location location!!", "disliked": "\u2014 shaking doors at night!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled on business", "text": "We had a very nice stay at 1King West during a recent business conference.

There is a subway stop at the hotel as well as an entrance to the PATH (underground shopping), but the best part is that antique cars are available to take you wherever you want for free (reserve in advance and tip the driver of course). The restaruant (Dominion Club) has an impressive atmoshpere and is very reasonably priced. However, while we found the breakfast to be good we were much less impressed with dinner there.
