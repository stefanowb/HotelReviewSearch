Upon arrival valet was quick and were equally as fast the three times we had to access our car. Check-In was easy and fast. The best part for us about this hotel is that you only have to walk a block to the riverwalk but do not have all of the noise that the riverwalk can sometimes bring. Additionally it is only about 4 doors away from the Childrens Museum which is one of the main reasons we go to the Riverwalk. It is also a very short walk to the Alamo. It seems that we can get to everything that the kids want to do and without having to load up the car or get exhausted walking in the heat. The staff is so nice and the breakfast at Barrons is wonderful. There are so many great things about this hotel. I will agree with other reviewers that the bathrooms are small but seriously who is spending their time in the hotel in the bathroom??
