Quiet (not sure it is always as quiet as the road on which the hotel stands was closed at one end due to building renovations on the street) and seemingly tucked away from the main hustle it was nevertheless in a really convenient location. Our room was spotless and had a very big bathroom. There were some really lovely touches like the turn service including bedside floor mats each evening. As well we discovered that we could order afternoon tea and have it delivered to our room (or the lovely first floor garden) beautifully presented in a teapot and with \"proper\" teacups plus biscuits. I chose this hotel on the basis of the garden and it did not disappoint - we spent each morning enjoying a leisurely breakfast and reading the papers downloaded to the ipad courtesy of free wi-fi. The breakfast food was pretty standard fair and the coffee was not great but the setting made up for it. All the staff we met were very helpful and we rarely saw any other guests so it felt like we had the place to ourselves most of the time.", "title": "Quite special", "user": "cammg", "date": "February 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125265258}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Residenza Del Moro is a charming boutique hotel in the heart of Florence.
