They say limited suites and I've stayed in regular rooms with more space and better amenities. You can get much better places to stay in nearby areas for the same price. Rooms are not clean, service is poor, staff is unfriendly and breakfast is below par. We booked a non-smoking room, but had to change to a smoking room due to the unbearable stench. The restroom was small and congested, and was not clean. Definitely not the place you'd want to stay on a vacation.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Traveler123435", "date": "July 5, 2007", "id": 8062598}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "We stayed here on our drive up to Tenessee with our children.

The management was horrible--not at all friendly, helpful, or understanding. When we were there, there was a 10 minute policy about accepting the room. Maybe I am just not an experienced traveller, but I have never heard of a place where you have 10 minutes from check-in to say whether you want to keep the room. We barely got into the room before the front desk called to see if we wanted to stay. Stupid us said yes, before actually looking at the room. It ended up being horrible, and we decided to leave, but they said our 10 minutes were up. We ended up leaving without our money, but after about 30 minutes of arguing, they ended up giving us a voucher for the next time. Why would I want a voucher for a terrible hotel?
