{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 115, "name": "Quest on William", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect for families...", "text": "We (family of 4) stayed at Quest on William in late June 2005 in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite for 3 nights. The suite was extremely spacious with 2 separate bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms. We were located on the second floor and did not experience any noise issues noted in some earlier reviews. A dining area with table and seating for 4 adjoins a sitting area with 2 sofas (one sofa bed) and opens on to a balcony. DVD player provided in room with a small dvd library at reception. A fully apppointed kitchen with microwave and dishwasher makes for a very comfortable stay if you feel like eating in. Suite also had its own laundry with washine machine and dryer for grubby kids (and big kids) on holidays. Quest is located near the coner of William and Bourke Sts, which are both serviced by trams and tram stops are located almost at the entrance to the apartment building. Reception staff were excellent and obliging with directions and maps. Check-in and check-out were completed efficiently. Overall, an extremely comfortable stay in a very well appointed and modern suite in a very convenient location. Why all squeeze into a hotel room (or 2) when you can stay at serviced apartments like this for the same cost? Highly recommended for family stays.", "user": "NoPlaceLikeHome889", "date": "July 4, 2005", "id": 3633595}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Shame about the kitchen.", "text": "Excellent service by staff. Apartment kept spotlessly clean. Decoration immaculate, well furnished and very comfortable. Kitchen had ceramic hob. electric oven, freezer/refrigerator etc. but was lacking in small equipment. No teatowels, no plug for sink, not adequately equipped to cook a full meal. We actually wanted to do that as we were on a month's holiday and restaurant eating can get tiresome.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 8, 2004", "id": 2646881}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Staff fantastic", "text": "Excellent value for money otherwise and very conveniently situated.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 14, 2004", "id": 1784401}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location but a bit noisy", "text": "2nd time I've stayed and Congratulations to the staff at Quest on William, they were fantastic and always a help. The apartments were out of this world. Fully self contained with everything. Housekeeping was excellent and after 8 nights in Melbourne it was hard to leave and have to go home and do all my own cleaning. I work for a very large Australian company in IT and have organised all staff to start using Quest on William. Average room nights into Melbourne 600 per year and I'm not going to look anywhere else. Well done to Noel - Manager and all his excellent staff - very impressed with the staff being able to speak basis Chinese and Bahasa Indonesian.(only confirms excellent customer service) - My advise book in advance, always hard to get a bed - not surprised", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 18, 2004", "id": 1729810}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent Location!!!!", "text": "Recently satyed at the Quest on William. We booked here as we were three friends on a girlie shopping getaway and found it very hard to find a motel offering 3 seperate beds, everything I looked at required a rollaway or sofa bed. This 2 bedroom apartment was perfect, comfortable and spacious. Beds were above average in comfort. Check in and out were efficient and courteous. The only request we had was calling up for a hair dryer as the one in our room was missing- the response was immediate.", "user": "kazkap", "date": "September 14, 2007", "id": 8711200}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great room, good location", "text": "Admitedly we didn't spend too much time in the apartment, too much to see and do in only two days, but it was a comfortable and quiet little retreat.
