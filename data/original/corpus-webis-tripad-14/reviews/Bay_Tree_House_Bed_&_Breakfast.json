My mum and neice and I stayed for 3 days at the Bay Tree annex across the road with Breda and PJ, Janice and Peter's close friends who have extended their home to staying guests also on the back of the success of the Bay Tree. You are living with Breda and PJ in their beautiful home and very pretty garden. It was like staying with friends! Tube passes were organised (and paid for in advance by Peter...thanks!), and we were set up for a fierce day of tourism each day on sublime breakfasts! Breda very sweetly asked for my opinion on some ways to improve what she did (I own a small place too ....that's why she asked).....Breda.....Change nothing; you are excellent.

There is a beutiful park practically right behing the house and the tube station Arnos Grove is a 5 minnute safe walk. I HIGHLY recomend staying here it was such a superb experience.

From the initial email contact to the final departure, James and Janice consistently offered sage advice and accommodating service that went well beyond that which is normally encountered even in the best of hostelries. From the moment of arrival, James and Janice made us feel like friends and family. My wife, adult daughter and I stayed in the triple ensuite on the second floor to the front. It was a spacious, well acquainted room, large enough to also include a comfortable sofa. The bathroom was very large, especially by European standards, immaculately clean, and well equipped. For relaxing, we had full use of the sun room overlooking the garden that was stocked with many books, especially travel books of London and Britain. Our hosts even extended to us the use of the laptop with wireless service and Skype telephone services. The breakfast was worthy of a Michelin rating. A choice of fruits, cereals, scones, muffins, bagels, yogurts and several juices awaited you at the table. Janice expertly cooked a full English breakfast to order (eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, mushrooms, and tomatoes) or French toast or oatmeal. All with a constant supply of tea or coffee. Before setting off for the day, they packed us up with water and snacks and ensured that we were all set on directions. Whether chatting with Janice in the kitchen in the morning or having a good English Ale with James in the evening, the conversation was always lively and informative. All of this at a very affordable price (a veritable bargain by London standards). In a number of trips to London, we had never lodged outside of Central London, but our experience with James and Janice made the 4-5 walk to the tube stop and 20-25 minute tube ride downtown a very small price to pay for such outstanding accommodations.", "title": "The ultimate in hospitality, generosity, and friendliness.", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "chas_di_hat", "date": "March 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 26865533}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I celebrated a milestone in our lives with a trip to London and Paris.

Bay Tree House is so clean - you know that saying that it's so clean you could eat off the floors - well, you could. It is also so charming and inviting. Janice and James made us feel at home immediately. They seemed to know how to respond to each guest in the way that was appropriate for that person. Doing this is an art. When we got home I thought of all of the effort that had gone into making our stay at Bay Tree House seem effortless. I know that Janice and James had to work very, very hard to make everyone's stay so perfect, but they never let on that they were working. They were cheerful and focused on service and on ensuring the best vacation possible for their guests.
