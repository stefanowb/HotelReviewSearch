I didnt pay that price to stay in a second rate hotel. Well I ended up taking $50 bucks in cash and moved on down to the other hotel.

It's only 15 minutes to downtown, the price was great, hotel is stunning on the inside, room was superb, beds very comfy, amazing soaps that were spa quality. The only negative thing I would say about this hotel is the drink prices at the hotel bar are so outrageous that the bartender actually told us to not drink there. 7 bucks for the cheapest beer and 11 for a basic wells drink. Would have been nice to have some drinks at the bar before we went out but it really wasn't a big deal.
