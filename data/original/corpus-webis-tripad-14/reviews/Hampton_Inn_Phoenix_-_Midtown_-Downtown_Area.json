After doing a little research this hotel seemed to fit the bill so we booked a two queen room. The rooms are plain with a large bathroom, both were very clean and everything worked. There were several places to eat within a few miles of the hotel and several museums. The pool area is small but perfect for a quick dip. The free morning breakfast was very, very good. It had everything from cereals to make your own waffles. This hotel was perfect for what we were looking for since we were just passing through. Another reviewer commented on the helicopters landing on the adjacent hospital and of the noise. Several helicopters did land while we were in the pool however that was the only time we actually noticed them. I did notice that we were the only family there with children at the time (5 yoa and a 10 yoa). During breakfast, I could see that this hotel's main clientele is business travelers and those which are visiting the hospital. If we were to be staying in Phoenix longer, then we probably would have gone with a different hotel since this one is a bit bland and almost feels like you need to be whispering so as not to disturb anyone.", "title": "Nice, Quiet Stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Distant Lights", "date": "June 14, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 67479716}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The staff was very personable and helpful.

We were a little unsure of staying at the Hampton, which is so close to St. Joe's, it's almost connected. It's actually on hospital grounds. The reviews in Trip Advisor were mixed. What we found was a very nice, clean, room with a decent-sized bath, desk and comfy chair, 27\" TV with a fairly good array of free channels. The beds are super comfy and the all-cotton puffy bedding is even better. Pillows are super soft. A full breakfast is available, free of charge, including fresh fruit salad, make-your-own waffles, egg omelets, meat which varies day by day, cereals, yogurt, various breads, bagels, etc., coffees, teas and juices. The staff is very courteous and the location is absolutely perfect if you have to go back and forth to the hospital. I'm a very light sleeper and had no trouble getting to sleep, because the room was quiet. There are enough restaurants within a short walk to survive -- Italian, Mexican, Thai and a Deli. There's also an egg place with breakfast, lunch and dinner plus a really nice smoothie place and a coffee shop.

I've never been to Phoenix before, but even thought the location is listed as downtown, I felt like we were no where near downtown. We were surrounded by the hospital. And driving around on a Saturday night, we didn't encounter much of anything that was open at 8:30pm. They had a decent breakfast in the morning and free coffee/tea in the lobby (a Hampton Inn standard). The staff was OK. Nothing really impressive across the board.
