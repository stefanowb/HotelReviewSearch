Lauren and Andrew's home is beautiful and in a great location. This home base was perfect for exploring other towns in the Cotswolds. From the home, a short 5-minute walk into the town provided access to pubs, restaurants, and shopping. The Jacobean suite was large, comfortable, and perfect for the two of us. Also, the water pressure was great in the shower! Breakfast was delicious and in a comfortable dining room. A nice perk is complimentary port, scotch, or sherry for the evening after exploring the Cotswolds! Lauren was wonderful: informative, pleasant, and fun! I would stay here again definitely!", "title": "Outstanding!", "user": "arizona0615", "date": "September 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141597357}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "A wonderful find in a perfect location 5*+++!! The best B&B we have stayed in, Lauren the host was so welcoming with a glass of champagne on arrival, she even booked tables for us and recommended restaurants for the evenings we were staying. The living rooms were luxurious, yet homely with complimentary port & whisky, the bedroom (Spencer Suite) at the top of the house was like a secret hideaway....stunning bathroom and the most comfortable bed made it difficult to leave!! The breakfast was wonderful, infact there was absolutely nothing negative to say atall!! A great base to explore the cotswolds and an even better retreat to return to after a day out sightseeing! I would recommend it time & time again!

The hosts (Lauren & Andrew) are very fun, warm and helpful. They gave us brilliant recommendations for everything from dinner to hairdressers. They also went above and beyond the call of duty - I left a jumper at a place in town - Lauren collected this and bought it down to London within the same week! So sweet. Also, Lauren made the most amazing breakfast which was the only think that would get me out of the hugely comfy bed. Lovely touches throughout the house and rooms - e.g., port and glasses in the room. Set in the most beautiful area. I will definitely be going back.

Cannot recommend East House enough. Lauren and Andrew are the perfect hosts from the minute you arrive until you leave. Such a warm welcome to their stunning home. Everything was there for your comfort. Cosy lounges with log fire and complimentary drinks. Luxurious bedrooms and bathrooms (the Edwardian Room we stayed in had a marble en-suite with underfloor heating and heated seating area in the shower!). Free toiletries, aperitifs and a glass of champagne on arrival were all little touches that makes your stay extra special. As for the breakfast, well it's just amazing, you won't need to eat again until tea-time!! East House is just a 5-10 minutes very pretty walk into the village centre where you are spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat. We ate the Broadway Hotel Brasserie and the Swan Hotel and had excellent food at reasonable prices at both. For a cup of tea and cake try Tisanes Tea Room where you will be spoilt for choice. We stayed at East House for 3 nights and can't wait to return.
