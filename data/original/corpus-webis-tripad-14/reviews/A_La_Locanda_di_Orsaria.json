We had an early train, and staff were not accomodating to even arrange a quick croissant for the road. Also, there is no lift and all rooms are accessed by narrow, steep stairs.

We were looking for a hotel close to the train station (literally a 2 minute walk without getting lost) that could accomodate 4 people in a room. Here's how our stay went: We turned left outside the station, continued on past the bridge and we turned down the second \"calle\" (alleyway). On the wall to the right was written a number of hotel names and when we saw \"Locanda\" we knew we were on the right street. We went down a bit and it's on the right hand side. Reception staff was really warm, all of them spoke English well. Our room was absolutely gorgeous, really large and exactly what was pictured on their website. Beautiful murano glass chandelier and sconces on the wall by the bedsides. The bathroom is beautiful and the water pressure is really good. This hotel has thought of everything to make your stay wonderful. The beds are really, really comfortable too. It was so tastefully decorated and the antique dresser/desk was such a nice addition to the room. When we opened our window in the morning it was music to our ears to hear the sound of footsteps echoing in the alleyway and to hear people talking...truly Italian. We even had a pigeon land on the windowsill and look in. We really hoped it wouldn't fly in though. The breakfast is to die for!!! The attention that is given to you at breakfast is absolutely wonderful. The food is terrific and you'll find terrific food all over Venice too. We were pretty sad to leave because we were only there for 2 nights but next time we come we'll stay longer, stay in the same room. We had to leave early in the morning and the front staff suggested that we pay our bill the previous night so as to save time in the morning and we did and it worked out great for us. We didn't have to take any waterbuses or taxis to get around and it was great not to have to lug our suitcases all through Venice looking for our hotel. Beware that when you take a vaporetto or taxi to your hotel that you are not only paying to get onto it but you also have to pay 6 euros for each piece of luggage that you have. One more reason for staying close to the station. This is a real gem in Venice and I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.
