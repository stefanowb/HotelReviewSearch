Upon entering the hotel, we were greeted by the front desk person and were in our rooms very quickly. This place is all newly renovated and everything is new and clean. The rooms had a unique design to them and the bed was very comfortable. Nice flat screen TVs and the shower had plenty of pressure. The restaurant lounge on site seemed adequate. In the morning, they have a cafe with Starbucks coffee available. Very convenient and right off the interstate.", "title": "Nice Newly Renovated Hotel", "user": "mainetoday", "date": "December 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 22457235, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 new clean rooms, comfortable bed", "disliked": "\u2014 wireless internet was down"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Great large rooms w/ hardwood floors large shower.
