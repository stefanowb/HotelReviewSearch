And since it was so late, there was no maintenance person available. There was only one other room available which was smaller than what our cruise stateroom was! So at 11pm, we had to move all of our stuff down the hall to another room, in which we and our luggage barely fit. We were offered a reduction in our room rate. The continental breakfast was average.
