With people using words such as \u201cbright\u201d, \u201cclean\u201d, \u201cnew\u201d, and \u201cservice\u201d, this hotel certainly lives up to the expectations. I have stayed at all but 3-4 hotels in Bangor/Brewer over the last few years, and this hotel is, without a doubt, on my top three list. The hotel is very clean and bright. The rooms are spacious and the beds offer a wonderful night\u2019s sleep. Very rarely do I have a night in a hotel without some anxiety\u2026 but not here. The sheets, pillows and cover were clean and new\u2026 even after careful inspection. The d\u00e9cor throughout the hotel is current and slightly above par for most new American hotel trends; trends which have still not found their way to most of the hotels down on Odlin Road. I really enjoyed the regional d\u00e9cor highlight the state of Maine, particularly with the room number plates (see photos). The morning breakfast is wonderful as well! There are plenty of selections that will provide an adequate start to any day (without having to find breakfast elsewhere!). Another plus is the staff at the hotel: All the staff greeted me with a smile and hello. It was apparent that the hotel was well staffed and even the breakfast team was efficient and friendly, even visiting each table to ask if everything was fine and giving guest a box of mints. The hotel's location is a short drive to shopping and likely most area hotels, is unable to offer much for interesting views. If I had one complaint, it was with the pool: the chlorine was a bit much and it wasn\u2019t long before most of the children were coughing in rhythm. But if this little issue was taken care of, the pool would certainly be one of the best hotel pools in Bangor. Perhaps the hotel might be a bit over budget for some vacationers. However when you factor in the gracious breakfast and the top-notch condition of the rooms and beds, you might come out on the losing end if you choose another hotel (what price do you put on cleanliness and a worry-free sleep?).
