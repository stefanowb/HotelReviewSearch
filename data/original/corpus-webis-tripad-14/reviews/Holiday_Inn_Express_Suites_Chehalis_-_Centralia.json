The staff were helpful and patient. There were cookies available when we arrived, plus everyone got a little treat upon check in (microwave popcorn + a few chocolates).

Lots of room to eat in the breakfast area. The pool area was warm and clean. The hot tub was lukewarm, which was the only downside. The pool itself was large enough for an adult to swim short laps if they wanted to, but also good for kids to play in.
