We had a suite with a king bed (in a separate room), pull out couch and kitchenette. It was quite nice. Our friends rented the same type of room and theirs also had a table, but not as good of a view. The building is starting to show its age in some areas but is kept very clean. It is a simple, but nice hotel. The staff were very friendly. The brunch at the resaurant was good and a reasonable price because kids under 6 ate free. The salt water pool is not as large as it seems in the pictures, but is sufficient and it is nice that it is salt water. It also has a hot tub. The waterslide was a hit with my 5 year old (there is a height restriction so smaller kids cannot go on it). Unfortunately it is in a separate room beside the pool, and so it was not as accessible as I would have liked, plus it was very cold where the slide was. The kids game and play room was a hit with my little ones. The hotel is centrally located for the downtown business core of Ottawa (it is about a 5 minute walk to Parliament Buildings and a 15 minute walk to the Byward market).
