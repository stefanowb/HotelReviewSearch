Although our reservation was only for the 8th, I had called the hotel to make sure there would be room for us a night early. We had 3 nights booked under a corporate rate (75$/night) and then ended up having to pay the full price for the early night ($150+tx) I didn't mind if it meant not having to drive during the snow storm. The hotel itself is clean and simple. There's a lobby bar/ restaurant that was very convenient, especially when it seemed the entire city shut down on the 8th because of the snow. We had the rejuvn8 burgers one night, very filling. Another night we shared the nacho plate, wasn't bad. We shared the bruschetta with a bottle of wine another time, also not bad at all.", "title": "Good business stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "514tattoos", "date": "March 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153631735}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The rejuvn8 restaurant became our home while the snow crippled the city.

Called the hotel and receptionist said he is leaving now and will be there in 15 minutes. Another 45 minutes later he arrived and said he had to wait for another customer whose flight was arriving in 5 minutes! We were frozen, upset at the continuing delay and the fact that whilst we had been made to wait 1 hour and 13 minutes, we should be asked to wait perhaps another 30 minutes for the customer whose plane had still to arrive - let alone wait for his luggage or go through customs/immigration! At this point I did lose my temper whereupon the shuttle driver gave me his phone to speak to the receptionist...I explained my dissatisfaction and requested we be transported immediately which they finally agreed to do. While waiting for this shuttle, all the other hotel shuttles had passed by at least twice..including the Days Inn bus - a hotel which is several layers below Sheraton yet seems to offer punctual shuttle service.

The room is in front of the elevator and ice machine. So, you don't get much quiet. The agent would not give me a new room! Luckily it wasn't extremely noisey. I was just disappointed the agent refused to give me a new room. Anyhow, I ordered wings from room service. It arrived in about 20 minutes.
