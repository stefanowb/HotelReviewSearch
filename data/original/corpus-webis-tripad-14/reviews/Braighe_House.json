John offered me a beer and my wife a glass of wine. Premises are unlicensed and this was offered a friendly gesture and not for any other reason. Rooms were of a very high quality (Choose the superior with its sea view its worth the extra) that extra touch and attention to detail, i.e. with bathrobes and luxurious toiletries making worthy of its 5 star rating. Breakfast was one of the best, great choice, home made muesli and yoghurts adding that personal touch and the quality and choice were second to none.

She was 3 at the time. And it was tottally incredible! I usually go three star but i chose this property as i thought it looked nice. We were welcomed in a very friendly way. The family are lovely! And its a short walk from the bnb to a beach which was great for my daughter! I dont drive so we used the island bus service which was regular and stopped right outside the bnb. It's a very reasonable service, and the drivers are more than ok about helping you on the bus with a buggy. One morning the family's daughter offered to give us a lift into the town centre before she went to school which was extremely hospitable. Really nice. On the morning we left it was blowing a gale outside, and in order to catch the ferry we left at about 6am, but the owner helped us get into the taxi and even made us a packed lunch for the journey home, which included jelly peices for the wee yin and crisps and juice etc. This amazed me! i have never had such an amazing service! And was an extra touch that really made the holiday memorable. I have been to Stornoway three times in total but my pictures and memories from the three days i spent in october 2006 are the best! My little girl loved it! And the quality of such an amazing bnb made it that way! Would definately recommend this accomodation to anyone!

Lovely sitting room, with complimentary drinks. When I mentioned a flower I had seen, the hostess researched it and left me a note on my bed with its name - fabulous service! My only criticism is the inflexibility of breakfast times. We, in common I suspect with many other guests given the location, needed to leave early for the ferry, but the breakfast on Sunday did not begin till nine. Instead we were given a sandwich, granola bar, apple and juice box.
