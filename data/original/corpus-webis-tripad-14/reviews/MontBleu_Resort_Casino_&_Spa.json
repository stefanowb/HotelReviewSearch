Apparently double beds only have a regular tub though. Luckily we were moved without any problems but ended up in a lower floor with no view. The king bedded room is pretty large compared to other hotels' standard rooms. It has a very nice and large round Roman tub for romantic getaways. The bathroom overall is also pretty big. Housekeeping seemed to do a good job, room was very clean. But overall, the rooms are worn and tired, some of the curtains are stained. They need to remodel. Room service seemed greatly overpriced. I ordered dinner the first night and it was as expensive as a classy restaurant, but the food was not worth the price. Their buffet closed an hour later than advertised and room service started serving their limited \"late night\" menu earlier than advertised. I did have breakfast every morning of our stay and it was good, though still a bit pricey. I was there to ski so did not gamble nor used the spa.
