More than adequate, though I would've loved warm scrambled eggs added to the offerings (good to have protein before a day on the slopes).

I agree with the other reviewers in terms of the comfort and size of the guest rooms and the great location of the property. Loved walking around Vail Village. However, their rooms are noisy if you face the front of the property as when the bars close down at night, you can hear all the revelers down on the street/sidewalk. As well, I did not feel their guest service was as great as some others have indicated. My husband and I booked a Columbine room (which had to be pre-paid due to peak season) a month before we arrived. However, when we checked into the property, the front desk clerk originally tried to check us into a Lupine room, which was much less expensive than the one we had pre-paid. Then, he asked if we would like an upgrade to a suite (as the hotel was very empty that week-end), but instead of offering it to us on a complimentary basis, he wanted us to pay even more for this \"privilege\". We travel a lot both for business and pleasure and frequently are upgraded to nicer rooms when we check into hotels, but never for an additional fee. Typically a high quality hotel will do that to engender greater guest loyalty and strong word-of-mouth. It seems that the Austria Haus was simply trying to make more money on a light week-end instead of offering superior guest service.", "title": "Comfortable property but just ok service", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "dls515", "date": "December 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147688778}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012", "text": "I loved it!
