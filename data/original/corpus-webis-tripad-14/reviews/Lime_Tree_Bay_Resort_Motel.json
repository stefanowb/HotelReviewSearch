This place is awesome. Beautiful, layed back in the middle of the Keys so you don't have to go to far to Key West to check out the action or Key Largo to check out John Pennekamps reef. It is right on the Gulf of Mexico....well the west side of Florida.. They call it the bay but it is the Gulf. Beautiful sunsets! Free Kayaks and bikes, two little convenience stores and deli's across the street. Very clean well maintained property. I almost don't want to tell anyone about it so they will have room for me when I come back!!!!! We got a waterfront king with full kitchen for around 268 (including tax) for two nights. That is 116 a night. We drove down to Key West on Sunday July 14th and stopped at each hotel we were thinking about staying after our two days in Key West. Post Card Inn, Pelican Cove, Drop Anchor, ect...then we got to Lime tree and right away said to ourselves this is it. I don't care what the rooms look like. Well, we booked and came back two days later and were very impressed with our room. We are actually still here. I am typing right now sitting under there tiki huts right on the gulf. Their wifi actually works great in our room and we are about as far away as you can be from office. So excited to find such an awesome gem. I remember reading a post that said ac was too loud. We turn ours all the way down because it was too cold last night with ac on so in the morning we kicked it back up and it was loud for a few minutes then went to a quiet hum. Didn't bother us at all but I do fall asleep with tv on. There is a place to get into the gulf to swim and snorkel, there is a dock to fish or sit and there pool is beautiful. There are hammocks and lounges all over the place......Totally Love this little gem!!!!!!!!", "title": "Wow what a great little hidden gem", "user": "flchristine", "date": "July 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167918118}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "See below for my review under tips for travelers....Could be a darling place to stay if cleaner and maintained better.

It was great because it has its own parking under the unit. (Units 1 and 2 have 2 parking spots each.) The townhouse is 3 stories; first floor was our catch all. We kept our fishing and snorkel gear there out of the way of traffic which kept tracking sand throughout the place to a minimum! The second floor was a bedroom, full bath, kitchen, dining/living room and a large balcony overlooking canal. The 3rd floor was a bedroom with full bath leading off of the room and a master bedroom with a balcony looking over the canal. Our unit was exceptionally clean and fully stocked. It even had its own BBQ gill. I wish that I had brought more food to cook. We made a trip to the grocery store, about a 20 minute drive to Marathon, to pick up supplies so that we could cook our fresh caught fish. It was to die for!
