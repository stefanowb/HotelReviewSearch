We travel extensively and for a B&B Moonstruck can put many a 5 star hotel to shame. We spent three nights there in Pan room which was beautiful. It has magnificent views from the private balcony, a lovely sitting area, super four poster bed, a decanter of sherry and a bathroom with Neroli amenities and a good variety of towels. Breakfasts are excellent with an extremely good choice of hot and cold dishes. Moonstruck is in very easy walking of the village with its shops and restaurants. Do take a torch with you at night as there are no street lights. Karen and her staff make this a very memorable place to stay and yes, we would return tomorrow!", "title": "Fautless", "user": "Sauvarin", "date": "November 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185037334}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we visit South Africa,we like to stay at a combination of new places and old favourites...we always plan our trip around Moonstruck!
