The hotel is beautiful and the best super comfy. The staff is very nice and accommodating. The girl at the gift shop was great not to mention what a cute town it is for shopping especially. We didn't venture out for dinner instead had guacamole and chips and the bar and it was very yum. By the way, the prices in the gift shop were surprisingly great considering it was the hotel's gift shop.
