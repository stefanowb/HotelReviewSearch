This hotel is perfect in everyway, the area is fab, within walking distance to all the downtown areas. The F and V subway lines are just across the road so everything in the whole of New York is easily accessable. The staff on the desk were very friendly (such a change for us, usually the most we get is a grunt in midtown!!...oops!!) The room itself was good, very comfy bed, flat screen plasma, ipod dock, free wifi internet, nice bed linen, clean bathroom, fridge and microwave!! We enjoyed Sugar for brekkie and the italian in Wholefoods was pretty awesome too!!

I was in-town for a concert and spent 3 nights here and all I can say is WOW. The hotel looked brand new, had the ambiance of a W but with unmistakable feel of a B&B...unique combo and combined with the location it truly is a GEM. I am planning another trip to NYC in the next couple of months and will look no futher than the GEM (and no I do not work for the Hotel; I am a real customer who was truly impressed and i feel I need to rave about a hotel when i have been blown away). Also, forgot to mention the service; we arrived late, after 1am, and received a warm greeting by the night auditor. He suggested a few great places in the area and everyone was spot on.

And dont forget they clobber you for tax on everything too! The Gem though is a small hotel, and the service they give is excellent. Antony on the front desk was incredibly helpful in recomending places to eat (Sugar diner 2 blocks away on Allen and East Houston is brilliant food, and open 24/7, pefect for breakfast and late night cake!). The rooms are small, but that didn't bother us too much as we were out most of the time. They have free wireless internet, Flat screen TVs, coffee percolators in each room, and although they don't have a restaurant they are happy for you to have food ordered up to the room from any takeout. The location was good too, so much is within walking distance, and the metro is close too. It isn't actually in SoHo, it's really on the edge of the Lower East Side, but the main shops of SoHo are only 10 mins walk away, little Italy and Chinatown is 5 mins walk, and Wahington Square Park is about 15 mins walk. We even walked down to the Finacial district to the WTC Site in about 30mins, although our feet hurt quite a bit after that- make sure you wear comfy shoes, there's a LOT of walking in New York! This wasn't the best hotel I've ever stayed in, but it was clean and comfortable and good value, which is what matters after all.
