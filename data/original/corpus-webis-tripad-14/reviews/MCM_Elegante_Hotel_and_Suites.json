The hotel is 12 min from downtown. The hotel has a free shuttle service from both DFW airport and Love Field which was really nice so we didnt have to rent a car. The price of the hotel was cheap $52 a night through hotels. The hotel itself is nice and clean. The rooms were decorated nicely. and clean. The hotel staff kept checking to make sure our stay was satisfactory and made themselves available if we needed them.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 14, 2005", "id": 3272690}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Enjoyed my stay!!!", "text": "The hotel is right by restaurant row and a movie theatre. The shuttle drivers take you to the restaurant of your choice (Joes crab shack, chilis, red lobster, humperdinks, pappa deux seafood etc...) That was nice. I would recommend tipping the drivers $1 -2 as a courtesy. The shuttle drivers will go out of their way to get you where you want to go, they are friendly and helpful with tourist type questions.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 11, 2004", "id": 2696395}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Worst place I ever stayed", "text": "I would recommend going to down town and going to the JFK museum at the book depository building in the west end market. It costs about $8 (with coupon from hotel) per person. It was very interesting to see such history, to be there. I am in my early thirties so I wasnt even around during this time, but I can only imagine and to see the footage from that day gave me goose bumps. It was interesting to learn the history behind it all. I some how thought the \"grassy knoll\" would have been bigger. Beware of scammers down by there trying to get you to buy a tour, dont do it. Take the day and walk around down town and the market, it was cool. My husband and I walked from the Book Depository building up two blocks to Ross st and then all the way down ross to Aknard (just past the Fairmont hotel) to the M LINE Trolley (which is free) and we rhode the Trolley to the Hard Rock Cafe (on mckinney st) this is the place to be there are nice shops. We also got back on the trolley going down mckinney to the Westend village (this is the place to do shopping it is a very nice area with nice exspensive shops and cute out of the way restaurants ) it is in the Turtle Creek area where a lot of wealthy people live.
