However, the location is on a busy road which causes a great deal of traffic noise. The hotel has double insulated windows, that when closed shut out the noise, but the room air conditioning could not keep the room cool enough for comfortable sleeping. The bed was also very hard, thus our nights sleep was poor. The hotel staff were helpful but no one was at all friendly. Breakfast was fine and were we able to find a good parking spot on the street adjacent to the hotel. The area is unremarkable except that there is a large university nearby and since it was a Friday night there was much drinking in the nearby beer bars.
