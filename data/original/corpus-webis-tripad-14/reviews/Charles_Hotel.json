From a location point of view, it couldn't be better. The hotel management seems to apply the priniciple of \"location, location, location\" and does little else to justify the exorbitant, big city prices it charges for so little extra in return. The real kicker with this property is the dichotomy of price and quality. This may be all about the economics, stupid, because the other hotels in the Harvard Square vicinity are not terrific. It is, however, painful to be paying top dog prices for what is clearly middle of the road. It seems that free cookies and coffee, available during the Harvard graduation, are management's idea of going the extra mile. The staff are not long on smiles, and at the prices we paid to be close to Harvard Square for the graduation, I want friendly. The check-in clerk, Hiyat, was particularly disagreable. This being said, the manager of the business centre was exceptionally helpful, as was the concierge. Rooms at the Charles have not changed for the past 4 years, and they are showing their age. The furniture is worn, and could use an upgrade. Water pressure is an issue, and the lighting in the bathroom has been a consistent issue for many of our stays here (ie the sconces on either side of the mirror don't seem to work). While Wifi is complementary, it is exceptionally slow. The one major positive aspect of this hotel is its association with a great health club facility, Wellbridge. Surprisingly, access for guests is free.
