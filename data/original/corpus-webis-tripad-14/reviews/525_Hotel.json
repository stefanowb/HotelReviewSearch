(see review on Hotel levante). I had stayed in Los Alcazares 3 years ago in an apartment and was not overly impressed but as we needed to find somewhere to stay at short notice and fancied a coastal resort we decided to give it a try. The hotel 525 was not built last ime I was there but found it on trip advisor and it far outweighed my expectations!The location is excellant near to airport {not too near} 5mins from beach area good local restaurants (try the El Patio} The hotel rooms are well appointed modern decor we had a suite worth the extra cost. The staff were helpful . The bar was stylish and comfortable we did not try the restaurant and we didnt see anyone else in there (it was early and had just opened}.The spa was fine my husband had amassage which was good Altogether avery enjoyable stay we hope to return!

Also the sun beds on the top of the roof beside the pool looked good, but definitely not comfortable. There is also an outdoor jacuzzi beside the pool and a smart indoor one with a great view - it is the tallest building in the area. Beach is a few minutes walk away.
