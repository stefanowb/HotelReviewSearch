The inside however is inviting, and our room was lovely. Because we were celebrating our 10th anniversary we chose the most expensive room, but I think as long as you stay on the water side all of them are good (I say waterside just because the view is so amazing!) We had a nice sized room w/ a fireplace and a large bathroom w/super roomy Ultra bath. The water view was wonderful from both inside the room and on the balcony. We saw many birds, including a bald eagle right from the back lawn. Watching the water flow by was certainly very relaxing. We attended a food and wines of Spain weekend, which was a special event at the inn. The food was gourmet and the different wines were very good. We certainly learned about spanish wines and will look to buying them in the future. The inn is very casual as it's a boating community. The other couples that we met were really nice and we enjoyed talking to them while at the inn's bar. The inn is sizable enough to not feel like you are the only people there w/ the inn keepers, but small enough that you get personal attention from the staff, who were friendly and approachable.", "title": "Refreshing lack of chintz", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SJKS", "date": "September 5, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5770000, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The food", "disliked": "\u2014 The price"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006", "text": "The inn is about 15 minutes from St. Michaels.

When we arrived, the parking lot was entirely made of mud and very difficult to avoid. I was shocked by what the hotel looked like - I had assumed from the website that it was more upscale than it actually is. It is in need of a repainting & looks quite weathered. Upon stepping into the lobby, it also appeared worn and slightly decrepit. Our first view was of two waitresses or serving staff members having a cigarette together behind the building. We walked into the small bar area where a bartender was fixing drinks. He didn't welcome or talk to us, but simply carried on with his business. He left the bar area to deliver the drinks and then did not return for the remainder of our visit. Another gentleman came in with a pitcher of water and asked if we were there for a drink. He mentioned that he was serving drinks to a larger party outside and we would have to wait for a drink. We mentioned that we didn't mind and asked if we could have drinks outside. He explained that he wanted to leave the outdoor space for the party to spread out if they wanted. Note that all of the outside tables & chairs were empty except those to the far left on the inn. He said we could have a drink inside thereby defeating the purpose of us wanting to watch the sunset & enjoy the weather.", "user": "Jeff_Cynthia", "date": "October 5, 2008", "id": 20651116}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We didn't want to leave!", "text": "We had been considering having dinner at the Inn, but the dining room was completely empty on a Friday night at 7:40 PM????

Our girls are a few years out of college (they are still willing to be seen with us and hang out with us in public, for which we are eternally grateful, and much-blessed). All four of us lead busy lives and work hard to make our livings. At least once a year, we seek an opportunity to spend time together and enjoy one another in a setting that affords us refuge, an unhurried pace, and a measure of peace. This was our first visit to Tilghman Island Inn; it won't be our last. The food is absolutely superb, the atmosphere relaxing, the owners and staff friendly, sincere, genuine, attentive, and warm. We did not take our dogs (the place is pet-friendly) but we enjoyed throwing the tennis ball to Jasmine, the standard poodle who is the inn's unofficial (or maybe she is the official) ambassador of good will. We had thought about staying in nearby St. Michaels, about 10 miles away. We're very glad we stayed on Tilghman (though we did enjoy a great dinner at Bistro St. Michael's one evening); also liked the quaint 1950s-style luncheonette on Tilghman called Two If By Sea (this is not a recreation of a 50s luncheonette--this is the real thing). Tilghman Island Inn is a pleasant blend of the intimacy of a B&B with the amenities of a larger hotel (it has about 20 rooms). We were blessed with good weather throughout our short stay; the sunsets alone made the visit worthwhile. We were also blessed to stay in a place where the management and staff take pride in taking care of people as well as taking care of details. That kind of effort always shows.", "user": "pups", "date": "May 8, 2008", "id": 15822390}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Inn is located near the end of Tilghman island, Maryland. Fairly isolated and quiet, right on the Chesapeake Bay. This inn is VERY dog friendly. The staff is very helpful and friendly as well. We stayed on the lower floor which I believe are the dog friendly rooms, since the dogs are not allowed upstairs. Dogs are not permitted in the dining room or the pool area. But they are allowed in (and at) the bar and on the deck. We had dinner with our dogs in the bar. There are two small tables in the bar area for as well as seats at the bar itself and a piano for requests for the piano player. There are also seats near the fire place for relaxing as well. While in the bar you can see and hear the house bird, I believe it is a cockatiel named Gwen. You will also see the house dog, a standard poodle named Jasmine. We did not eat in the restaurant, but I could see it was very nicely appointed with many paintings from a local artist. The food was excellent. The bar serves an ala carte version of the dining room menu. A bit pricey, but still top notch. The rear deck, boat dock and lawn area were all clean and well kept. There are a number of Adirondack style chairs on the lawn for relaxing while watching the sunset. The deck has several tables with umbrellas. There is also an outside bar.
