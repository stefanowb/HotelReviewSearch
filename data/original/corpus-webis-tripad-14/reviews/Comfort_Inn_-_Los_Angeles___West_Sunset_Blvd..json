I guess the neighborhood isn't great but they have taken every precaution to make it safe by installing security cams and secured parking. Although the carpeting in the hallways needs replaced, the rooms were very clean, updated, and roomy. The high speed internet access was great and very fast. The hotel even had an ethernet cable that I borrowed since I didn't remember to bring mine. (I'm actually using it to write this review!) Location is good - about 15 minutes from downtown and Hollywood and Universal.

This hotel is right in the Silverlake/Echo Park area, and is in a great central location to Hollywood and the 101. We ran into no traffic, and while my husband was working, I was able to enjoy the neighborhood. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and there was underground parking that was kept locked at night. There is available DSL and what looks like a decent Thai restaurant open late downstairs (I didn't try it). I would definitely stay here again.
