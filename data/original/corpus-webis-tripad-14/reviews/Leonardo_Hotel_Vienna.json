If you like to walk just in twenty minutes you will be at the Museums Quartier. My room was very clean, good amenities and the breakfast fantastic (the only problem - they didn't have a toaster... I was really surprised with that... but it ok); the staff was very helpful, specially the young lady working there around 7pm on Friday 01/18 and the young gentleman who followed her schedule (sorry I forgot all their names).

Continental breakfast buffet with a selection of bread, yoghurt and cerial as well as fruit and veg, plus, as we're in Austria, a variety of different sausages to choose from. --- There is no (free) Wi-Fi in the rooms though. Which is somewhat disappointing. You are, however, free to use the internet on one of three computers lined up in the hotel lobby. Which we did each morning planning our itinerary. --- Despite all this sounding well and fine, our stay at The Leonardo was slightly tarnished by the fact that our room, curiously enough, had a door connecting it the room next door, albeit a locked one, rather than a fully soundproof wall. On the first night especially, that meant disrupted sleep. There weren't any problems the following nights, though, as the hotel staff, we learned, had asked the people next door \"to keep down the temper\". --- So would we come back? Yeah, I think so. Had it not been for the aforementioned minor hickup we would probably have given the hotel a five-star rating.
