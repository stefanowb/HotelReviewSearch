It was clean, modern, nicely decorated, with all the amenities you would need. The air conditioning worked perfectly. The cleaners came every few days to clean and also change the sheets and towels, which was great. But the best thing was the outside space. It is awesome. Lots of loungers with parasols, a lounge area with sofa and chairs, a table and chairs, and an infinity pool. The view out over Lourdas bay is breathtaking. It was such a nice place to hang out. It was plenty big enough as well. The Ionian Beach villa was very nice as well. It has less shade but a slightly better view over the bay. I preferred Ionian Sands as I liked all the greenery and there was more shade.", "title": "A quiet chilled out location.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "busylizzieRomford", "date": "August 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 73585470}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "There are steps through the trees down to the Ionian Sun pool area with bar.

We often went in the morning to have a coffee and the kids would play in the pool. It's a good sized pool, and there always seemed to be loungers available, it wasn't too busy. We never had food there so I can't comment on that. They also serve drinks and have ice creams. Belle behind the bar was very nice, yes, she can be moody but she's a nice lady. In general we preferred the pool in our villa as it was more private and relaxing.

The beach is very wide, and there was never a problem getting loungers or anything, it's not too busy. It's a bit pebbly, and there was some kind of fish in the shallow water which kept nipping at my ankles! But not leaving marks or anything, just annoying. However, by far a better beach is Trapezeki beach, which is just around the corner, a short drive. It is gorgeous, all sandy, shallow water for very far out, and a really cool beach bar with great music. It is such a better beach - forget Lourdas beach, go to Trapezeki, trust me! You can park your car just by the beach. There may be a way to walk there around the headland as well, I'm not sure.", "title": "Ionian Sun - Lovely place!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Chillaxilicious", "date": "July 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71031698}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 4, "very good": 24, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 78}, "aka": "Ionian Sun Apartments And Villas Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.166666666667}
