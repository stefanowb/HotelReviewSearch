We wanted to see as much as we could so decided to stay in Lauterbrunnen that way we could tackle Murren, Gimmelwald, and Schilthorn one day; returning to our hotel in Lauterbrunnen then Wengen, Jungfrau another day, and Grindelwald yet another. The Silberhorn was perfectly located about 1/2 block from the train station in Lauterbrunnen. We ended up getting a room that had an extra living/TV room (we had not expected). We also had a garden area outside with a table. The bathroom had a shower and a bathtub! The breakfast (came with the cost of the room) was superb with eggs and sausage as well as the regular fruits, breads, cereals and expresso/kaffe machine. It was the best experience we have had in a long time and we travel quite a bit. The people were extremely warm and welcoming. I highly recommend this hotel. Be sure you do not confuse this with the Silberhorn Hotel in Wengen (Best Western).

The fish dishes and salads were very good, but we\u2019ve had much better rosti elsewhere in Switzerland. The rosti, as in other LB restaurants, seemed greasy, salty and not crisp.
