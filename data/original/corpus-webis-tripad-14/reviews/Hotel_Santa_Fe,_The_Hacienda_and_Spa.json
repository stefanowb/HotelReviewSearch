This property has a nice small intimate feel to it and yet has the services of a larger hotel, including a terrific spa. The staff almost without exception goes above and beyond without being intrusive. Eloy at the front desk goes out of his way to make you feel welcomed, and nothing is too big a problem to handle. Nothing was ever a problem for Eloy, he always met every request cheerfully. The waitresses in the restaurant were always happy to help out, even with my challenging dietary restrictions. They didn't mind at all getting the kitchen to make a variation on a menu item so I could eat it. At dinner time, they never glared when asking for multiple refills of bread or drink, always happy to accommodate. Breakfast here is excellent and while the buffet is fine, I recommend the hot items on the menu, which I felt were very reasonably priced. I think the hotel has one of the better breakfasts I've had during a hotel stay. I highly recommend getting a junior suite over a room, the living area of the junior suite makes all the difference. I was happy to have a mini-bar with fridge and a microwave to boot. I just felt really at home here. I had writers come up to my suite and the front desk was always happy to phone housekeeping to do an early make up of my room so it was ready for my visitors. Really, this property felt like a home away from home. It's a ten minute walk to the historic plaza. But what's really cool is they have a London style cab that will shuttle you around town. (Be sure to tip, though the service is free). I also tipped the maid 5 dollars a day, and you know it was much appreciated and my room was always cleaned to perfection. The trick in always staying at a hotel is letting people know you appreciate their effort with a thank you and a tip that's deserved. There is construction currently going on near the back of the hotel and you might want to ask for a room away from the construction. I was away from the construction and could not hear it at all. Not in the slightest. Definitely definitely get a balcony room and again go for a junior suite. I was very happy here and was sorry to leave. Oh by the way, some have had negative comments about the bed sheets being rough, I thought they were just fine, and the bed was very comfy, didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. The towel supply was excellent. All in all a hotel in the city section of Santa Fe that is intimate, friendly, and homey.

Not close enough to walk to Plaza, the shuttle was always, and quickly, available. The continental breakfast was nice, in a lovely room overlooking the Santa Fe Railtrain, Santa Fe Basin mountains and local developing tourist area. There was a beautiful fireplace and a Christmas tree in each room of the Hacienda section. We were lucky to see a beautiful snowfall while there and it was a lovely postcard trip. They even provided a wheelchair for my mother to vist the Plaza. I am a real critic, but I had no complaint about this visit. Photos on web site were just as we found it.

Housekeeping was excellent and the basic facilities offer everything you would need. The Hotel is a little further from the Plaza than many of the other hotels but is is very quiet and the two authentic purple \"London \" taxi cabs provide free shuttle service to and from most all Santa Fe attractions and restaurants. This was a very convenient feature and we never had to wait more than 7 or 8 minutes to be picked up. This was a big plus for us. The decor and ambiance of the Hotel is awesome and very authentic. We were very satisfied and would enthusiastically recommend this hotel.

The room is very nice with a very large bed (comfortable) and one of the best things was the balcony thru french doors to the outside. It was wonderful in the mornings. The bathroom is small - but I don't like anyone else in there when I am - so who cares. We purchased breakfast with our room rate. My husband went down every morning and had a full breakfast and I came later and had fruit. In the evening, the lounge was very nice. Try the fruit passion margaritta.
