Geronimo and his staff at Gran Tortuga were amazing along with the food. The staff at Don Pablo's went the extra mile to make my friends birthday special. The new beds were great and maid service was wonderful. Two surprises, Rafael at the Seafood ala carte elevated the dining experience with his service. Daniel at the Mediterrean, however was not ready for \"prime time\" My husband and I are home based Travel Agents and love accompanying clients to Grand Bahia.

The place was clean, the food was decent for a buffet, and the premises were all well kept and nice. However, going to this place you should bear in mind that it is a gated resort of industrial scale i.e. 8000 tourists in the middle of nowhere with its own shopping malls and poor connection to the outside world. So, basically you're there with all the other tourists sipping margaritas and you could be in Vegas just as well as in Mexico. We also had a room facing the motorway (so please specify you don't want this) and as a consequence we never used the balcony and it was noisy. Further the beach was a 15 minute golf cart ride away ( so saying it's on the beach is quite a stretch). Personally I would not recommend this resort or much any of the other on the Riviera Maya as it's such an industrial venture, which is also very bad for the local communities and the environment (they don't benefit from the tourism at all as all the money is spent inside these monstrous hotels).", "title": "mass tourism on industrial scale", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "vacationingwithfamil", "date": "December 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 148223014}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I have gone to this resort 3 times now and each time I have seen it with different eyes.Each time was in December around the same time.

Yes, as the previous reviews state, it is huge but it is absolutely spotless, lush and gorgeous. The rooms, restaraunts, lobbies, pools, etc were imaculate. We will be returning to this resort next February as we had our trip slightly interrupted this year. On day #2 at 7:30 in morning my husband slipped on the floor at the Akumal restaraunt (wet floors due to the tropical storm the night before) and he totally separated his collarbone and was rushed to the hospital, had surgery, and was released in time to go home. I won't elaborate on situation as living it is painful enough but my reason for mentioning this is to make people aware that they need to be careful on the floors at this resort. Prior to coming on this trip I did read about other people encountering slips and/or falls but really didn't pay much attention. The floors are cleaned and polished at night and we realize that with a little dampness or even beach sand they can become quite dangerous. The floors are beautiful and clean but my suggestion to the resort is that they invest in some runners to put down after a rain or showers to assist the people who are not accustomed to this danger.

We had 2 rooms which were just across the landing from each other which we requested from the tour operator so this was great (I was expecting to have to negotiate a change when we checked in as usually requests seem to get ignored!!). The only downside to this free upgrade is that we were then based in the Coba Hotel which is the only one of the three that is not actually on the beach requiring you to catch a hotel shuttle there. This was the only downside because I love the beachbut to be honest could not be bothered to get on the shuttle all the time to go from the nice quiet pool in the Coba (our usual base) to the beach. My wife is not bothered with the beach, so most holidays we have we usually find a quiet spot by the pool under a palm umbrella that is within easy walking of the beach so I can go sailing and snorkeling.

The water was just so clear you could see for miles and I have taken a lot of film and phtos of the fish. You are a bit restricted where you can swim because of the rocks/coral but it is still very nice. I was a bit worried because people mentioned the manmade sand bars that are laid in the water to stop sand errosion. We had visited the Bahia Principe San Juan (Dom Rep) a few years ago and these were really obtrusive and spoilt the view of the sea. These are not like that at all and are almost unoticeable. I did not do much Catermeran sailing here though which was a shame as this is usually a mainstay of my holiday. The reason for this was the location of the Watersports centre. By the time I got the shuttle from the Coba hotel in the heat, andthen walked the 300 metres or so along the beach to the Watersports centre then to be told that I had to come back in a couple of hours or the next day because no Cat was available I was knackered. Other hotels I have been at (including the Bahia Principe chain), you can book a day or two in advance and al;o a couple of bookings so that you know you can sail when you arrive.
