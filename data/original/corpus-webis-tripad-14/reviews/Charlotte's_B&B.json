We were greeted at the door by Charlotte after arriving from Dehli airport and were given a lovely refreshing drink. Charlotte had aranged all our taxis and had pre booked our train tickets to Agra before we arrived. She also arranged for us to be picked up in Agra and and taken to the Taj Mahal and Red Fort. The driver was a God send as Agra and surrounding areas can be quite daunting. During the tour and after returning to Dehli Charlotte kept in touch to make sure we were both ok. Her BnB is in an excellent location for using the metro which is about a 5 minutes walk away. We had a wander round on the first night and found it quite an eye opener but never felt threatened or unsafe. We returned on a pedal powered rickshaw which made a nice change. We cannot praise Charlottes highly enough, and highly recommend it. If you are planning a stay in Dehli this is the place to go. One word of warning, if you are catching the train at Delhi do not get conned by official looking people who ask to see your tickets and then inform you they are invalid unless checked at the tourist information office. It's all a con to get money out of you. It nearly caught us out.

When one of our party got really ill on the first night Charlotte was amazing and looked after her, insisting that we go and see the Taj Mahal and she would look after our friend. She brought her food and liquids all through the day and was like a second mum! I would reccommend staying here.

Not 5 star luxury, just homey comfort. At Charlotte's you truly are staying with the family, which can be a rewarding experience, particularly for first-timers to India (like us!). The neighborhood is very safe, pleasant, and relatively central, though not actually in the middle of everything--you will need to use the metro or a tuk-tuk to get around. Most importantly, the area is completely devoid of tourists and the touts that come with them, which can be a refreshing experience for non-Indian travellers and a great way to get off the beaten path in Delhi. More than all of this, however, I would recommend Charlotte's because the hostess (Charlotte herself) is extremely gracious, helpful and enthusiastic about running her b&b.
