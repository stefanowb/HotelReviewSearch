We left the lodge at 2:45pm and were first on line to enter the park. The park is absolutely beautiful with teak trees and it is less dense in comparison to Kanha. There are rolling hills (small ones) and lots of watering holes. The jungle here is absolutely scenic. It is warmer than Kanha so the drives are very pleasant. There is a route-system which your vehicle is assigned to so your naturalist has to stay on that route (which can make it difficult if a tiger is by a different route) but in all of this - there is a huge element of chance. We shared a vehicle with another family which saw tigers in the morning. One while driving and another w/cub(s) on elephant back. We unfortunately didn't see any tigers during our stay. We heard all of the alarm calls but missed out on the beautiful tiger. Nevertheless, we were not disheartened. The wilderness and nature itself sufficiently awed us. We saw a mongoose, plenty of birds, deers and scenic backwaters. The drives here are shorter than the ones in Kanha (since you're assigned to a route, there's just so many times, you can drive back and forth) which makes it easier on you. You depart at 5:45am after being served coffee/tea or juice (there are cookies if you need something more substantial). You get back to the resort an hour to two before noon and are served a scrumptious breakfast. You can order whatever you like. After the evening drive, you can go to the kitchen for an interactive cooking experience. I watched the first night while the chef demonstrated how to use some basic indian spices. You get to taste of course! Dinner was always very delicious. There was such a huge selection served! On our last evening, the staff arranged a surprise for us, under the guise that we were going to see a flying squirrel, only to lead us to a private dinner in the jungle. It was absolutely romantic and above the call of duty to make our stay special.
