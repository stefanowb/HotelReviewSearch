We took along our parents and siblings for a group total of eight. The rooms are up-to-date and well decorated with a touch of asian flare. We made good use of the kitchens, cooking all but two dinners in our units. The kitchen is well stocked for basic cooking needs. We also were able to pack light and use the in-unit washer and dryer. The two bedrooms are separated by the kitchen and dining area which nicely kept noise down. The master has a king bed, double sinks, a very deep jetted tub, and a separate shower with 5 shower heads. The other bedroom has two double beds and is right next to the other bathroom which has a nice but more basic shower. The living room sofa folds out into a queen bed. My brother-in-law used it and had no complaints. The dining room table comfortably seats 6, but we always ate on the lanai which had a 4 seat table and two lounge chairs. The view of the golf course was very nice but we decided if we stay here again we will probably just get the basic unit without the upper level golf course view and save those extra points. The grounds are so beautiful with palm trees everywhere that you can't really get a bad view.

It is great, the hotel is huge, you can take a boat from one side of the hotel to the other, or go across on the monorail which is a bit slow but relaxing. There is several pools, especially a adults only pool which was brilliant, no children allowed, There is also a lagoon where you can see the fish and turtles swimming underneath you which was amazing! There was several weddings on while we was there which looked gorgeous. Everyhting about the hotel was fabololus, we had our breakfast included in the price in our stay which was a bonus, as it woukd of cost us $50 every morning, The resturants were set at a resonable price especially for the food, Only downside is, if you want lunch at the pool only a few bars do lunch, or you gotta trek to find a bar. Maids were very good our room was always clean by 11am in the morning, with clean towles, The staff was very friendly and offerd us an extra room for our last day, as we only flew at night, there was no entertainment on at night, and i would not recomend the louiw, (where the girls dance with grass skirts), it wasnt worth $90 by any means. If you are going to book this hotel then book it online not through ur travel agent as they wanted o charge is$1000 for a week, and we got it for $500 each for the week inc breakfast. Amazing hotel would definaltey recomend it to friends.

The Lagoon is also warmer than most of the pools at the resort! The snorkelling is wonderful - there are numerous sea turtles, eels, and pretty fish to look at. Also the dolphins are spectacular. If you can afford it - do the swim with the dolphins. Also a hit were the water slides - there are 2 and they are really fun for all ages.

We ended up taking the shuttle a few times over to the Hilton Waikoloa Village Beach Resort to walk around, eat, snorkel in the lagoon, and swim in the pools. The lagoon really isn't much for snorkeling. It can be dark and murky in places but does have some fish and sea turtles in it. One of the sea turtles even swam after me trying to eat my yellow bikini (they eat yellow leaves in the lagoon and thought I was also food).
