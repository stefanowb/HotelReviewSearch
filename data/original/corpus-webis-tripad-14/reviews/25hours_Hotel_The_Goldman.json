The price was also optimal considering a convention started the same day (which means prices at the hotels in Frankfurt become absolutely ridiculous!) Breakfast in the hotel was very good as well although a bit small in my opinion. One negative aspect is that the bathroom in my room (Paris) was a bit cramped.
