It is a beautiful property on truly one of the best family beaches on the island. We were there two weeks - the first week we saw whales and dolphins and tons of marine life snorkeling right on the beach. We saw an eel, thousands of reef fish, green sea turtles and . . . 1 4' white tipped reef shark. It was amazing. The second week the waves picked up a bit and so the snorkeling wasn't as good but the kids had a ball riding the waves (our children are 2, 4 1.2 and 7) The property is beautiful, the rooms very comfortable and quiet. The kitchen is stocked in equipment but there are no spices or condiments. The BBQ's are a plenty and I have no idea what these people are talking about getting lost on the property?! My 4 year old can find his way around just fine. Weird. Anyway, I have been to Maui over 20 times in my lifetime and this is by far the nicest and most family friendly place we have ever stayed. Oh, one note. I inadvertantly left my cell phone in the room upon leaving. I was fairly upset as one could imagine, but I called the next morning at about 7am Maui time and the housekeeper had found it, turned it in to security and I had it back in my hands on Tuesday. I was truly amazed by that.
