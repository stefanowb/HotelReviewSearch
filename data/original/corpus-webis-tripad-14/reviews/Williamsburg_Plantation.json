I did call management at Williamsburg Plantation and was assured that any problems that they had they would rectify but they did not expect any. We travelled to Williamsburg a little nervous but we were pleasantly surprised. Our unit (205B) was spotless with everything we needed present. The staff was very attentive.

Now, 23 years later, it is an annual trip we take with our children. Once we found Williamsburg Plantation, I stopped booking other hotels with the exception of one year....and the next year we were back! It is clean and the two bedroom units are very roomy and comfortable. After a tiresome day of touring and theme park visits, it has become our refuge to refuel for the following day. Definitely a much superior option to a hotel room when traveling as a family. We have never used any of the nice ammenities other than the pool or participate in the scheduled activities...just too many wonderful things to do in the area!

The resort was very nice, the outside looked like apartments and was fully equipted with everything, kitchen and laundry facility right inside. We never went out for breakfast and stayed in one night and used the BBQ pits right outside the rooms. We went grocery shopping for food and drinks right down the road. There was a trash recepticle close by. The rooms were very clean and had everything we needed in them. The outside pool was always busy but that was expected and there was a kiddie pool for our toddler, we never went to the indoor one. It was close to all the attractions and all the restaurants and the staff was very helpful. they also had wonderful activities for the whole family.

We have stayed in the area before and are Marriott time share owners. This resort is no where near the same quality as a Marriott. The resort's appearance overall was just average, no sprinkler system, weeds on the property etc. The room was clean, but was in much need of a renovation. The couches were ripped, carpets slightly stained. There was an odd stagnant smell when your first came into the hallway of the unit, probably from other people cooking in other units. The air condition unit worked well, but was so loud it was difficult to fall asleep at night. In a one bedroom unit, you only get a queen sized bed which gave me a terrible back ache, the mattress was so old. We only were given one tiny shampoo in the bathroom and when we requested more, we never got them. Luckily, we left and stayed in Virginia Beach for a few days at the Marriott Spring Hill Suites which were fine. When we returned to the unit following our Va. Beach stay the following morning, we woke up to find no water was working in the entire unit. We never received a phone call informing us that the water was being serviced and had to wait for about an hour and a half for the water to be turned back on, which delayed our entire plans for the day. Then, the following morning, we woke up to find police officers filing reports on several cars that had been keyed the night before. Could this have anything to do w/ the fact that there was no one working at the security gate the entire week? Luckily our brand new truck wasn't one of the ones vandalized and we were out of there the next day. I would recommend staying at the Marriott Ford's Colony resort, much better quality overall. Can't comment on the ammenities, pool, etc. b/c we tried our best to stay off the resort as much as possible.

CONS- murky pool, extremely crowded, no wi-fi in units, no restaurant or general store on -site, no oven (\"B\" units only have a hotplate), no grill (we had o buy one at Wal-Mart), only a few dishwasher pellets, trash bags, thin ceilings, crowded workout room (one piece of equipment was out of order all week), if you need darkness to sleep, bring dark-colored sheets to cover the windows, there re huge flourescent lights which makes it seems like daylight all night long. All in all we had a nice stay, but there are definitely some cons.

I would caution you on taking the sales presentation during your stay as it will take more than four hours of your vacation away and they are asking way to much for their units. There current sales pitch is to have you trade in your existing timeshare unit and upgrade to their location. What they fail to tell you is that you actually don't get anything for your unit. It just looks good on paper. I talked to several other people about offers they received and they were all lower than mine with a trade. The other offers were without trades. I contacted the sales person via e-mail about the inconsistency with offers and I have heard nothing back as of this date. The asking price for a four bedroom condo is around $30,000.00 for one week of timeshare. You can take a lot of vacations for $30,000.00.
