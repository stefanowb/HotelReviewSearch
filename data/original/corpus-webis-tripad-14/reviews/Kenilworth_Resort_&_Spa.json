But to begin with, we got a room of a lower category than booked, i.e. without balcony and moreover on the ground floor where everyone could look into the room, as the footpath to one of the main entries was just in front of the room. After complaining, we were offered a luxury tent or a room with balcony from the second day onwards. Although the tents look quite well equipped, we decided to take a balcony room on the second floor. The view was into the adjacent garden, quite nice, but there was noise from trucks mostly until 10 PM. The toilet flush didn't work, but it was fixed next day without the need to report. Also, two defunct light bulbs were replaced without us having to complain. We got accustomed to the room and soon felt at home, as the beds were very comfortable, there was a coffee maker with daily replenished selection of coffee and excellent tea. Mineral water was delivered daily. The housekeeping did a really good job and it was always a pleasure to enter the clean and tidied up room. There was no ironing board in the room, however the directory indicated one would be delivered on demand. Air-condition good. Laundry service very good, same day re-delivery without surcharge. The television was ok, at least CNN was available, but not BBC. The bathroom amenities were fine. No daily newspaper, but one neighbouring room always had a fresh newspaper, possibly a special arrangement? Note: In the coffee shop there is a selection of local newspapers.", "title": "Enjoyed a week of holidays", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "January 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 13073223, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 comfortable bed", "disliked": "\u2014 no BBC television"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The Beach: The hotel is located at the beach, in a distance of about 300 meters mandatory in Goa.

We had a lovely, large room with a spacious balcony facing the pools, trees, paths, and sometimes within hearing (but not sight), the ocean. This hotel is so beautiful. The open air lobby is genteel, the winding paths from the hotel toward the ocean are lovely in themselves. Breakfast was very good, lots of variety. Options to eat in the air cojnditioning, inside but with fans, or outside in the sun or shade. There were vendors on the beach which were too persistent for me. A driver named Vincent Rodriguez took us to see an ancient labyrinth and other rock carvings some distance from the hotel, which were fascinating. Our room also faced the area where food was served outside each evening, but that noise was over by about 10:00. I always travel with earplugs, just in case, but did not feel the need to use them. We liked the shack on the beach to the right for dinners. Very tasty. The spa looked really nice, but the hotel needs additional people with additional skills to fulfill all the options they offer. I would suggest trying one service and proceeding from there, rather than booking several at first, as we did. The beach was gorgeous, worth the walk. One other detail -- our flight got us to Goa quite early in the day and we were not able to check in. We had booked a room, but they did try to get us into one of the beach shacks, perhaps because it was available earlier than a room. We said no to that, although they did have the benefit of being much closer to the ocean and always being able to hear the surf. When they came to get us to check into our room, we were very happy with our choice to stay in the hotel proper. We stayed for 6 days. I would go back and stay two weeks, and explore a bit more outside the hotel than we did. Other than the vendors and the spa difficulties at the time of our visit, we did not experience any of the difficulties mentioned in the other reviews. I would suggest to the hotel that they work out an earlier check in time when possible.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 20, 2006", "id": 5368849}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "My partner and I stayed in March this year. The hotel itself is lovely. It's not a 5 star as some sites suggest but it is very nice. The pool itself is fantastic. It can be a bit of a push to get a bed by the pool but in a way it did us a favour, we would just get a couple of beds in the large grounds and use the palm trees for shade. The staff were very helpful to us, the only problem was checking in. We arrived at around 6.30 am but couldn't check in to around 12.30pm. However, they did upgrade us to a luxury tent almost on the beach for the 2 week stay.

Flights to Goa on Jet or Kingfisher are the best and if you book locally are much cheaper. I had been in touch with the hotel directly and as promised there was a representetive waiting to pick us up in a smart clean car. In our group we had 4 adults and 4 children. On arrival we were given a welcome drink and once the formalaties were taken care of we were escorted to our rooms. Our room was towards the front of the hotel above the car park (not an issue) and it was big & clean. The bed was huge and could sleep three easily, we also had an extra folding bed for our daughter still the room was not congested. Our room also had a large balcony with good cane furniture. The bathroom was a good size with the usual hotel extras including tooth brush, comb, shower gel,shampoo, moisturer and talc. These were replaced as and when. On the first night the flush faile to work and so i called down to the relevant department and within 20 minutes the in house engineer had replaced the flush and gone. The hotel has afew shops selling ornaments and various nick nacks but i am sure you could buy those at half the price in town. The breakfast in the morning is just great and we had a choice of fresh fruit, fruit juices, full English breakfast, eggs made to order, a choice of local dishes which i would recomend you try, fresh croissants & pastries. All this served with a smile always. The swimming pools are very clean and there is a kids pool with a water slide. Outside there is also a swim up bar and a covered outdoor jacuzzi. Past the swimming pool and a 3 minute walk and you arrive at the beach which is good & clean. At the beach there are afew shacks which we did not get to try unfortunately. There were a few hawkers from whom we bought good qualoity T shirts and some cheap jewellery for my daughters friends. Remember to bargain though. On one of the days we organised a banana boat ride and jet skis, this is through the hotel, the shack before you step on the beach to the right. The equipment is good,safe and value for money.
