We had been researching a place to stay near by the Historic village. Having never had the experience of staying in a Bed and Breakfast, we decided to try it out. We had googled and found A Williamsburg White House Bed and Breakfast. We loved the whole idea of the coziness of a B & B, picking out our room, being with in walking distance of Historic Williamsburg , and having breakfast provided for us! Upon arriving we immediately fell in love, the house was decorated for Christmas and looked so cozy. We were greeted by the inn keeper, he was very friendly and welcoming. We stayed in the Lincoln room. The king size bed was very comfortable, loved the separate bathrooms, and loved the area that was to resemblethe Ford Theater! The breakfasts were not only delicious but very filling. We never eat such large breakfasts! I liked knowing what was on the menu the night before. The Inn keepers were very prompt on serving breakfast, that way we could eat and get on with our day! We loved meeting other couples, many were from other parts of the country. We enjoyed the social aspect of breakfast, sitting in the dinning room together. It was a very nice way to get aquainted with the house guests! The Inn keepers were very warm, welcoming and helpful, answering any questions we might have. This was a wonderful experience for us. We would love to come back, next time we would love to bring our adult children and their spouses!!

On the way to Virginia we realized we had miscalculated our time. When we called and spoke with Debbie explaining our mistake asking if there was any way we could shift our time forward a day she said...'done'. That was the beginning of our wonderful stay at this beautiful Inn. We had selected the FDR Chamber which is separate from the main house. It was a beautiful, spacious room with a king sized bed, huge bathroom and plenty of privacy. Breakfasts were thoughtfully prepared and presented...and delicious. We did NOT need lunch! Each evening wine and yummy baked goodies were available to enjoy. The Inn is located across from the beautiful campus of The College of William and Mary. John and Debbie are gracious hosts with a great sense of humor and a lot of fun. They are available whenever you might need them as they live on the premises, which is a real plus. There is a huge library should you want to read, but with so much to see and do there was no time. Colonial Williamsburg and the surrounding area is rich in history and a very short distance away. Everyone should visit this important city. The re-enactments held each afternoon were a highlight. We had such a short amount of time to take it all in and sadly were not able to do so. We told our friends in CT and discussed taking another trip and meeting up at the 'White House'. There is no other place we would want to stay and now look forward to going back.

We stayed in the Lincoln Suite, with dual bathrooms, and everything was spot on. Breakfasts were hearty and the conversation lively, just what we would expect.

Our arrival found the door locked and the hosts unavailable until 3pm ( we waited 15 minutes on a bench outside in the gardens). Not the best start! Our room, the FDR, was in the west wing addition, and had separate entrance and considerable privacy. The room was in keeping with the house and area,was comfortable,spacious, and had a nice king sleigh bed that was very comfortable. Lighting was dim. The bathroom was functional but could have used improvements. Birds sang outside our window every morning-delightful! The house is located one kilometre from the start of the old town,and it is a very plasant stroll down the street with the William and MaryCollege to get there. The public rooms of the house were graciously decorated in vibrant colours accented with white and were quite charming. The hosts,a couple running the place for 12 years,were efficient but somewhat standoffish and inflexible. For example, on returning from an evening out and being tired from a long day, we were already undressed and on the bed when we looke at the sheet for a breakfast order. It stated that if we did not return it that night it would be assumed we did not want breakfastTthat is unacceptable for hosts of a B&B. Next morning the gentleman \\john grumbled about it, but still gave us breaskfast,though no attempt was made to accommodate the slightest variation on what he had planned. In fact, while the bed part of the deal was charming and most welcome, the breakfast part was far wide of the mark on several fronts. The lady of the house redeemed them our last morning when( having been told on arrival that breakfast was at 9am and earlier did not exist) she provided an excellent breakfast as we had asked from her and had it ready at 7am !). Overall I would recommend this B&B withoiut hesitation, but-as so often with B&Bs- feel the hosts need to be more relaxed,less stuffy and more flexible.

We were greeted by the innkeeper with, \"I noticed you didn't park in the parking space marked Republican\" and \"Say whatever you like while your here, we don't believe in political correctness\". The common area was decorated with pictures of Republican high-lights and Democrat low-lights. We especially thought the framed picture of Monica Lewinsky was in poor taste.

Once inside, we were offered a late afternoon sampling of cookies, sweets, and a variety of wines and sherrys set out for all the guests.
