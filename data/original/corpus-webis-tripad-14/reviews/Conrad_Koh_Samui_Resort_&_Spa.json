It's the way in which people deal with this that varies. I suspect many people, like ourselves, come on Hilton miles and hence are more cost conscious, if you can afford to pay for a room, you probably won't baulk at the cost of the rest of the things. If you are on a budget you can keep costs down by going to the Elements Spa for massages, shopping for snacks and booze at the mini mart and eating outside at the Green Ta'lay (which I found a bit disappointing given the Tripadvisor hype especially the building site location). There is also a massage place next to the mini mart where you can get a Thai Massage for $10.
