Hotel Eder did not disappoint! I can only reiterate what others have already said about its convenient location, helpful staff, cleanliness and value for the money. Personally, I much prefer this type of hotel with more of a friendly personalized service and comfortable local atmosphere than a larger chain hotel. Overall, I think it was perfect for our family and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.", "title": "A Wonderful Stay", "user": "dessoir", "date": "February 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 151888862}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with family", "text": "It was conveniently situated in a quiet side street close to the main railway station, and a short walk to Karlplatz and onto Marienplatz. The underground was very close as well. Very convenient for food. Well situated to any day tours departing from either the station or Karlstadt. The hotel was very clean and the staff all very friendly and helpful, they gave us directions to a laundry which although was a bit of a walk was still convenient for us. The breakfasts were very good, gave you a good start to the day. There is no lift in the building so it was a bit of a trek up the four flights of stairs with heavy bags, not that this deterred from the whole ambiance of this lovely hotel. We had a triple room which was perfect for us, a lovely clean bathroom. We would definately stay here again and recommend to friends.", "title": "Great family run hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Holmes71", "date": "January 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149363732}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel is located within the city area, walking distance to the pedestrian streets for shopping.

If you get off at the right exit, it is less than a 5 min walk to the hotel. At first, I thought that the hotel would be quite loud because of the several casinos located in this area included one just down the street from it but it wasn't loud at well. Check-in was pretty easy and my room was located past the breakfast area and into the other building. Because of reading Tripadvisor, I was prepared to walk up the two flights of stairs. Room looks just like in the pictures. Pretty basic and clean but without all of the frills (wi-fi is free - just ask for the password at the desk). The room was pretty warm so it was nice that the windows opened to get some fresh air in. Breakfast, which was included, is your traditional European breakfast - coffee / juice, cold cuts, cheese, yogurt, bread / pastries, etc. When you leave the hotel, this is also the type of place where you leave your room key at the front desk. I was glad that they asked for a name when I came back that night. If you don't mind a hotel without an elevator, I would definitely recommend this place.", "title": "Nice family run hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BayAreaTraveler6338", "date": "January 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 149039367}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Actually stayed here December 2011 with husband and 11 year old daughter ( I've taken a while to review ..oops).
