It was everything we needed and even a few extras. For a $75/night hotel we were really surprised by both the staff and amenities.

We parked our vehicle at the hotel for less than half than it would have cost at the airport, and they provided a free shuttle to the airport the next morning.

The staff was great the hotel was very clean it needed a little updating but thats to be expected from a Super 8. The room was a smoking room and yes it did smell like smoke but the room was in great shape and very clean and all of the toiletries were there and the paper products were all folded and there were plenty of towels, the linens were clean and smelled nice.

The most recent was during June when I was to have a room with two beds (I had a friend staying with me) for the week of June 4-12......The week of Fan Fair In Nashville. The hotel LOST my reservation, then said that they could give me a room with 1 bed, but at a much higher rate. Needless to say, I only stayed the nights that I was rooming alone. NOW, they have charged my Debit card for two more rooms for a night THREE nights AFTER I flew home. I am fighting them for the $142 charge on my account, but they are saying I had a reservation and was a No Show. Trust me,,,,,,,,,,I didnt have a reservation. I think they screwed up my ORIGINAL reservation and are now charging me for the wrong dates that they entered. Anyway, I have had nothing but problems with this hotel and their \"reservation\" system, and now that they have my card information, turns out they can charge my card and there is NOTHING I can do about it.

I was very satisfied with all of my experiences. This hotel has a lot of advantages and a few disadvantages. First, the advantages are that it is a clean, interior corridor hotel in a very safe business district, it has amenities like a large indoor pool, elevator, electronic locks, and a limited continental breakfast, all at a great budget price. The disadvantages are that the hotel was built in 1989 and has not had a major renovation since, there was some mold on the ceiling of the indoor pool (the ceiling was all wood) and some of the tv's only had a few channels. All in all, it is a great place to stay, just don't expect 4-star accomodations. One of the best economy hotels in Nashville. They let my parents park their car there when they flew to Phoenix for a vacation. I would definitely recommend this hotel to budget-minded business travelers or anyone looking for affordable accomodations in Nashville.
