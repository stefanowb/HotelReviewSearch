Also, only 4 people in a dorm which was great. And perfect location in valparaiso close to the elevator that can take you back up the hill after grocery shopping or to the little coffee shop overlooking the port. The breakfast was fantastic and fresh and kept going until 11am every day around the big table. I met so many interesting travellers and everyone was so friendly yet at the same time it wasn't a loud party hostel so you could get sleep in the evenings. The owners are also so friendly and lined me up with lots of maps and information. Also I arrived on the night bus at 6am and they let me sleep on their sofa bed until my dorm was ready and then fed me an enormous breakfast.
