The room was large and comfortable with a fantastic view of the Atlas Mountains beyond the well-tended gardens and pool. The kasbah-style architecture and decor seems authentic even though I believe it's a very new building. We didn't try the spa but the food was really excellent, served anywhere you like including the roof terrace (with resident cacti and great 360 degree views). My only gripes: the journey to it is along a series of extremely bumpy roads so it's slowing going, the pool looks deceptively large on photos but half of it is only 2 feet deep, and the bathroom in our room was a let down for the price: a very small bath and a pretty poor shower.

This was based purely on the good internet reviews we'd seen, plus recommendations from Moroccan business contacts. From the moment we arrived we knew we'd made an excellent choice: This two year old place is extremely well-designed, and it met all our needs. We now understand why being out in the countryside is the elegant option when visiting Marrakech. The city centre simply does not feel clean by comparison (compare the stench of horse manure at the Jamaa el-Fna square in Marrakech with the pool & gardens of the Al Mendili featuring Hibiscus, Bougainvillea and Olive groves.. it's absolutely no contest. And I don't recall seeing a single insect in 3 days at the Al Mendili). Service was excellent throughout, and owners Emmanuel and Vanessa deserve a lot of credit for assembling such a competent team of eleven staff (cleaners, chefs, pool/garden maintenance and spa service personnel all live on-site and were always there for us as and when we needed them - we chose to leave a good tip for them at the end of our stay). Amal, their tireless and versatile \"chef de service\" deserved special mention as she looked after us extremely well. You can rely on the hotel to arrange transport (Rashid was excellent), arrange outings (or golf) and recommend restaurants in town just 30 minutes' drive away. Rooms are very secure (with optional heavy shutters if required) and air conditioning units more than adequate. Do not leave without trying the Hammam/Massage combination: the cost is very reasonable and the masseuses were surprisingly good. There's ample evidence on the walls (masks and artefacts) of Emmanuel & Vanessa being raised as expat kids in Libreville. They in turn now have three kids attending the French school in Marrakech, plus a delightful one year old white Samoyed \"puppy\".
