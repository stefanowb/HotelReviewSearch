You sit up talking until late at night on every subject around the heavy wood dinner table learning and laughing. You tuck in at night with real embroidered linen sheets and listen to almost nothing - look out the wood shuttered windows and see the lightening bugs light up the olive groves.

Once we arrived (which was late at night due a transportation strike in Italy) he helped us with finding a place to eat dinner and then picked us up at the bus station and brought us back to his B&B. He routinely dropped us off each morning at the bus without our even asking. The service offered by he and Christina was top notch in every way. They are very attentive hosts and I felt I could approach them for anything. They made a delicious_complimentary_meal for us and another honeymoon couple who were staying there at the same time (home made fresh pesto on pasta with terrific wine and scrumptious mille foglie pastry with a local dessert wine)!! Christina gave us the La Limonaia wedding message written on a scroll while we were enjoying dinner. It was a fabulous evening that was completely unexpected. Breakfast was always great with lots of choices (omelettes made to order, fresh produce, meats, cheese, yogurt, scrumptious cherries, pastries, juice, coffee) and we always left full. Our spotless room was very elegant and very Tuscan--I loved it! They provide little extras like chocolates on your pillows and hanging your laundry outside the window for you. Honestly I don't know how they could have been any more attentive. If we had not already had another booking in Rome that we could not cancel, we would have stayed the last few days of our honeymoon at La Limonaia. If you are worried about getting in and out of Florence, don't. It is easily connected by a bus that runs frequently and a short walk from the bus stop to the B&B.
