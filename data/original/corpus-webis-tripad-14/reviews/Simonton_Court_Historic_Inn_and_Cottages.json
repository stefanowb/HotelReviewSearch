The main pool is located in front of the mansion where breakfast is presented every morning at 8:30 with Ice water, Tea and fruit available all day. Nice touch. All rooms have a verandah or porch facing the garden, pool or street, so you can choose whatever situation that is pleasing to you. The lanterns are left on throughout the gardens all night - appreciative of this since we departed at 5:30am. We stayed in the ORCHID. King size bed, fridge - huge bathroom with old-fashioned claw tub. Completely renovated and all very Old Florida...especially the oversize porch with lovely furniture overlooking Eaton. Huge trees give you privacy but you can still sit out and watch all the activity. The Ghost tours come by at night -so you can listen to a portion of that in the comfort of your own space.
