Really enjoyed the 2 inch dead cockroach (well, twitching and on its back anyway) that showed up in the tiny bathroom on my last day. Rooms are very small, no thermostat in the room. Since the entire building has a central air system, you either open or close the room vent. I could swear I smelled cigarette smoke coming from the vents. Quite noisy as well. My 7th floor room (the top floor) must have been directly underneath the main air conditioning unit which vibratated the walls and hummed very loudly around 1:00 am and 4:00 am. Foam earplugs are a great thing to pack with you, but I left mine in my other suitcase. Bed was small but comfortable.

Bathroom that did not function. Noisy. A Hotel Front Desk staff that had no idea what so ever as to what customer service is about. Front desk personnel that did not follow through to a manager as to problems. Food that was fair to poor, cold and sub standard. Do not eat in the Hotel try fast food you will be more satisfied. Management is non existant, customer service is no where to be found. So if you are looking for a quaint, historic, excellent service charming old hotel, with staff and management that is customer service oriented-go somewhere else. terrible is the only rating that I give this hotel.
