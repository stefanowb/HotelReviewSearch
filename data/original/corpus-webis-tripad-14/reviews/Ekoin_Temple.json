Younger monks commune here, so you get alot of interaction among them. My husband even played baseball with them in the afternoon. What a great experience. The rooms are modest but clean and bright and our room also had a small patio area that opened to a private pond. The food was great and the location was super convenient and close the cemetery.", "title": "Great people! Great Location!

There was a morning prayer service that I highly recommend even if you don't understand what is going on. The chanting monks and the whole experience is enthralling and breathtaking. After the service, there is a fire ceremony that is simple amazing. I would stay close to the door or open area though because it got pretty smokey in there.", "title": "Great experience in Koyasan", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "eatandstay", "date": "June 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7742528, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The experience of staying in the temple"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled solo", "text": "We wanted to experience at stay at a Temple in Koyasan and Ekoin was a lovely experience.
