Fantastic, creative dishes of all types -- amazing fried anchovies, shrimp, calimari, and John Dory, salads, soup, finished with a whole grilled fish that was one of the best we've ever had. We had probably 10 courses in total, splitting most of them among our group of 4. The service was great, once we made it clear to the waiter that we were putting ourselves in his hands for the night.", "title": "Wow -- an amazing experience", "user": "MikeBOS", "date": "June 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 163417448}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited May 2013", "text": "I think the disconnect with the other reviews here is that this is a place where you need to be able to let go and let them bring you whatever is best. We did have choices, but there is no written menu, and we relied on the waiter to guide us to what was best that night. If you are very picky about knowing exactly what you are going to eat, and being able to choose precisely what you want, you will not be happy here.

Everything was wrong right from the beginning. The old and stale fish antipasti as you walked in set the tone for the evening I think! The hopeless greeting before being seated at our table made me want to turn around and walk straight out again. Our waiter was so rude (and ridiculous) the entire evening.
