The location is really perfect -- a short and pleasant walk to Old Town Square etc.. and the metro stop right down the block which hooks you up to Prague's excellent public transportation system if you're going farther afield. Our room was huge, the beds were incredibly comfortable, with a clean & well-equiped bath -- all of high standard. The staff couldn't have been nicer -- falling all over themselves to please us and, most important, they seemed very happy! My Mom is a member of Hilton's \"Honors\" program, so we had access to the Executive Lounge which really added immensely to our stay as we had drinks and snacks available all day and a lovely breakfast, including smoked whitefish, smoked salmon and lovely rolls (among other things). It's a Hilton, of course, and lacks the old-fashioned character you could get at some other Prague hotels. But it''s easy and very convenient.. All and all, a cheerful and comfortable place.", "title": "Comfortable Choice in a Perfect Location", "user": "GoGirlToo", "date": "May 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 16028757, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, comfort, very friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My Wife and I stayed in Prague for 4 days in this hotel recently for my wife's birthday and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We booked the hotel and paid fully in advance on line and got a good deal. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded free of charge to the Club Level, with its access to the Executive Lounge. The staff in the hotel were extremely helpful, efficient and friendly and even surprised my wife with champagne, strawberries and card for her birthday. We have stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels over the last couple of years and while this was on the smallish side (the pool was tiny!!), the location, service, and other facilities were up there with the best of them. We ate in the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant on our last night and we were not disappointed with the food. We recently dined in the new Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Powerscourt, near Dublin and I am beginning to see a trend - the restaurant staff can be over attentive and eager to please - which can be disrupting to the meal - lay back a little ! Overall we had a great time and I would certainly recommend this hotel.", "title": "Great Hotel, Friendly Staff, Not sure about the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant", "user": "BPGDublin", "date": "April 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 15184194, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and Friendliness of Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Small pool and Gordon Ramsay Restaurant"}}], "location": {"country": "Czech Republic", "region": "Bohemia", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Prague"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 25, "average": 97, "very good": 386, "terrible": 17, "excellent": 589}, "aka": "Hilton Prague Old Town Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0965824665676, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Located in the in the centre of Prague\u2019s most desirable attractions.
