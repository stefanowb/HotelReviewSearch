This was our second time here and the second time we used Sanibel Arms West. I can't say enough about how great the property and office staff are!! Our first trip last year was for a romantic getaway. We liked it so much we brought back our young daughters, mother, and grandmother this time. Most condos (ours was C7) sleep 6 comfortably. There are also two full baths and a washer/dryer in the unit which are also great features We took advantage of the fully furnished kitchen and ate all our meals in. With 4 adults sharing the load and having a dishwasher it really didn't seem like work at all. Besides, we had an ocean front unit that had a view you couldn't get from any restaurant on the island. If you decided to book C7 and want a general idea of what the kitchen has just send me a message through Trip Advisor. While I can't imagine not having the ocean view, none of the units are far from the water. They also have bike rentals and a screened in pool that we really enjoyed.
