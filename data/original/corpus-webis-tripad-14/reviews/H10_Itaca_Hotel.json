Overall, our stay was okay. We got to barcelona at 10:00 AM and they let us check in early which was nice. THe hotel is about 5-7 minute walk from the closest subway station and since there's nothing particularly special about the street its on, it can seem like a pretty long and boring walk. There doesn't seem to be air conditioning in the rooms so I can't imagine what styaing here would be like in the middle of summer. We did like the fact that there was two computers with internet connections in the lobby. It's in a pretty quiet area. There's a groccery store about a block away which is good if you want to pick up some water or snacks cheaply. I think we paid about 160 US per night which isn't the best deal. For that money, I think I'd prefer to stay somewhere a little closer to the main tourist areas and even a little closer to a subway station.", "title": "Not bad but it's a bit of a walk", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kmstraveller", "date": "April 17, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3372056}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005", "text": "Great hotel!
