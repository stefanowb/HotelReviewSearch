Located very close to Potsdamer Platz. Five minute walk to S Bahn or bus number M41 from/to the Berlin Hbf. Check-in was quick and friendly. Rooms are small, but equipped with free wifi, tv, room has shower and toilet and small desk. Comfortable beds. Hotel is located on a side street so there is no traffic noise. Buffet breakfast is served in the morning for 7.50 euros, which is a bit on the high side, but has a fairly decent selection of cold items. Rooms have a numbered key lock so no key is necessary, just a numbered combination for opening the door. There is also a safe deposit located at reception. This is the third Ibis Budget I have stayed in and they meet the need of the budget traveler.", "title": "Another Winner", "user": "yvr1", "date": "December 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 187593202}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid.", "text": "Not very secure. The rooms are locked by a key pad and the doors don't latch very strongly when they are closed. We had checked in and then gone out for the evening. While out, someone was able to break into our room and stole our two iPads with their charging cables. We. Reported the theft to the main desk and he didn't seem surprised or concerned. Gave us directions to walk to the police station about two blocks away to fill out a report, and changed the code for our room. Didn't offer us a different room! Went to the police then returned to the hotel. The next morning we spoke to the manager. She was sorry for the theft, but was surprised to hear that the police told us it is very easy to break into rooms with a code and hook-type handle. Didn't seem to believe us. We asked her if she wanted a copy of the police report. Oh, sure. Ok. Gee, thanks for your concern! We will never stay at another Ibis hotel again!", "user": "Walkinglive", "date": "December 10, 2013", "id": 187295536}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Ibis budget category really surprised me. Hotel is at a very good location (walk distance from Check Point Charlie , Topography of Terror and public U/S transportation). Service was fantastic. Stayed there to run the 2013 Berlin Marathon.
