I was standing in front of her with my crutches when I asked this so I followed her directions only to find myself standing in front of a door with a sign pointing to the health club which was one flight down. Definitely not easily accessible with crutches. I went back downstairs, where there was a different person at the desk, who apologized and told me to walk across the street to another building and take the elevator up to the health club. Prior to booking the hotel I asked about the pool and was told it was accessible, but when I arrived I discovered that the only way to get into/out of the pool was via ladders on the side of the pool.
