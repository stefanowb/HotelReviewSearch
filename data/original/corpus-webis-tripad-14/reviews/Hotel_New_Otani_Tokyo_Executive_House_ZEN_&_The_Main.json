This is not an isolated issue as my coworkers who have stayed here several times over the last several years have attested. This will drive Americans crazy as we tend to like our AC. The western breakfast in both major cafes are *really* mediocre. About the only thing that was halfway decent were the custom made omelets. Otherwise I didn't have a decent breakfast the entire trip. Hotel is extremely spread out, exactly like Las Vegas. Each major wing of the hotel is about 150 yards apart, and it seems to get out of the hotel you need to walk about 5-10 minutes from your room. If you are dressed in a suit and in a hurry this gets old fast. While the Akasaka district offers some fun restaurants, the general area is very sleepy and somewhat boring. You'll need to get on the subway to do much.
