I guess it also helps that the place is relatively new. The room was spacious and although it is an \"international\" hotel it was Moroccan in character including the rooms. You'd be niave to assume a 5* in Marrakesh will translate to to a 5* in Europe. The facilities are there but the service falls short of the mark. The staff were upapologetic about problems and didn't have the urgency you would expect. I just think that's down to the Moroccan laid back culture rather than rudeness or laziness. The pool areas was well designed and clean. Even though the hotel was far from full sunbeds were at a premium. My suggestion would to lay your towel pre breakfast. Very unbritish but necessary . The breakfast was fine but the rest of the food for lunch and dinner was uninspiring and we ate out after the first night. I'd recommend El Fassia, Der Moha and Marrachi. The gym was well equipped but without proper ventilation or stronger air con it made it difficult to use. I didn't use the spa but the GF did and gave it the thumbs up. The location of the hotel is not great it a cab ride into the centre but at only a couple of pounds each trip its not a problem and there are a lot of cabs.
