It is difficult to believe that all appropriate rooms are unavailable at 12 but available at 14 01! That said the room (non-smoking, corner room on upper floor) was very good for the price, booked through Zuji-Singapore. Relatively spacious by Japanese hotel standards, although it helps to be by yourself. The location is convenient to the Tenjin sub-nade, but a bit of a walk (10 min+) if you alight at the subway station, and you definitely need to print off the map from Google maps to show the way underground. The internet was tops: free, fast and reliable. I was also amused at the need for a separate laundry set aside for the exclusive use of female guests, but maybe there are some quirks about male laundry users in Japan which have escaped me!", "title": "Can't Believe This Isn't Number 1 in Fukuoka..!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DanSteely", "date": "February 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 124859575}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled on business", "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights in Oct 2011, and had a great time.
