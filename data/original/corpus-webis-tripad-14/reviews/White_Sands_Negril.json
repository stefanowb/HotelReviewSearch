We had such a great time. Management was very professional and the staff was kind and sweet to us. Everybody there definitely made our 10 days in Negril very comfortable and interesting. The beach there is just amazing! If you want to experience the true Negril and if you don't want to spend all you money on were you sleep...choose White Sands!", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 14, 2004", "id": 1550703}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "White Sands - Thanks from the English girls.", "text": "Having just returned from our first trip to Jamaica for a birthday celebration, we have only praise for White Sands. The location, the accommodation and especially the staff were truely amazing. We were taken care of from start to finish, from Patrick collecting us from MoBay, Henry (the best guy around), nothing was ever a problem, Kay and the other housekeepers who cooked an amazing birthday dinner and kept the place clean and homely and Paul and Tony who made the most amazing cocktails, dangerous as they were!! Francis thanks for making our trip run smoothly. The family owned White Sands was the best place to spend a birthday celebration. 6 of us stayed in the 4 roomed villa which was better than the internet could show. We were made to feel at home and could not have asked for any more. White Sands was safe and secure and has guarantteed we will return. Having spent 10 days there we can understand why many people return year after year. See you again soon!

This made us a little nervous, but we dismissed it as paranoia. As we unpacked our things, we noticed a layer of soot on the entire floor (This is a small complaint compared to what was about to happen next). While disrobing in the bathroom on the first day, my wife was boldly violated by a peeping tom who had the audacity to try to proposition her at the same time. He slipped into the night before I could wrap my fingers around his neck. We decided to stay anyway, which was really a mistake, in retrospect (We booked the remaining nights at Rockhouse, after the incident, which later gave us the secure feeling we needed). The next day (unbelievably), while the maid sincerely expressed anguish and empathy, one of the owners there never even once apologized, nor made any apologetic gesture or remark. I was completely amazed by this. On a positive note, it was a small, but nice room for the price, and is well-situated on the beach. Perhaps security will be beefed-up once high season begins....", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 4, 2003", "id": 1435942}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "12 Days at White Sands", "text": "I stayed at White Sands this past July for 12 days with my two young kids. This was my third trip to Negril; the first for the kids. We had an excellent vacation and our stay at White Sands was certainly one of the highlights. We stayed in a one-bedroom apartment (#2), which worked out well for us. I loved having the kitchen/dining room available. Although we did eat out often, we did have many meals in. Some of the meals I prepared and others I had prepared for us in our room. We also had staff help with our laundry (very nice with 2 young kids). Although the apartments are somewhat dark, it helps keep the unit cool. The unit does have an air conditioner, but we seldom used it. The housekeeping staff kept the room very clean and did the dishes for us as well. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend using the driver from White Sands for your transportation to and from the airport. We used the driver from White Sands exclusively while we were there. Not only was he a safe driver and a valuable resource for information, but he also became a good friend to the kids and I. White Sands is centrally located on the beach, which makes it a perfect base for exploring. I am not sure when our next trip will be (the kids are already asking), but we will definitely stay at White Sands when we return.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 8, 2003", "id": 1276220}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "rest with the best", "text": "My first visit to jamaica was nine years ago and ever since it has been my vacation spot, I have been staying at the WhiteSands for the past four years and it's like going back home, the staff and owners are all warm and welcomes everyone with a hugh hug and a warm smile, the best place to be if you enjoy the beaches, I think it's more than seven miles it just goes on and on.
