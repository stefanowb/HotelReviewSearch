Not only did we get a free ride from and to the airport, but the driver also offered to take us to restaurants around the suites. We also used Liebt Way Tours to transfer us to the port, we later used their services to take us on a tour to Southbeach. Driver Paulo was very nice to us and accomomodated us in ever way. We felt like royalty our whole stay. The breakfast and happy hour food was fantastic. The suites are beautifully decorated and very roomy for my family of five, which consist of a 11 and 13 year old.

Unfortunately when we walked into the room it smelled of cigarette smoke which was unacceptable to us and Alberto called down to the front desk, got our room changed, went downstairs to get the key for our new room and moved our luggage to our new room which was smoke free and very nice. It was a one bedroom which was very clean. It was great having a kitchen with a refrigerator that we could use to store water and soft drinks and a microwave to heat up leftover food from the restaurant we ate at. There was a TV and DVD in the living room area and a TV in the bedroom. The breakfast was great and had a nice variety of items to chose from - scrambled eggs, french toast, bacon, sausages, bagels, english muffins, toast, danishes, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereals, juices, milk, coffee and tea - much more then we expected from a continental breakfast.

We are located equal distances from the beaches and some of the most popular shoopping venues of Miami. At the same time, you can easily go east and tour Biscayne Bay, or go west into the Everglades and see an alligator show. We have the most spacious suites in town, equipped with a complete kitchen. Our hot breakfast is second to none in the area, and it is complimentary, as is the social hour we host Monday through Thursday at our guest house, where you can enjoy complimentary appetizers, soft drinks, beer and wine.The staff at the Hyatt House Miami is anxious to welcome you and I look forward to meeting you in person.Gody Almonte, General Manager."}
