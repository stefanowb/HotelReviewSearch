Our room was large, modern and clean. The restaurant is very nice. We had pie and coffee there and also breakfast buffet (comes with room $5.95 value each person). It had biscuits, eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, potatoes, gravy, fruit, danish and donuts, several juices, milk. It was great! We did not go into the saloon but it looked nice. We plan to use this hotel every time we go to Oklahoma City. We had a little traffic noise from I-40 but that is true of every hotel along that strip. Nothing that kept us from sleeping.

Once we got to the hotel, we checked into our rooms. We had to go back outside and walk to the end if the hotel and get to our rooms. Once we arrived, we went into the first room, which was on the first of two rooms on the first floor. They were supposedly non-smoking, but once we got in, it reaked of cigarette smoke. The senond of the two rooms wasn't as smoky but was very moldy smelling and musty. We called the front desk and asked for two different rooms. They situated us with two rooms on the second floor. The first room was fine and smelled fine. The second was a little moldy smelling, but not too terrible. The bathroom doors stick and my ten-year-old son got trapped inside. Some lightbulbs are burnt out and you cannot buy movies or play games on the televisions. There was a dead junebug under the bed. Frankly, I don't see what all the hoopla was all about.
