Excellent location by the Bund and a short walk from the pedestrianised shopping area. Powerful air con units in rooms and shower not bad either. Admittedly the decor is a little dated but for the price I thought it was excellent. Shanghai does boast a lot of luxury hotels and while this isn't one of them, it provides a good base for a short stay.
