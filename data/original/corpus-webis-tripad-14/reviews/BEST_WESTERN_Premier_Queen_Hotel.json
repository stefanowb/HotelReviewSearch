Our room was ok, not much of a value, but you get what you pay for. Its a 15-20 minute walk into town, but very close to the train station. Our complaint was the noise. A party started at about 8pm. A big charity event, with band, DJ etc. It started about 8pm, and got louder and louder until I called the desk at 1245 am and was told the party would be over at 1am. We booked this room only the night before our arrival. They must have known there was a problem with putting anyone in this room. The windows were vibating. If we had paid for a party room, it would have been fine. But we were paying for a bedroom to sleep.", "title": "Elegant looking older Hotel.

One of the reasons for choosing this hotel was because I know a little about it's history, and it was visited by many well-to-do folk in the 19th Century. This is primarily because of it's location, which is excellent if you have travelled to Chester by train. The building actually has a walkway joining it to the train station, it is that close. We arrived by car however and elected to park in the station carpark rather than the more expensive hotel carpark (which the receptionist actually advised us to do, very helpful!) One downside to this hotel is the cost, as it is rather steep in price I feel for what you get in a room, and I say that after we booked it cheaper through Booking.com! As for proximity to the centre of Chester, this hotel is not ideal and we had to drive to the centre each time. I am sure there will be a bus service however as people will need to get to the train station.", "title": "Overpriced and Dirty", "user": "W0rldtraveller10", "date": "September 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 42376037}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Overall, I have to say our experience at this hotel was thoroughly pleasant and I am very happy to have stayed there.", "title": "Should have been called the Dump Hotel!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mummychan", "date": "September 16, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 42162536}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed at the Queen Hotel for two nights with friends from Bath for a wedding. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so special and had a truly great stay from start to finish. The doorman was there to help us with our luggage, reception staff were so friendly - so unusual in this day and age. My room was in the old part of the building but had everything I needed and was clean and comfortable. I went to see one of my friends rooms in the Kings building and that was out of this world - well jealous! The wedding reception itself was the best I've ever been to (and I've been to loads). The food and service were great. Simon, the head waiter, in charge of the wedding was so profesional and friendly. He couldn't do enough for everyone. The party went on late but the staff were friendly til we went to bed at about 4am. We dragged ourselves out of bed just in time for breakfast which is the best hotel breakfast I've had with loads of choice and a glass of fizz. On Sunday there was a jazz band. The hotel has lovely gardens which was unexpected for a city centre hotel. The only slight downside is the charge for parking but I didn't mind too much as everything else was great.
