Had nothing to do with the weather. I expected it to be rainy in October. Luckily it only rained all day one day. I think for the amount of money I paid, I expected better service, food and my room was just okay (the bathroom toilet, the seat cover was almost broken off). Unfortunately, if you're looking for a quiet retreat, this place is not for you. It was extremely laid back. Also, there was a lot of construction and repair work going on that kind of cut into the sounds of the surroundings. I felt like I was annoying the manager if I tried to ask her questions. It seemed like she had more time to talk to her friends than with her guests. The food was substantial, and you'd never go hungry, but it was a bit on the salty side for my tastes. It wasn't all disappointing though. Other members of the staff were awesome and extremely friendly and warm. I went snorkeling off of Cano Island (successfully this time) and enjoyed it immensely. Our snorkeling guide, Sandra was great. The view from my room was beautiful and it was cool waking up to the sounds of the Pacific ocean and the chattering birds and geckos (before the sounds of the construction work got started). So, if you're considering Aguila de Osa, it's probably best not to go in October. If you're looking for a laid back, no hands on kind of place, this is the place for you.

As for the rooms, we enjoyed many long hours on our veranda birdwatching and soaking up the spectacular ocean view. We also had a great time kayaking, hiking, and birding the area. Since we were there mainly to bird, we didn't do any diving or fishing, so we can't comment on those. But the resident bird guide (Carlos), who took us on a number of very productive birding trips, and on the mangrove tour, was passionate and top notch. Also, the owner of the lodge, Bradd, is a laid back guy who takes very good care of his guests. He was always around to chat with during the evening cocktail hour, and cooked up a seriously good lentil soup for a few of us vegetarians. Yep, even the owner jumps into the kitchen now and then at Aguila! In fact, all of the food was excellent (including the meat and fish dishes according the carnivores in our party!). Finally, Bradd and his lodge are highly active in regional conservation projects (including Corcovado) and in local education programs.

We found the area and lodge very charming. Long walk up hill to rooms that overlook the beautiful bay and ocean. Rooms are basic but roomy with screen windows and ceiling fans that provide some respite to a very hot, muggy climate with little breeze. (A swimming pool would have been nice) We were in rooms 6 & 7 and had problems with erratic hot water which I heard is an ongoing problem. Not that I minded a cold shower but it's the principle when you're paying fairly steep prices. Meals were very good, served family style which provided a great opportunity to meet people from around the world and share stories. The hike into the Corcovado Rain Forest was good although challenging (slippery) to the waterfall. In addition to hiking boots try to bring a pair of water shoes to change into as you get closer to the fall. The animal viewing was just OK at Corcovado. Nature is so hit and miss. People the day before saw the sloths but we never saw them. Saw monkeys at the inn and also along the river while kayaking, which is a must-do activity. The trip to Cano Island on day 2 was great. The snorkeling was very good and my husband and son had 2 great dives. For the Pacific Ocean they thought the visibility was quite good and saw mantas, turtles, sharks and loads of fish. I was fascinated by the millions of hermit crabs on the shore of the island. Yes, the boats do come with the tourists mid-morning but it's not out of control and there were quieter areas to relax in. After Drake BAy we continued on to Manuel Antonio and to Arenal which was great but our favorite place was Drake Bay and Aquila because of the quaint and unique experience.
