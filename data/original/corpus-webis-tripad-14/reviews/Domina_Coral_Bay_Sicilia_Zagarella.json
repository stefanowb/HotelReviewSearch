The hotel is very nicely decorated. The only downfall to the decor is the glass door for the bathroom.

The buffet \"special dinner\" was not that great. The worst for me is that we had a late check in - after 9 p.m. and the front desk told us about the dinner. We arrived because the front desk told us that it was still available - we didn't even ask about it -and the waitstaff had to scramble to pull out a table for us and then the food was not replenished and we were left unsatisfied and still hungry. The breakfast was great and sufficient. I would stay here again and not participate in the special dinner especially because there is a restaurant right near the hotel that is reasonably priced and quiet good. The pools are great as are the bathrooms outside. The staff will want you to put all purchases on your room which was annoying one time because I didn't want to. We traveled by car to Palermo, Mt.
