We were in one of the Newport rooms in the new part of the inn. Lovely room, if somewhat small. Inn has lots of pleasant common spaces with comfy chairs and fireplaces for reading, chatting, enjoying the wonderful afternoon tea. Breakfast and afternoon tea were delicious. The drawback was that we weren't hungry enough for dinner one night! Will and Anne Marie are great hosts; friendly and helpful and obviously enjoying it. Every staff member we met was the same. The inn is within walking distance of all the downtown Newport attractions, and a short drive from the mansions and Cliff Walk. I won't stay anywhere else in Newport from now on.", "title": "Delightful, friendly staff pampered us ...", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "cliff2smith", "date": "April 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4895838}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006", "text": "Having been to a lot of inns over the years, we thought this one was lovely. We were in a Gardenside room which was even prettier in person than in the website photos. The bed was wonderful, the bathroom was small but really pretty, there was a fireplace (they provide duralogs), and a tv with vcr. Our only complaint was that it was very noisy the first night we were there (a Friday). The noise of all of the people on the street around 11 or midnight was enough to wake and keep me and my husband up for quite a while. We assumed that they were coming out of bars. There was bad weather the next night, so it was much quieter. I would imagine during the summer it would be very noisy.", "title": "Very nice inn", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "bostontraveler47", "date": "March 8, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4594185}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2002", "text": "The staff were very nice and took the time to give us a map and make suggestions of things to do, places to eat etc. The breakfast was very yummy with a choice of 2 entrees each morning. We did notice that because the tables are set up for 4 and not 2, that people seemed to be there at the stroke of the time that breakfast started (us included). We think this was probably because most of the couples didn't really want to sit with other couples. There is also a larger dining table in another room. There was an extensive and impressive tea each afternoon with treats galore. We kind of ruined our dinner by enjoying tea so much one day!!

Not only was the inn beautiful, the service was incredible. The breakfast and afternoon tea were always delicious and the rooms are large and comfortable, some with fireplaces.
