I have to agree with a lot of the positives that have been written about this resort and I'm sure that if you come in November when all the construction is over (or so Zoetry promises!) that everything will be wonderful. Our problem was that we chose to visit the place during their off season - the resort was only 1/3 full - and they were capitalizing on the low capacity to get a lot of their maintenance done. The major additions - basically doubling capacity - really didn't affect us at all. This portion of the construction is separated from most of the resort and the impact of it, as has been described by others, was minimal. However, the thatching (cana) that is basically the roof of every building needs to be replaced about every 8 years and it's being replaced on many of the buildings right now. As a result of this, the Indigo restaurant was being entirely gutted and was closed for the entire week we were there; also necessitating the closure of the (adjacent) main pool for three consecutive days because of falling debris. The same work was also being done on the coffee bar; internet cafe and boutique keeping them closed for the week as well. These three shops will probably be completed as I write this and the Indigo Restaurant work was moving quickly - my estimate was that it would be completed by the first week in October (2013). The bottom line on all this from a review standpoint is that it probably won't affect YOU as a future guest at all. But I do think the caveat is that while off season prices may be lower and rooms may be more available, resorts use the time (understandably!) to do their heavy maintenance when there's fewer guests. Problem is, it makes for a less inviting stay. We were placed right next to the construction - supposedly an upgrade, but the workmen were very noisy starting at about 7 AM. Add to this fact the problem that only one of the two other restaurants was open each night made our dining choices very limited. Incidentally, of the two restaurants only Amaya has AC. Olena therefore can be very uncomfortably warm at this time of year and when you have no alternative choice of restaurant...well, we sweated a lot every second night!", "title": "Maybe Not In The Off-Season!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CelticMutt", "date": "September 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 178454177}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013", "text": "OK; enough about the \"unfixables\"!

When we arrived at the property, you will notice it is a small property. However, they are in the process of adding on an additional 50 suites which we were told are bigger rooms (which is crazy as our room was quite large enough just for the two of us) I may be mistaken, however I think that they said there was even going to be another pool in that area as well. The fact that it is such a small resort and the amount of limited rooms, made us feel as if we were the only ones on the property at times, which we absolutely loved.

The croissants in the bread basket in the morning were absolutely delicious! For lunch (we had our's served on the beach everyday) the shrimp ceviche is to die for as well as the plantain soup (ordered it everyday) The grilled lobsters at dinner were delicious and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the fried salami at breakfast. We also enjoyed having a cappuccino everyday in the afternoon at the cafe and the cookies there were superb (however, the cappuccino was more of a latte). For cocktails, my favorite was the Tropical Zoetry which was a rum and passion fruit concoction.

We booked an Agua Suite and absolutely loved it. We were in room 16 and it was the closest Agua suite to not only the beach, but the larger pool and Indigo restaurant (where breakfast is served) I also highly recommend bringing a blow up raft so use in the serpentine pool.
