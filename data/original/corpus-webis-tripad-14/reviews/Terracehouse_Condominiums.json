This is the second time we have booked at the Terracehouse and I feel that units vary between modest/basic to very updated and upgraded. We were lucky this time and ended up at a third floor unit completely renovated with granite throughout and great furniture and decor pieces, as well as washer/ dryer in unit (the previous year our unit did not have one). My children (boys ages 5,6) loved the rustic bunk bed in their room. At first we were a little put off for being on the third floor and having to lug baggage, ski equipment, grocery bags... but, the high vaulted ceilings and beautiful views of the slopes certainly outweighed the inconvenience of walking up and down the stairs. After the first couple of days we even welcomed the exercise and it became our \"warm up\"session before hitting the slopes : )", "title": "Excellent Condo", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Carolina A", "date": "January 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122659644}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We didn't exactly experience ski in/ski out conditions due to the lower than average snowfall (meaning no snow at all on the floor) but the walk was very easy and even the little ones didn't complain about taking their own skis to the slopes.", "title": "Nothing Spectacular", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "stcharles11", "date": "July 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 115095297}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The Terracehouse hot tub is very large and cute with stones and little waterfalls.
