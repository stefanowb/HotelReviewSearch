The first two nights we were very happy with the accommodations. The room, though old, was comfortable. We liked the convenient location within the old town limits, close to many outdoor cafes and attractions of the city and within a 20 minute walk to the train station. We decided to spend a third night there as they had a room available although it required that we change rooms. The new room was uncomfortably hot even though it was supposed to be air conditioned. When we went to the desk to ask about the air conditioning we were scolded by the desk clerk who was on duty. She told us it was our fault for opening the window which caused the air conditioner not to work!!! Someone went up while we were out to dinner and attempted to fix the air conditioner but it really just didn't work well enough to cool the room. The first two days we were there a different woman was on duty at the desk and she couldn't have been nicer. The third day a new woman was there and she was very unpleasant. Besides the air conditioner incident she also refused to check us out that evening as we were leaving on a very early train and would be leaving before a clerk was on duty!!!!", "title": "Interesting and convenient", "user": "laglick", "date": "July 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 73176324}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled solo", "text": "That said the hotel is very interesting with a Roman ruin beneath it which you can see through a glass plate in the floor.

We were not disappointed with our choice although we were given a free room upgrade (not sure why) and so that may make us a bit biased. We did not take breakfast in the hotel as it was pricey and a 30 second stroll from the front door of the hotel takes you to Place Du Forum where you can buy the same thing for half the price. Driving and parking in Arles is a nightmare and if you have anything bigger than a Smart car you could find it rather stressful navigating the one-way system of cobbled alley ways. There is parking at the hotel and prices per day vary on the size of your car (from approx 12 to 14 euros). As we had a hire car we decided not to use the car park and abandoned the car just on the outskirts of the old town in a free space for three days. The Front Desk advised that our car would be quite safe and she was right. The swimming pool is fairly small and there is only room for about eight sun loungers so I can imagine it could get quite congested in high season. We were fine and shared the pool and deck with only two of three others on an afternoon post sightseeing. The salon, bar and restaurant areas are gorgeous and rather plush for a three start hotel. The bedrooms are quirky (as you would expect in a building of this age) but our bathroom was a bit tired and could do with being replaced. On one day our room had not been made up and so at 6pm we queried this with the Front Desk. They apologised profusely advising that the cleaning staff were new and rectified immediately. They also provided us with free drinks in the bar whilst we waited.
