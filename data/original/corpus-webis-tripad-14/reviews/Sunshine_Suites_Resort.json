It was our first trip to Grand Cayman Island and we loved this hotel!! The only downside is that it is a bit of a hike to the beach, which became annoying in the blazing heat while we carried a cooler, chairs, beachbag, snorkel gear, etc. But other than that, the hotel was the best we've ever stayed at. Grand Cayman Island is a VERY expensive island, and the free breakfasts, plus the $250 credit we received toward meals at the Sunshine Grill really helped us maintain our budget and feel like we got amazing value for our money. It ended up that we really only needed to pay for one meal per day (which we cooked in our room)! The staff was so genuine and friendly, like they really wanted to help in any way they could or with any questions we had. We were always greeted with a smile and professionalism. We've traveled to several Caribbean islands and been to many hotels, and we have never had better service. The pool is pretty small so I wouldn't recommend this hotel for pool people. The room and grounds were immaculate. The free breakfast was delicious; anyone who complains about it is probably a very difficult person to please, in my opinion. Make sure you rent a car for a day and explore the island, and definitely take the jet ski tour to stingray city- best excursion ever!!", "title": "Amazing value for your money!", "user": "heathergreg", "date": "July 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115736499}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Great location and beautiful well maintained property!!

For an additional $5 there is a full buffet but we didn't try it. Also, breakfast doesn't start until 7am so Divers on an early start may have to miss or grab and go.

It doesn't offer the 'Beach Resort' experience like the Westin across the road, but if you want to travel on a budget the hotel with the kitchens etc and the lower rate than the beach hotels makes this an excellent choice. The restaurant is popular with locals which makes it difficult as a guest to get a table. I think it would be good for the menu to be available in the rooms and guests to order from the room, even if it is just for pick-up...delivery would be good. The pool is in the middle of the outdoor dining area, so not that private if you want to suntan or have a swim. For me the area that disappointed was the housekeeping. After 3 days of not having the shampoo etc. topped up I had to ask for it, the bathroom had a strong smell- as I was here for almost 2 weeks- I took the initiative and purchased air freshners at the grocery. They provide both decafe and regular coffee, the regular coffee which was used was not topped up everyday which meant i had to wait until 7 a.m. to get my coffee downstairs. One morning I left a cereal bowl in the sink when I went to work. I didn't expect house keeping to wash it, but it would be a good service, I think the hotel should look at including it in the housekeeping. Instead, my neatly organized stash of snacks etc. were moved on top of the stove and the draining board was put out to communicate 'Do it yourself'...which kind of annoyed me. The last area I think management needs to look at is the television service. It is great that the hotel provides two tv's for the suite.....however the quality of picture on both was below standard, as if the rabbit ears needed to be moved. I would stay here again, the pros outweigh the cons, however I felt I needed to mention them so that there could be some fine tuning with housekeeping. I see most reviewers give the complimentary breakfast a thumbs up, I however feel like it works for children who don't mind sugar cereals, white toast and choice of one daily fruit, I personally think they could do better. The $5 hot breakfast buffet is value for money and considering the continental is so disappointing, I imagine most people opt to spend the $5. I have always stayed at the Sunshine Suites however because of the above mentionned items i think I'll try the Mariott on my next visit.", "title": "Loved the hotel.. will be back again!!", "user": "panda60", "date": "June 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 113180986}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Our family (husband, wife and twin 13-year old boys) enjoyed a week's stay at Sunshine Suites Resort this past month (July 2013).

The Sunshine Grill was also very tasty and service was great! We tried a lot of different items on the menu and they were all delicious! We went to the grocery store to fill our fridge and cupboards with snacks/drinks which was a few blocks away. The morning breakfast was also very convenient and delicious. Beautiful property, convenient laundry facilities, short walk to 7 mile beach (you cross a busy road but most locals would stop for you), nice pool, etc. Went to the World Gym which has an agreement with Sunshine (3 miles away via bus $3 one way) 3 times during my stay and ran on the beach the other days. Tips: buy beach umbrella at Cost You Less. The beach area is not shady so be prepared to bring something to have relief from the sun if you need it. The hotel doesn't have umbrellas but they have nice chairs and towels they will let you use during your stay. A lot of the time we came back to the hotel wet from diving or from the beach - because the rooms don't have a balcony or chairs to set things on to dry outside I would suggest bringing a laundry line to hang over the tub area. We felt bad having so many things wet in our room but not having enough room or a place to hang the items. In talking with the Sunshine Suites I mentioned this and they actually said they had the laundry lines on order so maybe call before you go to see if they have them yet (if not, bring something - it will help you dry your things out). Our maid was great to always make sure we had what we needed. We would return for another visit for sure. What a beautiful place and the people on the Island are VERY friendly and helpful.

Most people do not give this hotel a poor rating . My ratings in their Trip advisers chart for sleep quality , rooms Etc. we're not that bad at all . I have a lot of positive things to say about this hotel . First of all if you've never been to the Cayman Islands and landed without a reservation this is without a doubt the best go to hotel call get a room any room for one night don't think about anything and you'll have a better Time than other options by far . It's really amazing what these people have done to this simple property the grounds are amazing the colors are interesting And everything is consistent every trip as far as the cleanliness of the grounds and the general look . The problem is person who set up the general look and Attitude of this hotel left years ago although they've kept his look consistent things with the staff are slowly changing . The person who manages the hotel is a good guy as you can tell by their reviews but things are changing slowly . I stay in their highest price rooms and I find them pleasant extremely clean and I swear they steam clean the loveseats often . Sometimes I ask for the same room and it's in top shape like I said but even a year later the same air-conditioner in the same room will be making a Unusual noise -like the year before. the lovely head maintenance man will come up and does the best he can . He's not in control of ordering parts so it's like living the same drama year after year . Ask for the head maintenance man if you have a problem , don't bother him as he really is a nice guy . I find some problems with some of the so-called maintenance people and some of the housecleaners. Don't get me wrong everything is very clean in the rooms. One thing to remember though is Cayman Islands used to be governed by Jamaica and their are strong family ties between the two islands. Someone from Jamaica of course bring their exact cultural ideas with them and their views of life with them so in a way it's kind of like visiting Jamaica in a small way. The good and the bad. Everyone's just ultimately trying to come to to some type of human understanding. This hotel keeps a year-to-year 24-hour strong watch over the safety of the hotel and their guests. The only concerns I ever have are when they have a fill in security guard which never bothers me and once in a while I'll get a small uneasiness about one or to of the staff it's probably just me. The pool Maintenance is exceptionally good . You will probably only notice problems with the breakfast after repetitive stays, or stays more than one or two days . The staff who work the breakfast have been the same for years and just not happy themselves and either had no or lost all respect for tourists. God bless them I hope things work out. I find the food for dinner to be excellent and consistent and they'll even give you half portions if you ask can be lots of fun. In general something about the grill just seems to be slowly fading as well. I Asked for a dark and stormy at the bar which I don't usually frequent and was given the wrong type of rum And a cheap ginger ale . The \"cheap\" ginger ale is understandable due to the customs cost of importing items. This drink is made with the same type of rum worldwide it Requires this rum to be called a dark and stormy.)(I sat there for 15 minutes waiting for the bartender to serve other people was really patient wondering what was wrong with my drink. I saw the drink Poured and in my best Sunday school manners asked what was wrong and could I have another drink. Was told they were out of that type of rum hey no problem at all , I just want to have fun and relax. It's the response I got that was the problem that made the fun Goaway was given another Type of drink with very little Alcohol poured in it . I was given an attitude and a weak second drink how dare I ask for what I ordered ? They just never think they're going to see you again. I get this attitude a lot on Grand Cayman they are convinced they never going to see you again and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy I ask you even though I love Grand Cayman and will always go back the rest of my life what I'm I supposed to do. Buy a condo only go to the grocery store and hide the rest of my life. On the subject remember this is a hotel that changes their price every 15 minutes and also adds on electricity charges that other hotels do not add on to. Your bill. They also use gimmicks on the web to try to get you to sign up sign up for more rooms upgrades I don't know why ,I don't know why they do this because they are obviously highly rated. It's a weird combination of making a building that could be nothing into something spectacular having excellent grounds fun colors in a fun atmosphere but even from the top down some of the basic planning does not have loyalty to the customer in mind -even though this is a privately owned hotel . Many hotels Say they are almost full or half full and they are not even close to that. This hotel has more cars in the parking lot every time I drive by it compared to other hotels by far. So unless they're giving away rooms to friends or business partners they are definitely are doing something right compared to other hotels on the island . This review is half written for the sunshine suites and grill themselves in the hope that they can make a change like was made years ago to set up the original basis for the success of this hotel. There is a beach like no other within a short walking distance there's never any waves at the beach the water is the same 86 Degrees Fahrenheit all the time there is no crime on the beach The weather is incredibly consistent . even if the weather calls for rain just don't worry just go swimming - go down to the beach . Go try and take part in the local community but if you see some locals who look like people you wouldn't hang out with at home (Bad attitude ) drinking at the beach or are alcoholics it's best to stay away and deal with the other 95%to 98% ? of the population. I hope I have not been to wordy or straightforward about my review I'm only just trying to help best of luck . If by some chance you can tell who I am by this review once again I'm just trying to help I can see the writing on the wall Grand Cayman is going to get very busy especially your part of the island soon so I hope this helps. I just want to see everybody progress. I hope your staff and your hotel makes money and your staff is happy .", "title": "First time visitors, business travelers, high IQ people .
