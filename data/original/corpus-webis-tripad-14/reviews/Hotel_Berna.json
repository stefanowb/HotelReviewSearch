The staff, for the most part, were friendly and helpful. There were, however, a few things that spoiled it for me. The first was my arrival. The receptionist was dealing with a customer, which was fair enough, but I would have expected a smile and nod from him to acknowledge my existence. His attitude when he did get around to serving me was coolly polite, but certainly not welcoming. I was not shown to my room as I had been in other hotels of the same class in Europe, and the room was very hard to find, with the numbering confusing. The room itself was adequete, although the bathroom was truly minute, even for Europe. The worst part was the noise. I was closeted hard by two elevators, which clanked all night, and my room seemed to be the central juction for all the plumbing in the place. So my night was clank-clank, gurgle-gurgle, and i got hardly any sleep. I was advised by the desk that the hotel was fully booked. That may be so, but with a very long plane trip ahead of me next day, I could have done with some rest. They were apologetic, and looked after my bags next day until my afternoon departure, but wouldn't give me a late check-out so that I might have caught up on my sleep. They were too busy they said.

The staff was kind and helpful, almost eager to speak English, and they made it easy for me to check in early and they even upgraded my single room. The room was quite small but I was fully prepared for this, as all the information is clearly listed on the website. And really, it was perfect for what I needed -- a safe and clean homebase for a solo traveler more interested in exploring the city than spending time in the hotel. Clearly, the room had recently been redone (the interior of the room didn't quite jive with the more staid and expected reception area and hallways) but I was quite pleased by the small space. There were a large number of light switches that took a while to figure out (including some blue accent lighting for the bathroom). My window opened completely, the mini-fridge was stocked with free (non-alcoholic) items, and there were enough of electrical outlets. As far as perks go, I was particularly pleased with the towel warmers in the bathroom and the adorable rubber duckie that comes with a note encouraging you to take him home, complete with a quote that reads \"A day without laughter is a day wasted.\" Seriously, the space taken up by the bathroom was almost equivalent to the space for the bedroom. Shower only but there was a bidet, of course. Hallway/general hotel noise was minimal during the night and I slept well.
