We got a special internet rate, purchase three days in advance and save 20%. As others have said when we got there we asked for a complimentary upgrade to a suite and we got it and we had two rooms. The suite was large and roomy with a seperate bedroom. There were two televisions (ask for a second remote if you need it, room comes with one). There was a sofabed in the living room and a bunch of cabinets a microwave and fridge, no dishes of course. The breakfast over the weekend was cornedbeef hash, fake eggs and a variety of breads, biscuits and gravy, no waffles. On Monday there was sausage and bacon, it was overall very good. My favorite part was the pool even tho it was closed all weekend for roof repair on one end, we were able to still use it. The water was WARM, really superb. The jaccuzi was really hot and full of chlorine bewarned it will fade dark suits and tees etc. It was nice tho we didn't mind. All in all no complaints we always stay at HIE and this one didn't disappoint. The morning manager is really pleasant and can give better rates, the afternoon into the night manager speaks Chinese and is difficult to understand and be understood. Also the desk and chair was large and roomy and very comfortable to work on./ We also ate at the restaurant accross the street near the Days Inn and the food was great.(The Lighthouse) The prices went up since another user reviewed it the average meal is $16. food only. The hush puppies were great also the fried oysters and jumbo shrimp were our favorite( create your own). There is a karyoke room there and you hear the music, not bad just smokey if you want to go to the bathroom as you have to walk thru the karyoke/bar to the restroom.
