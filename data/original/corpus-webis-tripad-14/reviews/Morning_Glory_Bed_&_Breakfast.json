The suite also includes a cozy living room. The furnishings and decorations are no different than I would place in my own home (could I afford them). The expanded continental breakfast was much more than expected, with homemade breads, coffee cake, and granola, as well as a fresh fruit cup, fresh orange juice and delicious coffee. We had the pleasure of enjoying our breakfast with Bob (one of the proprietors) who was like an old friend and very informative on local history and attractions. I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to meet Marcel as I can imagine he is just as charming.
