The room we had was exactly as shown on the website and bathroom was nice and large. The rooms will always be small in Paris and as we spent most of our time exploring the bed was just perfect to come home to after the days acitivities. The metro is only just up or down the road however it is an easy walk to most tourist attractions. The local eateries also cater to the english speaking tourist quite well (helps to no a little french of course this is paris!!). My wife was also pleased to have some shopping alternatives close by with some chain stores and smaller boutiques all within 500m.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "tross30", "date": "June 7, 2007", "id": 7796831}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Paris"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 11, "average": 40, "very good": 192, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 352}, "aka": "Aviatic Hotel Paris", "slim_ranking": 0.0842163970998, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Situated between Saint Germain des Pres and Montparnasse, the Hotel Aviatic is a chic hotel in the centre of Paris. With nineteenth century furniture, cherry and chestnut tones on the walls, marble floors and a courtyard garden, the Aviatic captures the spirit of the Left Bank in every detail. The hotel was constructed in 1856 to welcome the painters, sculptors and writers who would go on to put the Latin quarter at the very heart of European culture. This cultural heritage is present even in the bedrooms. Tastefully decorated, they generate a feeling of calm and a sensual ambiance. The charming, multilingual staff are always available to provide you with help and advice. They will be happy to offer local insight on art galleries, museums and the area\u2019s famous pavement cafes."}
