The room we had was on the ground floor and wasn't massive, but it was lovely and had a great view of the back garden. One strange thing we noticed was that we could hear what sounded to us like a leak coming from the room above. We reported it and it was looked into, but nothing was found. However, we continued to hear the noise every night. It didn't overly bother us or keep us awake, it was just a little strange. It didn't appear from the reaction of the staff that this was something that had been reported before, so I'm sure it's all fine now. The hotel is a little walk from the Royal Mile etc, but it's a lovely walk particularly if you go via the Meadows. It's a very safe area and there are loads of brilliant places to eat nearby so there's no need to walk back into town if you don't want to. All in all we really liked this hotel and would stay again.

The shower head would not stay in position and would slowly 'bow' (tip down) during the shower. Front desk staff was informed.
