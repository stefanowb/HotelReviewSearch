However, every taxi driver we told the address had to look at a map or GPS to find it. When we entered late at night, I rang what I thought was the front door only to see the receptionist enter from a door of an internet cafe, which oddly enough was the lobby as well? They now have an elevator for those of you who were concerned, but the Hotel website is TERRIBLY misleading and makes you think every room is beautifully done. He first gave us a key and I was shocked when I opened the door. Cracked tiles in the bathroom, old, musty room with terrible decor. I immediately went downstairs thinking I was going to switch hotels. He reluctantly gave me the key to a 'newer' room after telling him that room was not what I payed for, and that I knew they had newer rooms than that. By the way, THE PLACE IS A CONSTRUCTION SITE! Ladders up, dust everywhere, construction noise all morning and day. Our breakfast was interrupted by hammers and drilling and then finally fire alarms set off from the construction.

We actually got engaged in our room there, and I still would never return to the hotel, which is very sad. To be fair, the location is great for visiting the Louvre, and we had no problems with the cleanliness, but other than that, there were no redeeming qualities. The room and bathroom were very small, and the actual surrounding area of the hotel is not nice. We had trouble sleeping due to the noise outside. There were no English stations on the TV (we visited three other European countries during our trip, and this was the only place without any English programs.). I could overlook those things, however, were it not for the unfriendliness of the staff. The lady on the front desk, in particular, was plain rude; if she had so much as given us a smile, I probably could have let everything else go. We politely asked for directions to somewhere to eat after we arrived, and she looked at us like we were asking her to give up her firstborn. We steered clear of the desk as much as we could for the rest of the trip, but had to talk to her to pay the bill, unfortunately. She wasn't able to get either of our credit cards to work, even though they were successfully used at every other place we visited in Europe (and other locations in Paris), before and after that hotel. We finally had to pay the bill in cash, which was very inconvenient. All in all, an unpleasant experience.
