The staff, from front desk (especially Jackie), to bellmen and concierge (all the guys: sorry if I forget anyone, Douglas, Daniel, Tracy). Like a ritz or 4 seasons, everybody went out of their way to learn our names and enhance our stay. We did find the rooms a bit small for the price, and switched out for a jr. Suite. They were very full during this time, so I Thank good old Dad for giving up his jr. Suite and taking our small double queen room. The rooms were clean and maid service good. The restaurant was good, and the staff- from manager to server, went out of their way to accommodate our demanding and partying group. God bless em all, especially the manager, whose name escapes me at the moment. I had the best lamb dish in quite awhile. Be warned, though: if you are in a hurry no restaurant on the river walk is fast. We waited quite awhile for our food at the 3 defers, river place, and mccormick down the walk a quarter mile. Both were very good, but slow to get the food out, and mccormick was very slow to seat us. We noticed they allow pets, and that there was never a wait for an elevator. The fruit infused water in the lobby was a nice touch, very refreshing. Last, the bed: gave me a sore lower back. I m not exactly sure why, but I noticed it after we switched to the jr.
