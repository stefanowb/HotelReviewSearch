We chose this hostel mainly due to the other positive reviews left and also there were a good selection of pictures. As it happens the pictures don't do it justice and the hostel exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a private room and it was spacious and clean as was the en suite shower room. The owner and staff were incredibly helpful and there was a daily notice board detailing trips and events - the City Tour was great and the Happy Hour (free Caipirinhas) should not be missed! A good selection of communal areas within the main hostel (it also has accommodation further along the street opposite its restaurant 'Bar Zulu') meant that people gathered together often by the pool, in the garden/patio area or in the lounge area and chatted and shared stories and helpful advice. The breakfast that is included is excellent and runs from 0800 to midday! The hostel dogs (Zulu a Brazilian Mastiff and Spartan the Boxer) deserve a mention as these were also one of our reasons for choosing to stay! Don't worry if you are not dog lovers as they will generally keep out of your way and there is space for everyone here! If you plan to visit Salvador this is THE place to stay!
