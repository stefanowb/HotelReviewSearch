I called the front desk, and the attendant was so nice, she had the bellman go up and grab them and I picked them up later that afternoon, before my flight back to San Diego. Upon my return I spoke with the valet/doorman who was helpful with lots of advice and info about downtown, the area and walking, and just in general. I was able to park and walk for awhile downtown.

Well he suggested \"Mothers\" which was about a 20 minute walk- not too bad distance wise, but when I asked him if some streets were safer/better/busier/prettier to go down then others he said it was all the same. I was in the lobby with 3 young children, so I thought he would\" get\" what I was asking for. So following his route we had to walk past several blocks with many transients/homeless and by some places advertising things that I did not want my kids to see. After I learned the downtown area I found there were many fantastic places about 5 to 8 minutes away if we went in the direction of the Pearl District or toward Nordstrum that I discovered on my own. Why he did not tell us about this area or direction, beats me. He lead us down a lonely area of the downtown to get to one breakfast house.
