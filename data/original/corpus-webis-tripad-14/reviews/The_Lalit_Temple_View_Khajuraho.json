In fact, it rivals the Taj Residency in Aurangabad for the worst hotel of our 2-week trip to India. The entire hotel was virtually deserted. We were the only people in the dining room each time we appeared for a meal. Food was very mediocre and they even charged us for bottled water at breakfast. No other hotel did that! The room was a typical motel-style accommodation. The pool was large and attractive but that did not make up for the hotel's deficits. This may be the best that Khajuraho offers but it is certainly not up to the standard we were expecting from the reviews.
