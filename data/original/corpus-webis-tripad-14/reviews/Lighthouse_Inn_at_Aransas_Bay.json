The moment we drove into Rockport, I could tell tell it was a very small yet \"big at heart\" kind of town. It was the perfect setting for our anniversary. We of course stayed at the Lighthouse Inn and it was everything that was to be expected. Right down to the soft bath robes! We had a suite with a kitchen, and for the money it was perfect. Since I am a chef (by profession) I was ready to cook the fresh catch my husband was going to bring in. Sad to report he only caught trout (good but I prefer red or flounders), which of the 50 or so he caught only 5 were keepers. With the guidence of the Fron Desk Clerk Dan (late night clerk) he had wonderful recomendations, and just for that we are deffinately comming back with our waders. Since it is Flounder Season the bays were perfect for floundering. Although this was our first time here, we will be prepaired the next time around. I have been to Corpus Christi, Port Aransas, and other sourrounding areas, and this has to be the best out of all of them. Rockport is said to be the cleanest coastal beach in Texas, and I believe it! Corpus, and Port Aransas is nothing (take my word!) compared to Rockport. The water was really clear to say the least, and pretty, I couldn't believe that we were in Texas! Back to the Hotel, I will try to post my pics.....so you can see that all the pictures that you have seen from other online websites are true to the \"T\"!!!!! It is very nice, the staff as another \"reviewer\" posted (rude), they are okay! Just let them know that they are being rude, and BOY THEY WILL DO A 360 on you! I do that with anyone that is rude to me..........I HATE RUDE PEOPLE TOO! Anyways, the rooms are small even the suites but it was just right. The lighted pier was beautiful, and adds a nice \"evening fishing touch\". My poor husband was so determined to catch \"A BIG ONE\" that it never came. Maybe next time!!! Please if you get a suite, get one over looking the BAY it is worth it, anything on the opposite side overlooks the pool or the parking lot, NOT GOOD IF YOU ARE SHELLING OUT THE DOUGH! They really do have Starbucks coffee and cups in the room, the pots and pans are decent, but if you plan to cook be sure to bring your own knifes and cooking utensils. It makes cooking more enjoyable, also maybe a bigger chopping board. The refridgerator is full size, and nice, they have an ice machine on the 2nd floor (nice!!!) as we like our drinks COLD!! The porch is very cute, they have two rocking chairs and a table for your morning coffee, or current magazine or book. There are two t.v's one in the master bedroom, and one with a D.V.D player and stereo in the living room, there is also a sofa bed in the living room. Nice for when you are watching a D.V.D. Since we travel a lot we carry DVDs all the time since we have t.v.s in our suburban. The stove is electric (I have yet to find a hotel w/ kitchens that have gas). The table is small but \"DO-able\". But overall the views from the 2nd floor are beautiful to say the least! We didn't have time to go to the bar downstairs, but there is one! The furniture is nice, as with everything that was in that hotel! I hope this helps you on your search for a hotel in the Rockport area. I've seen majority of the hotels there as we drove Fulton Beach Rd along the coast, and this hotel is the best one BY FAR!!!!! Oh yeah, if you want to eat somewhere nice in the area (me...I prefer cooking since I am a chef, and I Like to save money :)!!! I would highly recomend a nice little joint called the Java Bay Cafe for breakfast(nice breakfast buffet on the weekends) also I love Pinini's and for lunch they make good ones. The boiling pot is right across from the hotel, and it seems if they can sell a bucket of 6 beers for 20 bucks they are trying to reel you in, so be leery! We did eat at Alice Fays, and we didn't like it at all RUDE RUDE RUDE people, and very unfriendly, they quoted us one price and charged us another, and it was horrible!!! DO NOT GO TO ALICE FAYS! There is a brand new super walmart on 35 and it was perfect for getting those last minute things that you forgot! Have Fun and we are already planning our next trip!
