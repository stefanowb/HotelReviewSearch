Initially we tried to book an hotel in Colmar itself but everything we fancied was fully booked. Came across this one via Trip Advisor and we weren't disappointed. It's a new hotel so hasn't had the chance to get knocked about. The decor is very modern and a bit \"quirky\". Our room wasn't the biggest in the world and no view to speak of but perfectly adequate for us and our luggage. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet. Free WiFi worked great in the room. Parking was free too and plenty of it. I agree with some other reviewers that you need a car if you are going to stay here as it's too far out of town and we were quoted about 30Euros each way for a taxi, we took the car instead! The location is on a main road and next to retail outlets etc., very much like you find driving through America or where you find Premier Inns here in the UK, i.e. next to businesses etc. No problems communicating in English with Reception. Downside was the bar, as there was only 1 Receptionist who was trying to book in guests and service the bar at the same time and of course those booking in got priority. Breakfast buffet was good, although if you like \"real\" coffee you will be disappointed as theirs is out of one of those multi-choice machines. P.S. Don't miss the mini Statue Of Liberty on the main road near the hotel which is an exact smaller version of the \"Lady\" herself.", "title": "Great hotel good prices!", "user": "223Lee223", "date": "October 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 143102914}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled solo", "text": "We stayed at Roi Soleil for one night in September.
