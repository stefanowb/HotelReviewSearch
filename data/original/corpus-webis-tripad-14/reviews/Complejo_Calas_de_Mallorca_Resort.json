Me & my partner went here. To say the NICE things about the hotel are the sea views it offers, the food is alright, the service and the facilities (for children) and pools are nice. The beach is within walking distance and AMAZING. (Cala Domingos, cala antenas is known for jellyfish). We were happy when we arrived as everything seemed nice, but when we arrived to our room, it is in EXTREME NEED of renovation! The door was falling off the hinges, and it was a SAUNA when we walked into the room. I knew it had no air con, but figured (as the reviews said) the ceiling fan would help, well, it did NOT help and it made noises when you had it on, I couldnt sleep well and it looked like it would fall from the ceiling! As well, a hotel near by had LOUD and corny entertainment on every night outside until quite late, and it was impossible to sleep because of the loud noise. We ended up changing hotels. If they renovated this hotel and put air conditioning in the rooms and a TV, got rid of the outdoor entertainment from the other hotel, then YES we would go back, but ONLY then. This hotel is more suited to families with children, not young couples.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Chicita", "date": "July 31, 2006", "id": 5533660}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Visited the Hotel on July 4th and stayed for a week with my boyfriend.

The pools were really good but be careful on the shallow end of the large pool as the steps are loose, they were checked but classed as ok?
