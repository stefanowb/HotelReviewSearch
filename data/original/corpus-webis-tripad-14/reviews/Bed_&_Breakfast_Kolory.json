Lots to eat at breakfast and the staff were very friendly and helpful all the time. I would certainly reccommend this hotel. The rooms are decorated with wood carvings and naive paintings depicting country life. I see from one of the reviews that there was no shampoo, but I was not expecting any, or hairdryer. It is a bed and breakfast and not a large hotel. The atmosphere there is very relaxed and its easy to chat to other guests over breakfast. Lots of restaurants to choose from.
