Breakfast was fine - waffles, sausage, eggs, breads, muffins, bagels, cereals, juice, coffee. Evening snacks/drinks were really not needed given the city we were in and all the awesome dining options but I would think if you had kids with you and they were old enough to leave in the room for a few hours you would be thrilled with the oportunity to feed them chicken nuggets or hot dogs and then go out for a great meal. The drinks were either draft bud light or house wine/whiskey - 3 per person. Service was excellent all around - front desk, housekeeping and others. Rooftop jacuzzi was a nice addition.

We got a 2 room King Suite for the 3 of us. We loved everything about this room. The ceilings and windows are old-style tall...which just feels right in this city. There is lots of granite everywhere. The living room is a completely separate room so everyone had their privacy. The king bed was very comfortable.

The breakfast was a very nice buffet, hot, and plentiful with real scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, fruit, juice...and the evening cocktails/soda and wings, chips, baked potatoes, hotdogs, veggies, dips, & chicken fingers were plentiful and a great alternative to eating out again. We had a big lunch so just \"snack food\" was perfect allowing us time to enjoy the pool on the ROOF!! Parking is fenced, selfpark right next to the hotel for about $17. It is within easy walking distance of the famous \"Mother's\"...and all the traditional New Orleans favorites.
