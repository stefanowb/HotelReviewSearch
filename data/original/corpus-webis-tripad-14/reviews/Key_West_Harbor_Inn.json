We found the St John room was perfectly fine for two (but we like each other). If you need some space from your other, there is always a wrap-around porch steps from your door with plenty of seating or you could always just go float in the pool 24-7. The porch was great to listen to local music at night or the doves \"whoing\" in the morning. No coffee maker or refer in this room FYI - but plently of coffee/drink during morning and afternoon available anyway; another option only a block away (to the rear of property) is a great local coffee house/bakery; almost as close in the other direction is cuban coffee (and a really good cuban mix sandwich) and a liquor store with really big refer's to quench your thirst if you need an endless happy hour. The bath was spacious, big tiled shower, well lighted. Be forewarned if one of your carry-on's is totally cosmetics, you'll have a tough time in this bath (could maybe use a shelf) - we just hung our bath travel bag on the towel rack, it worked fine. Please leave the mascara home - this is an island, go naked (but please don't sit on Tracy's chairs....). Room was cleaned beautifully each day, towel animals and everything (the swans don't really float, but they make pretty nice pool towels). Good sized closet with safe, two bed-side tables with a drawer; we just kept all in luggage, besides, how much room do bathing suits and t-shirts take? Other guests were considerate (no loud voices or door slamming) and overall the inn was very quiet (still nicely socialble during morning/happy hour).
