Been meaning to write a review for months... I wanted to stay in Old San Juan so I could visit the museums and forts, as well view the beautiful architecture. I called the management about one of their apartment locations. They recommended that I stay at Da House so I decided to take a chance. Glad I did. The location was perfect for daily walks around the city, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the rooms as well as overall hotel were charming. I read a few reviews so initially, I booked a room away from the alley. But after seeing the rooms from the balcony, I switched the next day to a balcony room. The noise didn't bother me a bit (although I guess if you're a light sleeper it might). There wasn't an elevator, but the staff helped me with my bags upon arrival and departure and the walk upstairs wasn't like a skyscraper. The bathrooms were tight, but they were clean and the towels were fresh (something I'm a stickler about).

We were happy with both properties and would return. We especially loved the location of Da House. Old San Juan has so many great restaurants in the SoFo district which is literally a 5 minute walk from Da House (we recommend Aquaviva and Dragonfly for dinner or drinks). Also, for breakfast there is a great place right around the corner called Mallorca. There are also so many great art galleries close by and we just had such a great time walking around and being centrally located. There is also a great club downstairs called the Nuyorican Cafe that has live music and gives you a taste of the local flavor. The only bad thing is the noise, you will defintiely hear it at Da House.. If you aren't planning to be out late at night, this may be a reason to not stay here. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The decor in Da House is very cool, great artwork and cool furniture but the rooms are small; this is really just a place to stay and don't expect to spend too much time in your room. It is clean and nice but not romantic or luxurious. We also felt very safe at all times, they have great security. On the other hand, you may want to stay at their sister property La Caleta (which you can also book on their website). These are one bedroom apartments that are roomy and also in a great location (right next door to El Convento). The apartments are a little run down but they are roomy, afforable and you can cook some of your meals there and be comfortable. Both of these properties are probably not intended for any high-maintenance travellers that would be happier at a resort in Condado or Isla Verde.
