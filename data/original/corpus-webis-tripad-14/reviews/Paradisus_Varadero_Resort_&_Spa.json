I was there the same time as the previous reviewer. While the mosquitos were bad, the hotel was going around spraying 2x/day. Other people we met at other hotels also were having issues with the mosquitos. They are bad all over!!! Put some bug spray on and get over it!!! They never got into our room unless we left a door open. But the rest of the place was incredible. It felt like paradise!!! The rooms were great. The entertainment great and the staff was very friendly. The beach was gorgeous and we never had any issues finding a cabana to relax under all day. Bring your own insulated cups, they will make your drinks right in there for you. Tipping helped with some of the service but it wasnt required. My only complaint would be while the food tasted excellent, it was the same food every day. Lunch and dinner was the same. So it is best to go to the ala carte restaurants. Stick with the Romantique and Italian. But the alcohol was great and they werent conservative with the rum.
