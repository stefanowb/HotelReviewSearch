There is a sweeping staircase leading to the lower ground level, restaurant and pool area. We were allocated room 1074 which was a refurbished room but had two steps from the bath area down to the bedroom. These proved to be dangerous especially in the middle of the night. We requested a move which was sorted the next day. The hotel is quite worn in places but is kept very clean. The restaurant area is more akin to a busy cafeteria with the waiters struggling to clear off the tables at busy times which causes queueing. In the mornings it is common for there to be no cups. There are two drinks dispensing areas but some of the machines were never on during our stay which again caused queueing. The food and variety was generally good both in the restaurant and pool snack bar, if you be a bit adventuress you will be suprised at some of the dishes. There is a large free form pool with plenty of loungers, if youre not bothered about getting up in the morning to bag the best positions there is always somewhere to plonk yourself later on. There is a childrens pool with a galleon and water slide plus a play area. The evening entertainment was a mixture of the animation team and profesional artists and was quite enjoyable. We found all the staff at the hotel to be hard working and pleasant at all times. The hotel is in a very good position about 300 m down to the beach. A 15 minute walk to the Rubicon Marina, 20 minute walk to the port and 10 minute walk to the start of the main pedestrianised shopping area. Overall we would consider this hotel to be more of a 3 star, but would certainly return again. We thought the resort was very pleasant whith a nice mixture of bars and restaurants. We went to fuerteventura on the small ferry (20 euros each) but didnt think it was worth going.
