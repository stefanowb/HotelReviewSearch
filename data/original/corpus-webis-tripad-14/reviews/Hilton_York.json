The hotel is in a super location just in front of Clifford's Tower so fantastic for the three boys in our party (ages 10, 7 and 6) . The staff at the hotel were outstanding. The breakfast was great and the waiting staff at breakfast even noticed that we were celebrating the 10 year old's birthday. They prepared some lovely pancakes (with absolutely no request or prompting) and they had added a birthday message and 10 candles. They sang happy birthday with us and the 10 year old was really thrilled. What kind and thoughtful staff. The hotel should be proud! We had two double-double rooms. The rooms are absolutely fine. Nicely decorated and very clean. Not much space but you don't need it for a couple of nights. The only niggle we had was that that room was very hot and we could not turn down the heating.

The breakfast was a buffet breakfast as is often the case in hotels such as this. The buffet system was chaotic, again not unusual but not helped in this instance by a poor design of staff entrances to the kitchen areas which meant that guests in the queue constantly had to move out of the way of staff. The quality of food was poor. Even with a buffet breakfast there is no excuse for grey, congealed scrambled egg and fried eggs sitting in pools of fat. However, the breakfast was comparatively good compared to the one dinner which we had there on our first night. The meal was bland and poorly cooked using very poor quality ingredients. A game pie consisted of thick, overcooked pastry and a filling which was of a paste like consistency.
