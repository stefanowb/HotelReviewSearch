The staff were all very friendly and above all very helpful. The rooms are quaility and the beds very comfortable. We started a circular road trip from here that took us to Zion, Bryce Canyon and Arches National Parks and then back to Zion and it was great knowing that we were heading back to the Abbey Inn to end our trip. We made our bookings with the hotel whilst we were travelling and the staff were very helpful with our accomodation needs. Breakfast was also very good. The staff also helped with a great recommendation for where we could eat dinner, the Black Bear Diner that is only 100 metres down the road from the Hotel. What a combination! Definitely one of the best hotels that I have stayed in and to top it off it is a very reasonable cost for the accomodation.

The price is right for what you receive in return. The location is great, the building and accommodations are great, the free breakfast is great, and all the staff I met are great. I always enjoy using the 24-hour fitness center located near the lobby. And I have always been upgraded (if available) after asking the clerk at check in. I still think it is great to be able to read the complimentary USA Today newspaper available in the morning on weekdays. Okay, so hopefully by now you have figured out that this is a great place to stay! Having lodged at hundreds of Best Westerns across the United States, the Abbey Inn in St. George is the standard I use to compare all others. As I checked out, I wanted to commend upper management of the superior job that they were doing. I spoke with Jordan, who is the assistant general manager. I let him know that this Best Western Plus is just as good as the two Best Western Premier hotels that I have stayed at in the past. I was informed that the Best Western Plus Abbey Inn is run by a family (compared to a corporate entity), and they have made the choice not to serve alcohol at this location, which is one criterion for obtaining the \"Premier\" rating from Best Western International. You cannot fault anyone for standing by their values. For all the reasons stated above, I will be looking forward to residing here once again when in the St. George area.", "title": "The best Best Western!", "user": "MrLorin", "date": "January 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150317515}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel has great staff with a well kept pool and hot tub open all year round .The location is very easy to get in and out of very close to everything you may need !!

Bathroom was exactly like a master bath, huge tube, separate shower stall, toilet, granite and tile. Sink area was outside. Bathroom has two doors, one from sofabed fireplace area and another door by sink area, brilliant. Breakfast was exceptional, hot buffet style. Scrambled eggs, eggs with bacon, biscuits, gravy, hash browns, many juices, delicious jasmine green tea and many other teas, coffee, milk, fruits, waffles, cereals, oatmeal, yoghurt, breads, cottage cheese, and still more. Staff cleared tables and picked up finished plates promptly. Hotel was close to freeway but not noisy at all.
