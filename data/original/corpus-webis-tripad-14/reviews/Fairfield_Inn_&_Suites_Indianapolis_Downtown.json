Room we had MUST HAVE BEEN THE WORST LOCATED ROOM IN HOTEL...and all because I booked through Expedia??? Still paid $175 per night so to say the least I am not happy with the experience.

Let me first say that the location is excellent if you need to be close to the State House. Secondly, from the arrival in the parking garage to check-out this was hands down my favorite place to stay in Indy. The garage is very clearly marked so that you know which entrance to use for which hotel. EXCELLENT! Secondly, check in was smooth, quick and the gentleman at the desk was courteous, friendly, and knowledgeable. The hotel was immaculate from the moment you step off the elevator from the garage. The halls, elevators in the hotel, and especially the rooms were extremely clean and smelled clean! I hope this is an everyday event because I am staying there again next Thursday evening. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to someone looking for a NICE, CLEAN, FRIENDLY hotel. This is the first time I have written such a raving review because it was definitely worth it.

The breakfast they put out was perfect with waffles, oatmeal, breakfast sandwiches, bagels, cereal, etc. We also enjoyed the free wi-fi and the TGI Friday's that was attached.
