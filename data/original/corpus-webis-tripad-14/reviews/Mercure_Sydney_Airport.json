Had pre-booked for 6:30 pm on a Saturday night and the restaurant was about 3/4 full. Warning bells started when, for the first time in visiting thousands of restaurants we were told when shown to our seats, \"There'll be a wait before we can give you a menu to look at as there's not enough to go around\". (Really? Never heard of a photocopier??). Some 20 minutes later and the restaurant has dwindled to 50% full. We were given drinks ordered when we arrived. \"Would you like to order now?\". \"Well we would if we could see a menu\". Finally got one. (they must be made of gold and encrusted with diamonds they are so rare). Another 30 minutes. We were starving now having heavily debated every item on the scant listing. \"Have you decided yet?\". \"Yes - quite a while ago\". \"Has anyone explained the specials to you yet?\". \"No. You didn't when you gave us the menu. Would you like to now?\". \"Ok. There are no specials but there is no veal\". (Rather special as one of our party had decided that's all they wanted). \"OK - sorry you can't have the veal. But I highly recommend the chicken breast (pointing to it on the menu\". \"OK (a bit reluctant) - seeing you recommended it\". Over an hour later some of our meals arrived - several minutes apart. Ex- Veal now Chicken breast orderer - about 30 minutes later, gets a Caesar Salad (which they hate) plonked in front of them. \"Um, we didn't order that - we wanted the Chicken breast\". \"Oh - sorry for the mistake (takes dish away)\". Rest of the party finish their meals. We wait another half an hour. Still no chicken breast. Empty plates cleared (after sharing some with starving chicken breast orderer who was just about to pass out with starvation). \"How was your meal?\". \"Um. OK except one of our party still hasn't got theirs\". \"OK. I fix [sic]\". 5 minutes later a sorry excuse for a stewed Chicken Maryland - bones and all on top of under-done porridge consistency polenta arrives - inedible. We wait for service - trying to attract the attention of one of the 8 or so wait-staff who are experts in avoiding eye-contact and apparently very hard of hearing. We stupidly hope at least for some dessert and coffee. We look over to the sad face of another lady at a nearby table who arrived shortly after we did. She berates her partner: \"Still haven't seen the menu!\". We give up, nearly 3 hours after first being seated. Still hungry as we set off for the nearest take-way to fuel up for the long travelling day ahead. What a grand way to start an international holiday! (Never, ever again....).
