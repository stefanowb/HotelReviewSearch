It is a half day trip. We found Dawn Beach to be pleasant as well as Orient Beach, do not miss. As far as location, we did not mind being away from the main cities, we had a car.

We had lunch while waiting for some jewelry to be resized that we purchased on Front St. My only complaint is that we went during the off season (late August to early October) and the majority of French shops and restaurants in Marigot and Grand Case were closed. We didn't even bother going over to St. Barth's as we heard it would be much of the same. These towns were virtually abandoned while we were there. But the positive is that traffic was light except for a couple of intersections, both on the Dutch side. On the main road which is a 3 way yield, not stop, yield (which means a free for all) which leads to Phillipsburg, Marigot or Simpson Bay, this was always backed up. And the worst intersection was coming out of Phillipsburg toward Cole Bay Hill and the marging traffic from the Middle Region before the traffic circle, awful. However, at this traffic circle you will find the best market (like any supermarket in the US) and I don't remember the name, but it is next to Mark's Place, which we also dined at and recommend. You will find many locals here. Our other favorite was a casual place in Simpson Bay called Pineapple Petes, great food and service, reasonable price. Overall, a good hotel, probably upper 3 1/2 stars in the US. The pool area and exterior walls could use a power washing and some fresh paint, but if that is my only complaint then that is not bad. Also go to Beau Beau's all you can eat BBQ night, good ribs and great chicken.

We were guests of family members that are owners. This resort was in an ideal tucked away location. The check in process was without hassel. The grounds to the resort are immaculate and you can see the effort put in by the staff to keep it that way. Our accomdations far exceed our expecatations. We had a one bedroom suite that had every amenity of home. The housekeeping staff kept the place immuclate and there were fresh towels every day. One day we returned from our outing and there were fresh placemat rugs in the bathroom and bedroom. Upon our arrival we attended a Welcome Orientation that basically gave you a schedule of activities and things to do on the island which was very helpful. The resort was surrounded by the beautiful water. The front side had a spectacular marina view of many sailboats. Laundry facility, exercise room, gift shop, all on hand. There was a small grocery store with items and a nice restuaurant called Big Fish that we ate at for breakfast the food delicious and very reasonable. The staff so friendly. The resort was very accomodating the poolside the best. The spectular view of the infinity pool just kept you going back everyday. The staff there waited on you had and foot. The bartenders at Infinity were so friendly. This resort is the type of place you have to pull yourself from daily to go out and explore because of how relaxed the atomosphere is you just could hang out at the pool or beach all day. We did rent a car and explored the Island at our own pace. We did a grocery store shop on the island tour. This was helpful, as we had full kitchen amenities, and was able to make some of our own meals. There was entertainment and the activites staff kept you occupied if you wanted to do so. We ate mostly at the Beau Beau's restaurant the food was good. We attended the 3 island snorkel trip and it was our first time.

We used his parents timeshare exchange and a getaway for a two week trip. Two weeks was great for me, but I could sit on a lounge chair and read a book forever. If you are a busy body and can't sit still for two weeks, only go for one. The hotel staff was great. The reception was a bit cold, not rude, just not overly friendly when we checked in, but there were no problems. They had our information and someone brought our luggage to the room. The first week we stayed in a studio with a kitchenette and ate breakfast in the room. We ate at Beau Beau's alot during week one and enjoyed it. Everyone was nice there and got to know us by name, which was fun. Get the Lobster Thermador (if they have it, we only got it one night because their lobster selection isn't always available). We ate at the Infinity restaurant one night and was not overly impressed. Nothing bad, just not great. The Infinity bar, however, was great. The barstaff there was awesome! Casper is the best bartender and is so much fun. We spent a majority of our days laying by the pool and getting lunch and drinks from the bar. Nothing fancy, just bar food. We went to Captain Oliver's two nights. I loved it, but my husband got sick from it both times we went. I guess it depends on if you have a sensative stomach. They have a bus that comes and gets you and drops you off. We ate at Mr. Busby's down the road a couple days and it was ok. The only truly positive thing about that place is the $.75 carib beers they have. The food was ok, but the service was not consistent at all, borderlining on horrible. But it's cheap enough for lunch and VERY cheap beers. We did not rent a car and did not have a problem. The activity desk will call you a cab wherever you want to go and the hop on hop off bus was great for us. Some people complained that there wasn't enough options, but for us it was fine. We did the three island snorkel with captain alan and coleen, it is a must! Not only is it a fun morning, but they take you to an island and you get a mud bath. Good times. We did the 12 Meter Regatta which was another must do. So much fun! Orient Beach is great, lots of naked people, but fun. Foods expensive on the french side and everything has a 15% tax. We kept our dining to the Dutch side because we did not want to pay 30% on top of dinner (15 for tax and 15 for tip). The second week we upgraded to a one bedroom and that was great. Full kitchen and very large bathroom. We went grocery shopping once via the hop on hop off bus and had no problem. Make sure you go to the grocery store because the Mom and Pop's store is expensive and they hardly EVER had change so everything was rounded, not a big deal but $.70 a day is annoying.

The beach area was quite small and there was a lot of seaweed on the beach and floating around. Needless to say we found other beaches the rest of the week. We booked two excursions through the resort. Monday was Carnival and the resort had buses for us to attend. It was quite an experience. We also went on a snorkling trip to Anguilla. Well worth it. Captain Arthur and his crew were very hospitable and entertaining. The first night we ate at Daniel's which was right outside the resort. Service was terrible and the food was very average. We did not eat in the area again. OBBR has a two for one happy hour from 4-6 and the bartenders were very nice. Overall I was impressed with the staff.

It has a great view of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy (St. Barts), which cuts a dramatic profile on the nearby horizon. This area is not very good for snorkeling, unless maybe you're up for a very long swim out to the true reef. During our stay, this entire side of the island (eastern side) was more prone to wind and waves than some other areas, but the outer reef catches most of that energy so the waves at the beach were quite small. We visited a lot of other beaches on the island - some just to look, not to swim. Among the most beautiful, I thought, were Baie Rouge and Baie aux Prunes.

However like with all resort there are a few that aren't very good at customer service and not helpful and only offer information when asked specifically. We traveled with our 15 mo old daughter and when we arrived they checked us in right away. The crib and high chair I requested was already there which was kudos for their coordination as when I called ahead they even took down my flight information. There were daily cleaning service and the resort doesn't nickel and dime you by providing free wi-if in common area, providing paper towels, dishing washing liquid in the room and providing beach chair and umbrella at the beach. The cons were that there is smoking allowed at the property so there are cigarettes butts everywhere and people constantly smoking around you. Which as a non-smoker and with a young toddler it's very unpleasant. The sand at the beach is the finest we have seen of the many beaches we have been to around the world but is littered with cigarette butts makes it unsightly. Many resorts we stay at have designated smoking areas. The rooms were a bit dated but sufficient with all condo amenities. The information packet provided in the rooms weren't really detailed/helpful. There is no in-room dining available so you have to pick up. The restaurant food was average. The walls are thin and you can hear your neighbor coming home each night or when they are watching a tv show.

Oyster Bay had ALOT of entertainment going on & we met & had fun with people all over the world! I have never seen a place where also the guests know each other because they come every year & I see why! I can't say enough about this place! Also, If you go...
