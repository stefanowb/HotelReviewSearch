For disabled access this hotel is great as there are ramps everywhere which we were unaware of at the time of booking so it was a real plus. The island does however, have good disabled access in the town centres especially Play del Ingles only 10 mins walk away from the centre and 5 mins in a cab which should cost between 3-4 Euros.
