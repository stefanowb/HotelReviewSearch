Firstly on ordering the famous doubletree cookies everybody mentions in their reviews, the hotel told us they would be unable to provide us with them until the day after (although they have a card in the room saying cookies can be made within 30 minutes). A few cosmetic problems with the room started to prove a problem: the window wouldn't completely shut so we could hear the traffic at night, the sealant started to come off the bath so damp started forming under the floor causing a smell, additionally some of the lighting was broken (but was not repaired after informing them). On ordering cocktails at the swimming pool, there was a 30 minute delay whilst the lady phoned a colleague for the recipe - the drink came and my pale pink 7 JD (7 USD, 6 Euro) Singapore Sling tasted like water. If there is a cocktail menu, staff should be trained in making cocktails! The dinner buffet was almost in the pitch dark and at 26 JD was poor value and a poor selection compared to the equivalently priced Movenpick buffet in Aqaba round the corner. Additionally each time \"careline\", was called, we noticed none of the problems ending up being fixed or resolved. At one point we requested their in-house doctor (available according to the booklet in the room). The first time we phoned careline they didn't understand what we wanted and told us they would send an \"engineer\" up. On speaking to the customer service manager, we found the doctor was not in fact on site at all and could only be brought on site for 75 US dollars. Doubletree ought to ensure the information provided to the customer is correct. A final complaint was the diabolically slow internet speeds (that were charged as a daily extra): so slow even google took several seconds to load.", "title": "Lovely hotel", "user": "TomTrundle", "date": "October 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119035410}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very friendly hotel, spotless and with great food", "text": "The customer service manager did phone during the stay to check \"everything was 100%\" and on telling her the cookie problem offered to send some up to the room.

Our first impressions of the property were fantastic. My husband is a HiltonHonors Diamond member and the management really rolled out the red carpets for us. We were greeted by all of the managers of the hotel, upgraded to a lovely room, and sent fruit, cookies and tea as a welcome. The room was very large and well appointed. There were various construction issues (shower door didn't close all the way, robe hook was loose, mini bar fridge was not cold) but nothing major that disrupted our stay. The bed was extremely comfortable and provided a great night's rest. The staff at the breakfast buffet is extremely attentive, but almost to the point of being bothersome. They were constantly asking if we needed anything else, but after 3 or 4 times, it got a little old. I understand that they are trying to receive top marks in customer service but they need additional training on not crossing the line between attentiveness and being nuisances. The buffet itself was delicious and there was plenty on offer. I think it was overpriced, however. I agree with others' comments that the hotel staff seems a little disorganized. At the lounge, we ordered a beer but they were out, same thing happened at the pool. When we phoned the Careline about snorkeling and laundry, they seemed a bit confused. When we checked out the first time (since we were leaving for Petra) they charged us for our breakfast buffets even though we were told they were complimentary. My husband travels nearly every day for work and stays almost exclusively with Hilton properties and had to educate the staff that Diamond members are entitled to a free breakfast, while the staff was saying we are entitled to either a free breakfast or an upgrade, but not both. As I mentioned, we departed for Petra then returned back to the Doubletree. We stored our luggage with the hotel and had no problems with it whatsoever. When we checked back in after our visit to Petra, the manager informed us that he had misunderstood the policy and that the Diamond member gets both the upgrade and the breakfast and apologized for the prior confusion. We ate at the restaurant for dinner and found it to be delicious, although it was a little expensive relative to what you would pay around town. We really enjoyed the fact that the chef was experimenting with various appetizers and brought a tray around for us to sample and comment on. It was kind of fun. While staying the second time around, we helped ourselves to the peanuts and wine split and were charged upon checkout. We also had them the first stay but weren't charged at check out. We honestly thought they were free and not part of the mini bar since they weren't in the mini bar and didn't have a price list next to them, so that was confusing. We swam at the pool, which was nice but nothing special. We also went to the resort's beach and pool complex which was still under construction while we were there. It will be very beautiful when finished but it wasn't ideal when we were there since the water in the pools was absolutely freezing and unbearable and all of the workers were staring at me since I was in a bikini. I felt uncomfortable and didn't enjoy the experience. Overall, I would stay at the Doubletree again, I would just be sure not to eat the peanuts or wine and wouldn't eat at the restaurant again (not because there's anything wrong with the food, just because it's cheaper outside of the hotel.) I think the property has a lot of potential but will only fully realize it once the bugs associated with it being a recently opened hotel are worked out. Also worth noting is the fact that the Doubletree cookies in Jordan are VASTLY superior to the ones in California, they were truly the most delicous cookies I've ever eaten in my life!!", "title": "Lovely hotel, staff still needs training", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "November 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120641015}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed with Double Tree by Hilton in Zanzibar (Tanzania) and had fantastic experience with them and that is the reason we decided to chose Double Tree for our trip to Aqaba.", "title": "did not live upto the expectations", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Pradeep A", "date": "November 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120489169}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Though property is good but services are poor......i.e. electric bulb in one of the night lamps was missing and was not replaced despite telling housekeeping twice....", "title": "An Excellent", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Bleu-de-Chanel", "date": "October 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119755061}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011", "text": "they claim to deliver cookies on 20 minutes notice but i ordered 5 cans of cookies 2 days in advance and while checking out, they were not ready.....found a debit of 4-5 JD in my bill as a surprise...later found out it was for cookies..............cookies????? how come?? i ordered 5 cans of cookies and price of 5 cans of cookies can not be 5 JD....sir give us 5 minutes we are checking.....sorry sir, instead of 5 cans we packed 5 cookies for you........wow...anyway can i get 5 cans of cookies now.....sure sir give us 10 minutes......after waiting for 15 minutes....we were finally delivered 5 bags with cookies.....i thought it was over....but not..those bag were full of surprises...yes...cookies loosely packed without cans....why no cans???? sorry sir, we have run out of cans....oh ya...did u check with me before packing...sorry sir.........by this time i had already spent more than 30 minutes at reception waiting to clear my bill and check out.....any way i decided to return 3 out of 5 bags and they were meant to be for gifts...sir please give us another 10 minutes to correct ur bill....ok..do i have a choice...waiting for 15 minutes and still no answer....i lost my cool and talked to manager...who decided to give is 2 bags of cookies complementry as a favor for making us waiting at reception for 45 minutes....wow...........please never order cookies at Double Tree...............................Pradeep & family", "title": "So happy we came back.", "user": "fussy_bear2010", "date": "October 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 119745854}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Me, my wife and my brothers stayed there for one night on October 21 and left the hotel on October 22.
