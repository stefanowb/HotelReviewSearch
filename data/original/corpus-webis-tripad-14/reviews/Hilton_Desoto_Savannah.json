The bed skirt was not on the bed straight and was stained in several places. There was an extra vanity in the room--which was nice to have--and shelving holding a coffee maker. This part of the room, however nice it was to have, seemed to be very cheaply built. It definitely went along with the walls and strange choice of pictures. The bathroom was O.K. but the baseboards needed a thorough dusting. The TV was nice, but it was placed on a really small chest that seemed out of place in the large room.
