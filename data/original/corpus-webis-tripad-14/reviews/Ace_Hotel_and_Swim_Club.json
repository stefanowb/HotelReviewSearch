Our fist time at the Ace it proved to be an excellent choice and respite from a full family villa vacation north of PS. The resort is laid back cool and very relaxing. The rooms are smart, functional and styled for relaxation. The bed was amazingly comfortable. What I noticed is the Ace spent money where it counted with this chilled resort \u2013 beds, linen, excellent food, drinks and great service. The Service at the resort is excellent from front desk, pool service, restaurant and maid service. The clientele is a diverse selection of Angelino\u2019s from couples on there first weekend away to hipster families chilling by the pool. The Pool Muzak is awesome. I would recommend this resort to anyone who wants a relaxing break from LA.", "title": "The Ace always a hole in One!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sastudio", "date": "August 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 76514219}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our stay was amazing! We had such a great time at the beautiful pool. This was the ultimate place for relaxing... people watching... but the scene was different then your usual trendy hotel (which we really appreciated). Coming from Seattle, I would refer to the crowd as \"hipster mania\". Fedoras everywhere... lots of vintage bikinis... and a \"who cares\" attitude. The rooms were clean and very refreshing considering it was so hot outside. There were two pools onsite, one was more popular then the other... which was nice... if you wanted to just chill go to the smaller pool. Great current, but unexpected music played all day long. OH and the HAMMOCKS... we spent every evening in the hammocks... with misters going and faint sounds of music and pool life... the hammocks were an instant favorite. The hotel restaurant was an old 1960's Denny's redone... and redone well. It feels like a Denny's but its so nice... great combo. The booths are recovered in real leather and the fare is delightful and not diner food at all. The only thing that I didn't care for was the taxidermy animals in the glass case above the front desk... haha.... but avoidable and humorous. I would highly suggest this hotel. Sexy, relax, fun, and sceney but not hypocritical.

It was recommended by one of my clients and after looking at the many hotel possibilities...I decided on the Ace...the best decision ever! I went by myself and met some great people when I wanted to and was able to be by myself when I needed to . The energy and vibe was so positive and the staff always had a smile on their face and were eager to please. Not an ounce of pretentiousness or bad attitudes made for such a positive experience. The music played at the pool and spun by the DJs was some of the most relaxing and toe tapping music I have heard at a pool...not one bubble-gum pop song was played...ahhhh...so wonderful. The rooms were unique and very comfortable...along with being affordable. The people that were there all had a laid-back quality...they were there to enjoy the sun and each other...not too rowdy...but a lot of fun. It is a great mix of rockers with a lot of tattoos...along with a mixture of sun worshippers.
