Many of these inns and hotels are very expensive for an old musty room, dingy looking beds and bathrooms with no extra accomodations Obviously, this has to do with the supply and demand on such a little city, and for the most part in Avalon, I assume most people spend their time outdoors anyway. I was skeptical about the Edgewater because it seemed too good to be true; a lower price per night than it's competitors; dead-center of the boardwalk location and nice, modern looking rooms. We were very pleasantly suprised that the rooms were just as pictured and very comfortable. The hotel itself is simply an upstairs floor above a tourist shop below. A long hallway that has about 14 rooms, a kitchen alcove, an office and a sitting porch at the end of the hall, that's it!

The famous Casino was only a short walk, and the Botanic Gardens and Wrigley Memorial were a beautiful, easy hike from the Hotel.
