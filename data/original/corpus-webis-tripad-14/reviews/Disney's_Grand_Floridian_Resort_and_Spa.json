It first opened in 1988. It is still very beautiful on the outside and in the lobby. It has wonderful landscaping and floral arrangements. The complaints that I am hearing about the rooms being rundown disturbs me greatly. I know the rooms are small but that has never bothered us before because we have always loved staying at the GF. It is nice to be so close to the magic kingdom and be in the middle of all the action. You can even watch the MK fireworks from the hotel. It is fun to see the boats and the monorail on the seven seas lagoon. The wedding pavilion is gorgeous and it is nice to see the brides and bridal parties in the lobby. The problem I had with this trip was that the lobby has gotten chaotic throughout the years. Due to the fact that the GF now has tea time at 1900 park fare and the princess tea party once or twice a day in the garden view lounge and also the fact that parents let their kids do whatever they want to, the posh beautiful lobby is like grand central station or as one employee put it \"the Florida Mall\". One night when the band was playing or the pianist was playing, numerous children were jumping on couches like they were trampolines, doing cartwheels and running like they were on a playground. I know this is Disney world but this place was anything but relaxing. It is even worse when the christmas decorations are up. They bus people in from the area to see the decorations and the place is packed. I also don't like these new \"double wide\" strollers. They were every where in WDW. And I had to get out of their way numerous times or I would have been run over. I was lucky enough to stay at the brand new GF villas which are disney vacation club villas. The place is like a mini GF hotel. It is very nice but after being open for only 3 weeks the room was already showing some issues. Scratched furniture, small holes in the wall, broken things in the room etc... Our room was also not in the cleanest condition upon arrival and that really shocked me. Disney used to be known for its cleanliness but that has all changed. It is so sad. Also the quality of the food has gone downhill in restaurants on disney property. I think this could be due to the disney dining plan. I was not on the plan and had issues with the quality of food at 3 different restaurants. I love disney world and the GF and it would be very sad if this wasn't one of my vacation destinations anymore. I hope Disney listens to what people are saying and they fix the issues. People are not going to pay top dollar for rooms that are small and in dire need of renovation.

With an amazing view of the castle, we watched the light parade on the water and the fireworks 5 out of 7 nights that we were there.She was worried because there was a tree to the right of the deck that faced Cinderella's Castle.

We spent most of our pool time on the waterslide and under the waterfall. On Thankgiving evening we ate at Narcosees. The food and service were exceptional, 5 star dining, could be a little pricey if you have little ones. We watched the fireworks from our table as we ate our \"Nemo\" cupcakes.
