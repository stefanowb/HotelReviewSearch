First, the positives: absolutely great set-up if you have a small child...during the day, I just opened the door to our cottage (you could do the same with apartments) and my 3 year old just played outside in the yard/garden area in my full view, which was a safe area, not close to any roads or parking lots. This made my trip extremely laid back and enjoyable, and gave my kid freedom to just be a kid. Not sure if we could have gotten that freedom in a resort with lots of rooms and pools, etc. because of the inherent safety issues....I saw no safety issues on these grounds so could just let her play while I swung in hammock, or read in the cottage. All of the units are super close to the beach....I didn't see a single place in Grenada, other than private homes, where you could stay that close to the beach. I'm guessing 30 yards from the beach from the front door of our cottage. The cottages were large...probably 600 sf...the great room with full kitchen and sitting area is not air conditioned, but had two large fans and only screens on the windows so the temperature was perfect and A/C was needed. The bedroom had A/C but also a fan and we froze when we used the A/C the first night, so didn't use it again. For those that like their hotel room freezing, you can definitely make it happen in the bedroom. office staff and night time security guard were great. I've traveled all over the Caribbean and even lived in Bahamas and Cayman for a year and you don't get friendly faces like this anywhere else in the Caribbean...the nature of the Grenada people is shocking for us because of what we are used to from the other islanders.", "title": "Great Set-up for Families with Small Children", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Deets13", "date": "May 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 106392560}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The bay this hotel sits on is secluded and wonderful...no peddlers and lots of privacy with really only the other guests sharing the beach with you.", "title": "Paradise", "user": "spudlie", "date": "April 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 102755446}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Now for the negatives, and there weren't really any negatives, just a suggestion on how I thought they could improve...I thought the decor of the units could be improved a bit.
