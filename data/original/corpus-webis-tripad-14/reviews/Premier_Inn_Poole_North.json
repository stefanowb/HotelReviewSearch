I suppose the only answer is that they generally do what they say on the tin. The location is far from pretty but you book here because it is a one night stop-over to somewhere else rather than staying for a two week family holiday. Having said that the rooms are pretty good (much better than Weymouth, for example) and the breakfat sausages were excellent. Of note also was the friendly welcome by the reception staff.
