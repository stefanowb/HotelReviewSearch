Nice place, decent price and friendly staff. But there are too many small annoyances. Biggest being the soap, shampoo and conditioner in dispensers mounted on the shower wall. Kinda gross and not expected at this level hotel. Bring your own shampoo and use the small bar soap they leave on the sink. The ironing board is the mini compact type that you have to set on a table or bed. Extremely difficult to iron dress shirts. The hanger rack in the closet area is too low and pants touch the floor. The business center has only one computer and you have to go to the front desk to get a key. Most hotels have it so your room key works and you don't need to wait in line just to print a boarding pass. Bed is comfortable and nice pillows but covers are too thin. Breakfast is very nice and well above what you would expect with eggs, sausage, bicuits & gravy among the other basic continental breakfast items. Good coffee! The \"evening reception\" snacks were a bowl of potato chips and a bowl of pretzels. Went for a beer or wine one night and a sign said the bar was open but no attendant. You had to go to the front desk to get a drink. Many good places to eat within a couple miles.

So far the Drury Inns are exceeding our expecations. We thought we try the Pear Tree Inn in OP, KS, its right next to the Drury Inn. The diff. is we were told the Pear Tree Inn is 30 years old and Drury Inn is 10 some years old. First, you won't belive it being 30 years old. We just stayed the night before at the Ramadia Inn in Saint Joesph, MO. And you have to be kidding. That place ona scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the lowest is a neg 5 for the clean, upkeep facility. Now the staff is awesome dont' get me wrong. Its just a hotel that has been left alone and needs a major update like 5 years ago. The breakfast was great, the lady in the area was extremely helpfull, I didn't catch her name, she was very busy. Back to Peartree, they have undercover parking. I go out at night to walk our dog and talking about lights. I felt very safe with all the lights on at night. Of course I always care my mace anytime we go on trips, these days things happen. The service was outstanding, front desk, to cleaning staff to the breakfast and night snacking staff. We love this place for our first time. Our daughter goes to Missour Western, and we thinking of staying here, thats right driving 2 hours round trip if we cant get a room at the Drury Inn in St. Joe. Its that good. And you don't spend a fortune like at the other hotels. And when are hotels Presidents going to get a clue. Its time to open up your doors and allow pets to stay free. I have seen much more damage done by adults drinking and smoking than any pet could do. I sure hope hotel chain presidents can get away and start staying at these hotes and compare the quality and value to theirs. We would love to start staying at other hotels that become pet friendly. Extremely quiet, now it was a Wed night so it wasn't as full as say a weekend.
