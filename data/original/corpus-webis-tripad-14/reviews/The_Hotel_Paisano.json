The rooms are small, but have been updated. No phone in room, but you won't need it. After all, you're in Marfa. The hotel is brimming with ambiance as this 1930's hotel gives you the sense your '29 Ford is parked outside. Charm doesn't fully describe the sense of history you get when you walk into their lobby. Many a great actor and artist have passed through their doors. One can sit outside in the fountain courtyard and enjoy conversation with folks from around the world. The restaurant will complete any evening with its full assortment of meals. Beds are some of the more comfortable I've slept in when it comes to motels. Most rooms have patios with fireplaces (downstairs) or verandas (upstairs). The staff will go out of their way to make your stay comfortable.
