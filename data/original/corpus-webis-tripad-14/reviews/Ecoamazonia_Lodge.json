Lots of wildlife around to keep you entertained and local guides are very knowledgeable with a great sense of fun, so lots to see and do. Lodges are comfortable and made from natural materials to fit in with the tropical environment, all looks very pretty. Rooms have hammocks in a covered porch area for quick siestas in addition to beds in the main room. Showers are cold, but that's no bad thing after walks around the humid jungle! Also a refreshing (ie cold!) pool which is covered to stop those mossies attacking, towels provided. Food was surprisingly good and the bar does lovely (and very cheap!) cocktails. This lodge is perfect to relax in, especially if you are staying here as part of a longer and more strenuous trek around Peru!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "FayeW", "date": "October 12, 2006", "id": 5945286}], "location": {"country": "Peru", "region": "Madre de Dios Region", "continent": "South America"}, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 5, "very good": 22, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 30}, "aka": "Ecoamazonia Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "The EcoAmazonia Lodge is located in the middle of this 10,000 hectares ecological reserve known as The Tambopata; only 30km from Puerto Maldonado on the Madre de Dios River.
