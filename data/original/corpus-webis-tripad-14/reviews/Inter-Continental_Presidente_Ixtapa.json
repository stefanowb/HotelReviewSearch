I spent twelve days in Mexico. During the first four days and three nights, I stayed at the InterContinental Presidente in Ixtapa Zihuatanejo. By far, This was the best experience that I have ever had at a hotel! From the moment that I stepped out of my taxi, I was treated like a king. Everyone that I encountered was extremely friendly and always had a smile on their face. I speak very little Spanish, but that was OK, because everyone spoke both Spanish and English. My room was magnificent, complete with a breathtaking view of the ocean. I almost didn't want to leave my room; that in itself was a mini vacation, but eventually, I did. The food was spectacular, from the French restaurant and breakfast buffets to the hamburgers and hotdogs! The great thing about it, is it is all inclusive. I have stayed at \"top notch\" hotels before, and I have had the free food, and it usually tastes free, meaning tasteless, bland, and cheap, but not here. The food was was well made and done with care. The waiters and waitresses were always there, and very pleasant to be around. Several times, I forgot that my meals were all inclusive and got ready to pay the check! Aside from the room and the food, the hotel had all the comforts of home, including a business center, where I was able to go online, check my emails and pay my bills. There was also a great gym an a plethora of activities to sign up for. I really enjoyed the bike tour which consisted of a 12 mile tour to the Marina. Anytime that I needed something, there was always a smiling face waiting to help me out.To top it all off, the hot weather and the beach made my experience a dream vacation. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great vacationing getaway, for the entire family! There is much more that I can add to this review. I would like to thank the staff at InterContinental Presidente for offering the ultimate vacationing experience.

For my taste, the cuisine was outstanding (everything was very fresh). The rooms, well, that was a bit under the expectation towards a so called five star hotel, bathroom quite stingy (e.g. towels), no minibar, no ironing board, no coffee maker in room, no newspaper service, a lot of other things you usually get offered in a five star hotel (e.g. in the Indian Ocean or Middle/Far East region) were just not there. Rooms are not noise-protected, ruthless room neighbours made incredible noise at two o'clock in the morning in the adjacent room and our phone to call the reception, operator or security was out of order, but alas, in the morning, the phone worked again. Staff friendly. Swimming pool is designed for children (only about one meter deep), and in the Ocean it is mostly impossible to swim (dangerous waves). Animation bearably discrete, and there is a quiet zone. What really was a nuisance was the \"Club\" promotion touts who try to lure you into a 30 year kind of contract for USD 30'000, really ridiculous kind of concept, they are really pushing and didn't actually respect our wish to just spend leisure and they wasted almost three hours of our precious holiday time.
