Being on the 14th floor we expected good services. However, when we arrived to find a leaking toilet that would not flush, we found that the maintenance would not come and correct the situation. After calling numerous times, the following day a couple of men looked at the toilet, but did not fix it. We were later told by the manager that they needed a new bulb. They should have gotten a new bulb and fixed the toilet instead of leaving two girls in the room with out the use of the restroom.", "title": "Not so great", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ekinsey", "date": "February 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 13874890, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Not very far from a boardwalk that you could run along the ocean on", "disliked": "\u2014 Middle of Nowhere"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled on business", "text": "The door handle also fell off at one point.
