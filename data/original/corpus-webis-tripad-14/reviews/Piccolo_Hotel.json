We wanted a triple room which we had. It was bigger than any other triples in Europe that we had the previous nights. It was very clean and airy. It has air-conditioning that works which we found unique in Italy!.. Silvia and her staff are excellent. We felt like family. Prior to our arrival Silvia had sent me things to do in Florence. Our favaorite was a Tuscan cooking class and second the wine tasting tour. She had all of our tickets on our arrival and mapped everything out for us. The stay includes breakfast with great \"Americano coffee\", pastries, juice, and cereal. It was all we needed until dinner. There also was an excellent restaurant just a couple of doors down from the hotel. We were within walking distance of the Duamo and we were only two blocks from \" The David\".

Rooms are very clean and well kept. Our room had a beautiful view out of our doors of a small garden. Hotel is within walking distance form most great attractions, just watch over-charging at the train station .. the hotel is not that far to walk and should not cost over 5\u20ac .. our taxi ripped us off, but this had nothing to do with the hotel. The hotel is i a residential area that we found great, as you can be around REAL Florenteens and students, so you get a real taste of life in Florence. Our stay was SO good we stayed an extra night.

It's a charming and comfortable little hotel run by the nicest people, especially the owner who was really helpful with where to go and what to see. It's very close to most of the attractions and it's surrounded by some very good shops, restaurants, bars and (of course) trattorias!

The rooms are spacious, clean, and simple. But what makes the hotel a great choice are the little things the hotel offers that most do not. First of all, the hotel is in a great location. It is close to all of the shopping and the Duomo. Second, the hotel offers free bicycle usage to its guests. Florence is great on foot, but having a bicycle while exploring the sights was fantastic. Finally, the service is first rate... the small staff is friendly, outgoing, and personable (and very knowledgeable). The hotel is quite inexpensive, and when you factor in the quality of service and the bicycles, it is a great value! We will stay here again.
