As I requested we were given a room on a higher floor with a view. We had a lovely large corner room with views over the city and the Hofgarten park which is directly across the road from the hotel. This is one of the only hotels I have come across where they don't charge for an extra bed to be placed in the room for children. We were also lucky to get a parking space at the hotel free of charge. The room was beautifully furnished and very spacious. The breakfast although a tad expensive (but usual for this type of hotel) was very nice. The buffet was extremely well presented and food incredibly fresh and tasty. We also had dinner in the restaurant and ordered room service for the children's dinner. Again they were very accommodating. The location is superb as it's walking distance (10mins) to the centre of the city and to the main shopping precinct. The park across the road is very pretty and had a fantastic play area for the children. Most of the staff we dealt with were friendly and obliging.", "title": "Stylish hotel and great location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Familia09", "date": "April 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 62695313}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was a great hotel with lovely rooms and a great bar!
