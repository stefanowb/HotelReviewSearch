I travelled with friends who had been many times before, and they too were anxious having highly reccommended this holiday. Yes the animation team were Italian, and yes they played funky, beaty music by the pool for the aqua-gym, but a simple request, phrased with a smile, and the volume was lowered accordingly afterwards. The music was mainly Italian to begin with, but when we asked, they added British hits into the mix, and we were all happy. We spent several evenings at the sister hotel, Minos, a short taxi ride into Rethymnon, where, admittedly, the cabaret was more varied. Every single announcement beside the pool was made in English first, then German, then Italian, so absolutely nothing was missed. We even made the effort to learn a little Italian, and were rewarded by being asked out to dinner by some of the Italian animation team, and Iwo, the hotel's own Slovakian animator, whose English and German were excellent. We heard several complaints about the food while we were there, but to be honest, if you want fish and chips or Sunday roast, why are you in a Greek hotel? The food was local, with several choices, particularly from the buffet if you didn't fancy either of the two main meal choices each evening. Just because some of the food was pasta, does not make it italian, and we only had pizza once, and it was gorgeous!! The hotel staff were wonderful, and were happy to teach us a little Greek, then tolerate our hap-hazard grasp of their language with many a giggle I can tell you. We have been assured that things will be different next season, with no Eden Village, but even if they were going to be there again, I would encourage anyone to embrace the challenge, join in, and have some fun like we did.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 1, 2005", "id": 3515923}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "why not to go !", "text": "I have just returned from this hotel after a 2 week stay.
