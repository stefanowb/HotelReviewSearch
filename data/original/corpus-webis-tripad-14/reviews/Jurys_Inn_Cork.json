After having too many pints of Murphy's I stumbled across Jurys Inn. That evening I had a wonderful experience talking with Lorin, Lorraine, and Nick. I went to Cork hoping to meet some friendly people and I was not having very good luck until I met these three. They made my experience in Cork very memorable. The next time I come to visit, I will stay at Jurys Inn. Thank you for a truly wonderful perception of Ireland.", "user": "Apero", "date": "June 1, 2008", "id": 16566709}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great location... just ok.", "text": "Sincerely,", "user": "Fllblueguy", "date": "May 17, 2008", "id": 16144449}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great location!", "text": "Tanya", "user": "shouldntdrive", "date": "May 12, 2008", "id": 15961565}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Jurys Inn Cork", "text": "I have good and bad things to say about this hotel.
