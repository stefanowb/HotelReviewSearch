Like other reviewers, we found the hotel very new and well appointed. Even had new hotel smell in a good way. The free breakfast was a combination of dry foods, hot waffles, and Jimmy Dean sandwiches. The only downside we encountered was the non-existent roll-away bed that we thought was reserved with our on-line reservation. Fortunately for us, the clerk adjusted our room to two double beds without an up charge. Thank you!

We were not able to locate a hotel near them since the Blue/White Football game in State College was the same weekend (April 21, 2012). We decided to stay at the Fairfield Inn since we were able to get a great price. We did have a slight problem during check-in. When we arrived at 9PM, the person on duty was giving us a room with a King sized bed even though I reserved the room for 2 Queens. We had the reservations for over a month and it was marked guarenteed so I am not sure of the problem. When we got to the room, there was not enough bath towels for everyone. When we called down to the front desk, we were told we had to come down to pick them up. The hotel should consider having 2 employees on duty. When we went down to pick up the towels, someone else was checking in and was having a problem with their room also.", "title": "Nice hotel for weekend stay to see family", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CCCLady", "date": "April 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 128355172}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel is new and the room and bathroom were clean.
