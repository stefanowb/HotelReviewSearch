The nice touches and amenities were almost too numerous to mention. They included free snacks, soft drinks, and mineral water in the room, a cooked to order breakfast served until noon, with great bread and pastries, umbrellas for the rainy March weather, and even a very friendly cat. The location of the hotel is great-right on a canal and walking distance of the train station, Dam square, and the museums and other sites. Our room was small, but very neat and quiet. The room was also a good value for the money, although somewhat expensive for Americans due to the low value of the dollar.

There is a free standing fan provided in the room. The breakfast provided is delicious and catered to your choices. There is even a resident cat if you are missing your pets at home. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who is planning on coming to Amsterdam. Just be prepared for steep stair climbing to your room, but totally worth the individually styled rooms.
