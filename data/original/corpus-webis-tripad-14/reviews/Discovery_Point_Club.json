It is always so friendly and relaxing, plus Ollie and Diane were on spot. The welcome fruit basket and daily condo cleanings were great with three kids and a busy dive schedule. It was nice to visit with Diane daily and find out insider tips as well. It was great to not pay of shade or drinks. The ground floor units are great for running in and making a drink, getting a snack and checking out the NCAA scores on the flat screen. The only shocker was the recession along the beach; was much like down the beach in years past. But never fear, there is plenty of sand and great beach space along SMB.

Our goal was to sneak away from the cold, have some family togetherness, snorkel, feed some sting rays and relax in warm weather. Given that we had cloudy overcast weather and rain for the entire stay, we were still able to enjoy ourselves, eat good food, snorkel off the beach (albeit in the rain) and play cards on the porch overlooking palms, sand and water. This location (and frankly any of the 5 or 6 condos surrounding Discovery Point) are in a prime spot for families who want a laid back, safe, water-filled vacation. Some of our friends stay further south on 7 mile so that they can walk to breakfast, book shops and coffee places, but we were thrown off a little by the busy-ness of 7 mile road. I wouldn't want to have to walk along that street or cross that strip several times a day. It's much less busy up by DP, though you do hear traffic breeze by your master suite (parking lot side of the building).

They have a nice pool and hot tub and plenty of sun beds as it was not crowded so no need to get up early. Walks could be taken in either direction to see other resorts and it was nice that they had signs stating the name of the resorts. A little disappointed that on our side of DPC the water entry was rocky but we just moved down two resorts and then entered.. We were more interested in just relaxing and trying to get the dark tan so not that big of a deal. Ollie the manager gave us the keys to a couple of ground floor condos to view so if we ever wanted to return we could get an idea of what they were like and we were not disappointed.

I have tons of praise and no complaints about this small condo complex. We had a two-bedroom, two-bath condo (#11) on the second floor, which was lovely, clean, quiet and very comfortable. We had a beautiful view of the beach and water. You could eat dinner inside or on the screen porch overlooking the beach (no bugs, though, when we were there in April). We had all amenities -- full kitchen, laundry in the condo, A/C, cable TV, telephone, and internet service. The sandy beach is beautiful, with lots of chairs/umbrellas/cabanas to choose from. The pool was very clean, and the boys (ages 11 and 14) swam there and the ocean, but I much preferred the warm clear Caribbean ocean. We think some of the best snorkeling was right in front of our condo complex -- there are rocks and coral immediately out front full of fish. (On that note, there is no \"sandy\" swimming right out front, but you can walk a few minutes south or north, and find sandy swimming areas). The water was fantastic -- clear, warm and refreshing. The whole area is extremely safe -- we had no problem sending the boys to swim down the beach or go up to the condo on their own. Fellow travelers were varied -- other families with small children, older couples, middle-aged groups of friends... The front office (AnnRose and Ollie) are quite friendly and knowledgeable, and AnnRose will help you book anything you want to do. The rest of the staff were also extremely friendly and competent.

I was really impressed with how clean the resort is overall. We had a washer and dryer in the unit, and it came in handy for drying wet beach towels. There are beach towels provided for every unit. My children especially liked the balcony overlooking the most gorgeous view of the pool/beach/water. Most places don't have such large, completely screened in balconies. The pool is also very clean and right next to the beach, so it's possible to see your children in the pool while sitting on the beach. There are even umbrellas and chairs, all included in your rental, and we never had any problem getting one. Being so close to the Turtle Farm and Cemetary Beach is a nice plus also.
