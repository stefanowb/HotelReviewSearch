I found this new hotel on trip advisor - it was so new that it wasn't yet on most other search engines. We loved our stay, in a beautiful room with a huge fireplace, extremely comfy bed, pillows and crisp white bedding. The bathroom was an unusual arrangement, with two rooms, one with toilet and washbasin and the other housing the fabulous rainshower. The hotel is housed in a listed building and the owners aren't allowed to move walls, so each room is individual and unusual. The heating was wonderful by the way and completely silent. The staff went out of their way to be incredibly helpful and were very friendly. They upgraded us on arrival. They are keen to offer a service over and above their competition and are still being trained. The breakfast room is small, like many hotels in converted homes, and breakfast was good. The position is excellent, right in the centre of Oxford, within walking distance of the colleges, shops and restaurants. We would highly recommend this great place to stay.", "title": "Great hotel in the heart of oxford", "user": "StagJesta", "date": "February 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 151304459}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Rooms are reasonable in size, adequately heated and very comfortable.

It really is right in the heart of everything and a 10 minute walk to the station. I found the room descriptions on their website a little hard to work out the differences so we ended up with a Superior Double (the Trellis Room), which was perfect for one night and very quiet. I would have preferred a larger room for a longer stay. The conversion is fantastic, everything has been done so well. The restaurant is a little pokey, fine for breakfast (which was good) but I wouldn't have enjoyed dinner here so much. Don't let the reception area (or lack of it) put you off.

Then to crown it all, the waitress could not operate the coffee machine and the first man (boy!) who had failed to serve us our entry to the lounge had to show her. How about some basic staff training?
