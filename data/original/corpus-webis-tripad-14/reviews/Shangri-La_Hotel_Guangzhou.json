The hotel is really out of the place and you cant really walk to any shop from the hotel. Nearest mall is 15 mins by taxi. Staff Service was prompt and good. I had stayed in different hotels in China but this must be 1 of the best \"sleepable\" bed I ever stay - soft and fluffy. The breakfast was really good too with lots of choices. During 1 of the seminars, they served pork belly in wrapped pastry, it was the best pork belly i ever had. It almost melted in my mouth. Do request for this dish if you are holding your conference there. I did not have a chance to use the outdoor pool as the whole week I was there, there seemed to be some cleaning job at the outdoor pool. They gave me a free bottle of red wine as apologies when they made a mistake of sending a wrongly addressed greeting card.

The Thai restaurant within the hotel, I wouldn't say serves the best Thai food. We loved the Japanese restaurant. The reception, food [ lovely breakfast ] and beverages at the Horizon Club is the best ! The rooms do not have WiFi, but they do provide a DSL cable. The Chi Spa is a MUST try.

Our family of 4 (2 adults with 2 children ages 8 and 11) were able to book a room without additional charge through Expedia, but we had to travel 12+ stops on the Metro or sit in a taxi for an hour to get to the center of town. Rooms are spacious and nice. We had a tub and shower (with 3 shower heads). We had 2 double beds, which was tight for us. Dining wise, the best and most popular options is the Wok Too, a buffet which costs us all around 480 RMB for breakfast with a large selection for western and eastern palates. We also ate at the Italian restaurant one night which was good but expensive: 1100 RMB including 2 bottled Evians. The girls enjoyed the indoor pool (the outdoor pool was closed because they thought it was too cold - we disagreed because it was still 70 deg F), but they had strict rules about swim caps and showering before getting into the water. The hotel does have a travel desk that can book train tickets to HK and they can also arrange tours of Guangzhou. There are ATMS in the lobby. The one advantage of being on the south side of the Pearl River was a shorter taxi ride to the excellent zoo, which features 12 pandas and a large number of white tigers.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "fightinghippos10", "date": "February 20, 2011", "id": 97378704}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "The Shangri-la in Guangzhou lives up to its name and the chain's reputation.", "title": "Great Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Retired470", "date": "February 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 95699234}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Everything about our stay, beginning with the price (booked through an agency) was excellent.", "title": "Wonderful Hotel.
