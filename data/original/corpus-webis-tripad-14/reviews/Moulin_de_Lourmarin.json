This CHARMING boutique hotel, at the edge of the village, is within walking distance of the entire village and castle. We loved being able to walk to the several really good restaurants close by. The nearby shops carried merchandise we didn't find in other villages and towns. We are history buffs, so we liked the idea that it is a reconverted olive oil factory. The tasteful d\u00e9cor reflects this, without being kitschy. There are two common areas with comfy sofas and chairs where we gathered with other residents who also, didn't have Wi-Fi in their rooms (which didn't bother us because we were not there on business and actually, liked that we met interesting people, as a result.) Our standard room was of a good comfortable size and not too small. The beds were very comfortable and our room and the entire hotel was very clean. Breakfast came with our room, so we enjoyed our meals from the large buffet. The service staff at the restaurant was excellent and very accommodating. When we needed to leave very early on our last day, they provided an early breakfast for us. Sandrina and Stephen, the front desk staff with whom we interacted the most, were friendly, solicitous, accommodating, and helpful.
