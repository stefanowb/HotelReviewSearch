If you compare it to a motel, you get people raving about how clean it was - but that should really be a given at this price point (almost $200 for us). My critiques were: restaurant breakfast had few choices and eggs were overcooked, although building is gorgeous, guest rooms have cheesey lamps (looks like Leon's or something awful), and bedspreads and finishings that were more \"Best Western\" than \"boutique hotel\" - i.e., traditional but cheap. So those who say it is charming and unique must have spent more :), because our room was not like that (although certainly pleasant enough and comfortable). Also, it sounded so luxurious - but there are no extras (room service, robes, anything of this sort...).
