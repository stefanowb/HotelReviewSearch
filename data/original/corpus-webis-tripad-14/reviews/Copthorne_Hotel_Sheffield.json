One large central light is all that is needed. At dinner the waitress in the hotel's restaurant (called 1855) seemed stressed and reported that they were under staffed that night- just her on. I ordered a fish dish without the parma ham on it, as i do not eat any pork ( i told her this). She said that was fine and half way through me eating the dish i noticed bacon bits in the lentils the fish was served on. When i asked her about it, she said it was a new menu, and she was unaware that there was bacon in the lentils as well as wrapped around the fish.

Essentially this is a classic case of a modern slick design approach, neutral colours everywhere, calm and stylish. We stayed two nights for a family visit trip, nothing to do with football, a little surprised to find just how close the hotel is to Sheffield United's ground, it's basically adjoining the ground, so DO BE AWARE that on a match day this will be a chaotic place to be. Fortunately we were away all day of the Saturday, didn't return to the hotel until late evening, but we then found the hotel restaurant nearly empty and enjoyed a pleasant meal from a decent and well presented menu, with good prompt service from two excellent waitresses. I may stay again, but may also try a Sheffield hotel with a better outlook/setting, as the surroundings of The Copthorne are borderline industrial. Great car parking (they share the football ground entrance car park, as an overflow to their own bit, both are good and secure + monitored). In summary, great for location and parking, poor for setting and surroundings.
