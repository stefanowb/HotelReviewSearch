The vallet asked our names, went inside to I guess let the front dest know our names and came back out watching us unload our car. We were told that we had to get everything out now that we would want because they park the cars in different garages and it wouldn't be easily accesible for us to get our belongings in and out.

I couldn't believe that they waited for us to remove all of our luggage from the car at the curb before they explained to us we were not staying there. I thought that was incredibly rude. I also found it odd that other guests were coming in and checking in with no problems. If the motel was infact double booked, then why didn't they send people off based on a first come first serve basis? Also, they had 2 contact numbers for me, one which was my cellular phone which I had on myself. Why no phone call about the change in plans? Honestly, I believe that the 'double booking' story I was given was complete crap. I am assuming that because there were other events going on in the city at the same time, they probably got more money for the rooms, so they sent us on our way or something to that effect.

However, the desk clerk changed and we were later told that we had a standard queen room. There was a sign posted outside of the door that stated, \"Chemicals on the premises may cause cancer or be a danger to pregnant women.\" What??? The exact wording may not be there, but the point was clear. We asked the desk attendant about the sign and he sputtered something about the kitchen and keeping people out of the alley. Our room seemed as if it hadn't been dusted in several months. Also, we had difficulty getting our luggage in the room due to it's EXTRAORDINARILY small size. The bed was supposed to be a \"queen,\" but was actually full-sized. The sheets were scratchy and deposited lint on my black pants. The pillows were small and flat.

The bed (as opposed to last reviewer) was just fine and it was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was cut above average. Yes, the room was fairly small, but they're all like that in SF.

When I asked the desk, I was told, \"Oh, you can ask a waiter in the restaurant\" (and, I assume, pay $4 a cup or whatever for coffee). Would it kill them to put a pot in the lobby?
