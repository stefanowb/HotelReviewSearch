Really all that has been said before was exactly as it is. I stayed with my 2 children (8 & 10) in the Busakorn Wing. it was originally 3 nights there then over to the Main Wing but I found the bed setup in the Busakorn worked better for us so upgraded for the other 6 nights. Only cost an extra $100 so wasn't a problem. If you want piece and quiet at breakfast time head to the Busakorn as the Main Wing is very noisy and busy. They both have virtually the same food. The Busakorn pool lounges are reserved for Busakorn guests only which is Ok but the lounge hogs really need to be sorted out. Towels were on lounges from 6.30 then not used for hours then at lunchtime lounges would be left with books etc and nobody there for hours. The hotel really needs to sort out this problem as it isn't fair for everyone. They have staff monitoring the situation but don't really take towels away too often although they do watch out for main wing people using the lounges which i didn't see as a big a problem. The over 12 club is fantastic place for the kids when they are oh so over shopping.
