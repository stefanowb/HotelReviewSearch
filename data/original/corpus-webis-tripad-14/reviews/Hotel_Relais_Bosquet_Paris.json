We enjoyed leisurely breakfasts in our apartment with croissants from the corner bakery. Nights when we didn't want to go out for dinner we would just stay in and cook something. As for the apartment, the major pros are that it is clean, and connected to the hotel, so there were housecleaning services every other day. The location is excellent. The major con is that it is small...only suitable for 2 people who know each other well. It has Murphy beds and an Ikea-type kitchen. The bathroom is small and the toilet is just off the living room.

I do not understand why they gave us the worst room when we booked months in advance and stayed at the hotel twice before.
