Was able to attend a presentation by one of the kibbutz members and it was so informative. All the staff were very nice and did whatever they could to make our stay comfortable. Breakfast and dinner buffets were wonderful. This is a busy kibbutzz, but considering that, the care given to guests was outstanding. The accommodations could be viewed as modest, but kept clean. The lobby was very nice, and there's a unique little shop in lobby area.

The quiet and beauty of the kibbutz along with the friendliness of the kibbutz members make for a unique experience that you can't get at a 'city hotel.'
