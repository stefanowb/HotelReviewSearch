Perfect for weddings or celebrating anniversaries and birthdays with loved ones. The whole family can enjoy all that is on offer \u2014 like the kids Playzone and the Mez, which offers movies, gaming consoles and a small cinema. There are also rooms set up just for families.

We stayed in a family suite which was very nice, really lovey decor, very comfortable, very high quality furnishings. And a lovely big bath! Breakfast in the conservatory was excellent, a real highlight, great way to start the day. Food at the Gumstool Inn was slightly hit and miss, but overall ok. We didn't like the decor of the Gumstool so much, it feels a bit new and not much character as pubs go, not really as good as the rest of the hotel. But children's tea there was excellent. The spa is lovely, we both had massages there which were very good. The children's playground is small but adequate. We put our children in the cr\u00e8che a lot and were very happy with it and the staff there were lovely. The pool was great, we didn't have a problem with the set times for children's swimming and they provide lots of toys for the pool. Dinner in the conservatory restaurant was very good indeed. There is lots to do within a 15-45 minute drive. We visited Tetbury a few times (some great clothes shops!), Cirencester which was beautiful, Castle Combe was a gorgeous village to wander round, and we took the children to Bowood House & Gardens which has absolutely amazing grounds and a fantastic adventure playground - highly recommended. We also had lunch at Hunter Hall, a pub just around the corner with a big garden and great playground. We walked the trim trail at Calcot Manor, a nice easy stroll, though at one point lots of nasty bugs! We had a lovely overall stay there and would recommend it to those with small children who want somewhere nice for themselves as well. The staff overall were very young and occasionally green, but that didn't matter as they were extremely friendly and eager to please.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "DianeM32", "date": "July 1, 2012", "id": 133189317}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I have grown with Calcot Manor from the late 80's when Michelin stars and cloches were all the rage to the present day, they respond to trends staying fresh and interesting, the bedrooms are to die for, the food amazing in both the Conservatory and the Gumstool Inn and the Spa is a WOW, the service throughout is fabulous.

I went with my Mum and my 2 yr old daughter. The place was so freindly and so aimed at children. There is a playzone where parents can stay or leave their child which was lovely as my daughter doensnt like to be left. The whole place has a very relaxing feel about it. At breakfast time there are bibs and crockery especially for children and there is a high tea served at half 5 for children which is excellent food that my daughter really enjoyed. The spa was fantastic, where I had a great massage and you can take your children swimming (at a certain time of day). The gym there is small but great equipment. Only had a very slight problem, of once ordering a drink and it never coming, asking for assistance from reception and it not coming so having to ask again, and having to ask twice for our dinner trays from room service to be collected. But all of this doesnt really matter as the place is so fantastic. We stayed in a Woodchester which has a serperate room for the children, the whole room upstaris is a massive double bathroom and the bedroom was huge!! The only thing that I could say is that as my daughter is only two, the floors are quite slippy as they're wooden and so are the steps so I couldnt keep her socks on as she kept slipping.

My only regret is that I forgot to pack a swimming costume for enjoying the spa fully (don't make this mistake!), although I did go for a jog on the running route through the gorgeous countryside - and had an excellent scalp massage.
