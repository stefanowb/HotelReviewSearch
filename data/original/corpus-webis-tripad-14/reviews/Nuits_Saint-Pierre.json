We stayed for two nights and had a wonderful experience. The B&B decor is modern and very pleasant with a small sofa at the foot of the bed. The bathroom featured a large shower. WiFi service allowed us to stay in touch with home. We enjoyed the breakfasts, which had quite a variety of continental items but also eggs cooked to order. The nearby cathedral bells start marking the hour at 7 am, but we enjoyed this.", "title": "A very comfortable bed and breakfast", "user": "rnathan", "date": "October 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180514909}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Located in the center of town.

From the moment we arrived the staff/owner is a real treat. She met us at the airport and gave us some tips on what to do on her little island. We checked into a nicely appointed room with a private bath. The breakfast included in the room rate was delicious and plentiful. You couldn't ask for a better location, walking distance to everything. The local information they provide at the B&B gives you all the scoop on the things to do on the 3 islands you can visit during your stay. I also recommend a visit to the Tea Room - the deserts and the cheese plates are yummy!!", "title": "Wonderful B&B", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MLeaton", "date": "September 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 175607210}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I took my 88 year old Mother to St. Pierre and stayed here for three days.
