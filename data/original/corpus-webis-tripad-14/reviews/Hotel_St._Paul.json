The lobby is small but very cool with an open marble fireplace and lounging chairs. Our first room was small and its window faced the fire escape. We also had the misfortune of having a loud couple a few doors down - we could hear EVERYTHING they were doing, in addition to peole knocking on others' doors, people on cell phones in he hallway etc. I would say the hotel had less sound proofing than your typical chain hotel, which is frustrating. The room itself was minimal yet cozy, with faux fur blanket, flat screen tv, a huge mirror leaning against the wall, and nice bathroom. The breakfast was good, too.", "user": "tvlbug", "date": "September 1, 2006", "id": 5731898}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Unique and Cultured", "text": "Our second night we switched to a larger room, with a window overlooking McGill Street.

The attendees helped me with my baggage and parked my car in their open air garage right after I pulled up. Upon being helped in the Hotel, I was dazzled by the fireplace in the lobby. The concierge were very nice throughout my stay and actually helped me find directions to the La Ronde amusement park for the fireworks competition (Argentina). The penthouse that I booked was impressive in the fact that it resembled a New York City Studio sized apartment. The high cielings along with tall windows are impressive and the lighting in the room was unique. Inside, features are minimal and simplistic to the point that it encourages you to relax on the very comfortable bed. Please set the alarm **hehehe**. The LCD TV also adds to the simplistic nature of the environment. The only downside was that I couldn't find any drawers for my clothes, though, there is a closet to hang my clothes. For those who like more room, go and book the suites in advance. Please bring a laptop if you have one, since internet there is complimentary and it really helps with finding directions to all your destinations. The Hotel St Paul is in a strategic location where you can hit most of the scenes on St Paul Street and the Harbor. Restaurants and Souveneirs Stores are abundant around that area and truly adds to the magic of living there. I recommend eating at the Papallion for the Salmon and THE KEG for the Steaks. Also try this ice cream shop near the Hotel on St Paul Street. It's a million flavors with smoothness to back it up.. Bottom line, St. Paul is definitely an experience and I would recommend it for anyone looking for unique, tasteful, comfort. \"Book and Rest\"", "user": "ElizHog", "date": "June 27, 2006", "id": 5395450}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing anniversary stay!", "text": "We just spent five nights in the St Paul and had a lovely stay. The hotel is in a good location in the old town and is about a 10 min walk up to the main shopping area of Rue St Catherine. The hotel is chic and minimalist in style. The room was very comfortable and kept very clean during our stay. We have no complaintsl. You should not be disappointed with your stay at this hotel. The hotel's restaurant seems quite expensive though. There's plenty of places to eat in Montreal's old town and up in the new town....", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 26, 2006", "id": 5392650}], "location": {}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 29, "average": 55, "very good": 122, "terrible": 14, "excellent": 215}, "aka": "Hotel St Paul", "slim_ranking": 0.229411764706, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Located at the gateway of Old Montreal, Hotel St-Paul is on McGill Street at the corner of St-Paul.
