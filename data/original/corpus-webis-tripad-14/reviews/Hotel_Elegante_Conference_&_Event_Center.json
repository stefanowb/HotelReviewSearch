This was during the Waldo Canyon fire in CS--further north. The staff was amazing. Considering that 32,000 people evacuated from their homes, the staff was on overdrive. I personally saw the concierges console and comfort people, create wait lists for those who needed rooms or to continue to stay, and juggle everything they were doing to make sure those who needed to stay could. There were at least two conventions in the hotel while we were there, and the hotel is busy and efficient. The hotel has been upgraded at some recent point; the pool areas are very nice (I wouldn't stay in the rooms near the indoor pool--noisy as you would expect with children); the bar is cozy and has great service; the restaurant is okay foodwise but well-staffed and run by attentive people. There is a fenced in dog play-park with doggy bags provided, plus an excellent fitness center (for the humans) with good machines, free weights, refrigerated wet towels, TV, etc. Excellent beds, A/C, flat-screen TV, coffee machine (like a Keuria). This isn't a resort hotel, but we had a nice vacay for a weekend. By the way--one thing that is notable: like at the Broadmoor, as a guest you will never pass a staff member without being greeted with a smile and a \"hello, good morning,\" etc. Friendly and willing staff!
