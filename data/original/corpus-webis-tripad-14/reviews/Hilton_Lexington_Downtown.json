I must admit that my disappointment is largely my fault. The Hilton website for this hotel clearly states that they allow pets for a $100 fee, so I can't complain about being surprised. I hadn't checked that site. I simply noted that the hotel's summary info online indicated that it was \"pet friendly.\" My surprise came from the fact that I didn't go to the hotel's detailed site and read about the fee, so I can't say that they didn't provide warning, but a $100 fee is outrageous. I understand that, especially when you have a nice, clean, newly-renovated hotel, you want to keep it that way as long as possible, but there must be a better way. Our dog is small, doesn't bark, doesn't chew things and is completely potty-trained, so doesn't make messes. She is also a hypo-allergenic breed that doesn't cause a reaction in people who are allergic to dogs. (That's the justification that most hotels use for charging a pet fee - they say that due to allergies in some guests, they must take extra steps in cleaning a room in which a dog has stayed, even if there is no mess.) I don't expect to have the dog stay without a fee, even though, in our case, the dog's impact on the room and other guests is non-existent, but I have a hard time believing that any \"extra cleaning\" amounts to $100. Are they really going to put an extra $100 of effort into that room? I seriously doubt that they did anything to our room after we checked out that they wouldn't have done otherwise. What it really amounts to, is that they don't want dogs in their hotel, but they still want to list themselves as \"pet friendly,\" so they set their fee so high that it keeps guests with dogs away.
