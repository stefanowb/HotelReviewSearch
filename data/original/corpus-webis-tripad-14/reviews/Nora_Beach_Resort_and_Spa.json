When we first arrived, it was just after Bangkok airport reopened so the hotel was very quiet, only 40 people staying there when normally there would be 250 but we liked this, it was very peaceful. We stayed in a nora villa which was lovely, we liked the little courtyard with the outdoor shower. The room was always clean except we did have to be careful about leaving food or drinks on the bedside tables as it would create an ant problem (on the last day of our holiday they were doing a big bug spray). The pool was fantastic and the pool bar staff were extremely friendly. We didn't eat in the restaurant, instead going into cheweng or down the road for some cheaper food. There are only a couple of restaurants sort of down the road from the Nora but if you're after cheap Thai food then they're the places to go. The free shuttle into cheweng runs at 10:30 and 3, if you want to go in at night it costs 50 baht per person and runs at 5, 6 and 7 and i think maybe theres a later one. Speaking of costs into cheweng, most taxi drivers want 200 baht but you can get them down to 100, sometimes you have to give in and pay 150 but the trip really isnt that long, we walked it a couple of times. Just a word of warning, don't try and walk from Cheweng beach to the nora beach unless you're willing to get wet and walk on rocks, we thought it would be a pleasant walk but changed our minds just as we were nearing home, oh well it was worth the laugh!", "title": "Loved it!

That might sound silly but it took us 2 days to figure out how to actually get on to the beach, we met another couple who had been there 6 days and still couldnt find it. It really is a beautiful beach. Also, i can recommend the funny day safari tour, somewhere between thinking i was going to die driving through the mountain on an ex military jeep to having to buy things just to use a toilet at the big buddha, it was the funniest day of my life. The Ang thong marine park tour was a let down, probably due to a boatful of sea sick passengers (including myself) but the view was spectacular. Also, check out the lady boy cabaret show near the Combi van bar (you'll see the ladyboys promoting it), it's free you just have to buy you're drinks and it is the funniest thing, especially when they get guys from the audience up on stage, but i wont ruin it for you. it's starts around 10pm in Cheweng.", "title": "A must stay!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "amdonley", "date": "December 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 22897704, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beautiful room, great beach, pool, and food.", "disliked": "\u2014 we loved everything!!!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled with family", "text": "My only critism of Nora would have to be the prices of food and drinks. Cocktails were 180-190 baht, 50% off in happy hour but you still had to pay the 17% service charge of the normal price so they ended up being about 115 Baht in happy hour (2-3pm at the pool bar, 6-7pm at the beach bar). Food was also very expensive, 250 Baht for light meals at the pool bar, for us that was about $12 as the exhange rate was so low. However, every day they had a lunch special by the pool which would cost 190 Baht, we had it once and it was very nice. One more thing, try hiring the kayak from the hotel and paddle out to the island you can see just off shore, take some baht with you because they have beers and drinks and stuff to sell, it's only a little shack but the people that run it live on the island and are goat farmers, it's a really nice little beach to relax on.", "title": "really is paradise", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "terrortots", "date": "November 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 22097650}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We visited here for our anniversary.

The staff also assisted us in booking a private car to tour the island for a full day, and recommended great restaurants in town (go to the Library!!!).
