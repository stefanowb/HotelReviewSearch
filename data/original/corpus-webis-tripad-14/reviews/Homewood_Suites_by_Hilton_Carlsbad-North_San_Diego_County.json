With 4 small kids, it is really hard to keep things in line and when things like the weather get in the way, any help I can get is wonderful and they went above and beyond! I also had an emergancy with my 1year old who can not sleep without her blanky. Which had gotten dirty. My daughter was already asleep and we thought we were in the clear. Not the case. It was after midnight and the sign says no washes after midnight. I went to the front desk and they were so nice!

Tip: if you're going to Legoland, book the hotel through the Legoland website; it's $30 cheaper than booking online through the hotel website. The suite was big enough to accommodate our family, and there's a sofa bed, if needed. There was a little shop where you can buy frozen pizza, ice cream, or chips. The free breakfast buffet was great. It's in the hotel lobby, and there's hot foods (eggs, pancakes, etc.) as well as different breads and muffins. There was a toaster that toast bread as well as bagels. They had oatmeal, cereal, juices, and coffee. They even have a belgian waffle maker.
