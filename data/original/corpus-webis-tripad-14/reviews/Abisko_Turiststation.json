We walked to it - 5 mins from the train station (coming from Kiruna) so it was pretty convenient, though there was a big queue at reception when we arrived (a tour group got there just before us). We were annoyed that they asked for an extra \u00a320 as they said a mistake had been made in our bill, even though we showed them an email that said we had fully paid. I didn't bother to argue but it left a bit of a sour taste given how much we'd already paid. They were, though, helpful in arranging a taxi back and answering our questions. The evening meal is included but there was no choice and my partner didn't fancy some of the courses so we went to the hotel's own shop and bought pizzas, which we cooked up in the kitchen (in a separate building). I liked the bar area and the lounge with real fire blazing. I didn't try the sauna or other activities available (eg husky sledding). The room was quite small with 2 single beds (I hate that when you want a double) and a slightly cheap-looking 'wet-room' style shower (ie a curtained off area next to the toilet). It's about 15-20 mins walk to the base of the chairlift up to the sky station - I'm surprised they don't offer free shuttles, at least around the opening time (8pm). It's a great experience going up to the sky station - thankfully they offer warm clothing as we went up through a blizzard.
