My introduction to the Santa Maria Harbour Resort was meeting Ibrahim during check in. Ibrahim was a sweet man who assisted us with directions to the beach, places to eat, etc. Our room was upgraded to a beautiful 2 bedroom suite. The room was fabulous, not only did my friend and I each have our own bedrooms, but our own bathrooms too! The kitchen was fully stocked and very clean. There was a nice dining table, beautiful screened patio, and a nice seating area in the living room. The in-room washer/dryer was exceptionally handy as well!! The pool, bbq and shuffleboard area was always clean and there was never a lack of chairs, tables in which to sit and relax. I was totally impressed with Santa Maria Harbour Resort and would stay there again in a heartbeat!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "jparks2007", "date": "April 22, 2006", "id": 4995801}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "We stayed here with two kids in a 2 BR and loved it.
