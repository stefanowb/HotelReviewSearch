It's fairly new, and has many of the amenities of a large hotel. The lobby is large, roomy, with many places to sit and relax. There ia a lounge where you can order a drink and snacks. The sweet potato fries are delicious and for the price you get a large basket with dipping sauce. There is a small area set aside for two computers and one reserved only for printing airline boarding passes, a wonderful convenience. If you have forgotten something, there is a place to buy personal items as well as snacks and drinks, nice since the rooms have both refrigerators and microwaves, as well as a one cup coffee maker. On my first night, as I had just finished my shower, the power went out in my room. Katie, the front desk woman, ably took care of the problem, promptly finding me a new room, and even helping me take my baggage to it. The rooms are nice, with comfortable beds, 5 pillows, a flat screen TV that swivels between the bed area or the sitting area that has a couch/sofabed. There's also a desk with Net connection. The bathroom is especially nice, with the shower/sink in one room and a toilet/sink in another. The shower is quite large with separate lighting.There's a pool and viewing deck on the 24th floor, with views of Vegas all around. The exercise room has nice equipment and was being used by customers much of the time. The best thing about this hotel that helps budgets is the morning buffet breakfast. This is no continental breakfast most hotels have. We had pastries, bagels and toast with the necessary toppings, 6 different kinds of cereal for both the kids and adults, hot oatmeal, yogurts, scrambed eggs, meats (we had turkey and pork sausage and canadian bacon), and 2 waffle makers. Coffee, milk and juices round out the choices. For a family, think of what you can save on one meal a day! I have one complaint, but this is due more to my technical ineptitude so be forewarned. The usual clock/radio has been replaced by an ipod docking port. I couldn't set the alarm no matter how many times I read the instructions. So I tended to wake up frequently during the night.", "title": "Not perfect but darn close!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LisaMSacramentoCA", "date": "August 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 74545062}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "But if you're in the need of good clean housing while in Vegas, check out this hotel.

The building just recently opened, is well appointed, room are spacious with separate sleeping area and sitting area, separate bathroom/shower and toilet. Room are well furnished, modern and very comfortable (as in all Marriotts, their beds are great) Staff and check in were very uneventfull and very friendly. There is a small heated pool in the roofdeck, as well as a fire pit. Breakfast is included with the room rates and, unlike some reports of other travellers, it was always stocked and replenished - everything from eggs, wafles, fresh fruite, bagels, pastries, juices, yoghurt, etc - an excellent breakfast buffet. Breakfast is served in the very spacious and airy lobby. We had a rental car - there is a parking garage on the lower floors of the building (parking is free). Drive from the hotel to the Strip is a few minutes (parking at hotels on the Strip such as Bellagio, Venetian is free). Walking from Springhill Suites is also an option - we walked several times, but are avid walkers (so this wasn't a problem) - a leisurely walk is about 10 - 15 min to the Strip. The metro train station is across the street by the Hilton - we never used it. Hotel has computers in the lobby to access your email and print boarding passes. Apart from eating breakfast there, we did not sample the food or the bar. It is not an upscale luxury hotel - we knew that - but an incredibly good value, since we did not want to stay right on the strip.
