If you walk out in the water and look down you can see a starfish here and there. Every village had there own pools. You had your choice of large pool with activities with a swim up bar or the quiet pool in Dutch village or french pool with restaraunt and swim up bar.

We stayed there from August 24-August 29, 2006 for vacation. The resort is gorgeous, beautiful landscaping, white beaches, spacious. We never felt cramped, Sandals Whitehouse is such a large resort that it always feels as though it is a slow time. The staff is remarkable, they seem just as happy to be there as the guests are. It has three different themed areas, French, Italian, and Dutch. We stayed in the Italian and it was perfect, basically right in the middle of the resort so we were close to everything, although with how beautiful the resort is, walking from one end to the other is nothing to complain about. We booked in concierge level room, and when we got there they upgraded us to concierge suite. The food and drinks are also wonderful...plenty of options. Have a dirty banana and visit Tummings, the bartender at the main pool bar. I enjoyed eating at Bayside. The atmosphere was so relaxing, the outside tables are right along the beach with a beautiful fountain next to them. They served a large buffet for breakfast every morning. Monday nights they have a huge dinner buffet which is to die for, they have ice sculptures and so much variety you won't know where to start. I thought Eleanor's would be my favorite restaurant but it ended up being my least favorite. Giuseppe's chicken parm. is a must. As for excursions...we did the YS Falls excursion and the Fonthill horseback riding excursion and they were both worth every penny. I wouldn't recommend either of these for anyone who cannot move around easily as it can be a bit physically demanding, but they were both such wonderful experiences. At the YS Falls excursion you actually climb through the falls, and the guys there are willing to take as many pictures for you as you want. You can also swing off of ropes into the falls. Take water shoes. It is about a 45 min. drive there. With the horseback riding we were first time riders and no problems at all...it may just take a few minutes to get the feel of being on a horse but the horses are extremely well-trained. You ride through a path in a wooded area to the beach where you ride through the water. If you go, say hello to Prince Charles for me! This excursion is about a 20 min. drive there. Remember to take money with you for tipping as the excursions and the drivers to and from are not part of Sandals. We did not do the spa, although we did tour the facilities which are amazing, and even booked treatments but ended up cancelling due to sunburn. This resort really is nothing short of a tropical paradise. I've heard people complain of the ride to the resort from the airport which is an hour and a half ride, but it is nothing to complain about. I actually really enjoyed it as it allows you to see parts of Jamaica you probably wouldn't see otherwise. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a getaway from the realworld.

A week or so before we were due to arrive I mailed them again, we particularly wanted to see the ocean and sunsets from our room. I was concerned since I understood that as we had booked the lowest room category our view may be obscured by the trees/bushes or whatever. Within a few hours I had received a reply saying that an upper floor in the Dutch area would give us the best sunset views and that they would see if they could accommodate our wishes.

We had read some reviews of the resort that were negative. I don't know which resort these people stayed at. This was THE best sun vacation we ever had. We arrived after a 11/2 drive from Montego Bay. We did not have to touch our luggage until it was placed in our room. We were offered wet towels and champagne on arrival and sat in the beautiful lobby for 10 minutes or so while our check in details were all handled by the resort staff. We were then driven by golf cart to our room in the French Village. Upon arrival, we were introduced to Kevin Hughes, the food and beverage manager for the resort. Kevin kindly made dining suggestions, reserved a table for us at the restaurant of our choice, and asked us what type of wines we preferred. Our preferred vintage was waiting for us with our table at the Bayside restaurant at the resort. Kevin ensured that we were contacted daily about our dining choices etc. and ensured that we had a great table. Kevin and his staff are THE best. We have never had such amazing service like this anywhere. His staff were very attentive, assistants Amber and Alexander, waiter Chris, chef Senior, were always willing to help and assist us at any time. I hope we didn't forget anyone. On our last night, Kevin arranged a romantic dinner for us on the beach complete with white glove service, champagne, custom menu based on discussion with us, wine, photos, and serenade from the waiters (Anthony and Vinny), waitress Shaneika (also excellent !) and Malcolm the photographer. Kevin, thanks again for making our week spectacular. I will emphasize that ALL of the Sandal's staff are totally service oriented from front desk, housekeeping, watersports, the nurse...I could go on and on. Now as for the resort, we stayed in the French village in a luxury room. The room had mahogany furniture, four poster bed and wall unit and was spotless. Towels were replaced with turndown service and housekeeping promptly dealt with any requests we had. The minibar was stocked with complimentary soft drinks and water. The french village is furthest from the main piazza but believe me, after sampling the food and snacks at all of the Sandals restaurants, we needed the walk. Each 'village' has it's own pool. The french village pool was a little more raucous and much of the pool volleyball etc was played there. We stayed mainly on the beach, the dutch village pool, (quiet..very relaxing) and the main pool, which is gorgeous and more like a lake its so large. We never had a problem getting lounge chairs or towels. We were told they allow two chairs for every guest. I'm inclined to believe that. There was a daily acquasize class at 10:30 am led by Michael in the main pool This was a blast and many guests participate. We didn't use the gym but we hear it was excellent. The watersports were of course all complimentary and we tried windsurfing and waterskiing. The staff on the beach were very helpful with instruction as well as patient. As for the food, there were many dining choices, Bayside was more continental with various meat and seafood choices. We enjoyed the ambience eating out on the patio looking at the stars, the ocean, the fountain and gardens, casually, but with 1st class service. Extra portions were never a problem and we were able to mix and match entrees, i.e. lobster tails were always available upon request and/or shrimp with any other entree. Eleanor's was more formal (no shorts or jeans) and there were many different menu choices. The filet mignon and lobster bisque was excellent and we ate there twice. Jasmine's was also very good as well with choices for Asian and Japanese food. We didn't do dinner at Giuseppe's although we did have a lunch pizza from there by the pool and it was excellent. The Cafe de Paris has wonderful pastries made on premises, soft serve and hard ice cream, and all types of coffee and lattes and is open all day and evening. The pastry chef, Parmazu (not sure if I spelled it correctly so I apologize in advance) or ParmaPoo as the staff call him (jokingly of course) is incredible. On Tuesday night, he did the chocolate buffet, do not miss this ! It is a chocoholics dream. Breakfast was available either with table service at Eleanor's or buffet at the Bayside and there was a huge selection of eggs, pancakes..you name it. The omelette stations were great as well. We paid extra to have West Indian massages at the Redlane Spa. I highly recommend it. The grounds at the resort are magnificent, clipped and manicured daily with beautiful flowers and gardens. The beach is several miles long, white sand and you can find a private spot pretty much any time. The shops at the resort are well stocked and very clean with many choices. The staff at the shops were also very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. This really is the first resort we've ever been to where we have no criticism. We plan to return next year at the same time and would go back sooner if we could swing it. If you are looking for a place to relax, be pamperd, chill out, enjoy some fine dining and enjoy total relaxation, then the Whitehouse is for you ! We will most definitely be returning ( already counting the days).

The room also included a closet for hanging clothes and a decent-sized safe that easily held everything we wanted secured (wallet, purse, traveling documents, jewelry, etc.). The balcony was wonderful! It had a small table and two chairs for breakfast or relaxing. The greatest part was that there was a long rack to hang swimsuits on to dry \u2013 which we found to be a huge asset during our stay. The view included part of the Dutch Village pool and, of course, the beach and ocean.", "title": "We fell in love with each other all over again", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "sharonja65", "date": "April 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 29056781}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The location was absolutely perfect \u2013 and completely worth the 90-minute drive!

We complained again and they did move us to a walkout room in the French village. Not what we asked for but we took it anyway. We asked for a bottle of wine but they told us there was no room service in the French village.
