Staff were very helpful and extremely courteous.The reception area with it's beautiful Christmas tree, had a wonderful aroma of Christmas, creating a lovely ambience. This delightful hotel is perfectly placed with fantastic views of the old town across the river. The food was amazing, wonderful breakfasts including champagne and delicious Christmas menus with corresponding wines. A little pricey maybe but worth every penny.
