It is very hard to summarise really. The hotel itself is well located overlooking Lake windermere (although fairly high up) - you are not 'on the lake' but the views are stunning nevertheless.

The hotel claims to have a 'family friendly' feel, although im not sure this was the case. The difficulty is understanding why - what is essentially (or could be) a perfectly well run, well located, family friendly hotel, that is being run more as an a'la carte restaurant with rooms on the side'. Dont get me wrong we thought the food itself was lovely. However, we didnt go to the lake district and we didnt choose the hotel on the basis of wanting to eat amazing food, we booked it to relax, chill out and enjoy the surroundings. The problem; not only do they 'presume' and encourage you to have dinner included in your stay, they do request that you 'come down for dinner 30 minutes prior to the time you have booked' so you can enjoy the canapes and have a drink - fine, except that this instruction seemed a little regimented. In addition, we werent expecting for the atmosphere to be quite so 'quiet, stuffy and impersonal'. We had only taken jeans/casual clothes and felt extremley out of place at dinner where outsiders had obviously come to dine and were dressed extremley smartly. The restaurant itself is very outdated and they had a piano player in the background who was a lovely guy but again - piano playing!? - it all just seemed a little outdated. The menu was set every evening with a choice of up to 8 options - starters and mains that you could swap / change. Even so this didnt differ on a week to week basis and even after 2 nights I had enjoyed the options wanted and was grateful for not having to endure the same again on the 3rd night.", "title": "Marvellous views", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Chestnuts", "date": "June 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7873425, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The relaxed friendly atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Could do with a lick of paint....."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall the food was lovely.
