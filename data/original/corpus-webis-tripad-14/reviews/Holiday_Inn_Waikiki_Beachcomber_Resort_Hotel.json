Of course it's hard not to have a great time when you're in Hawaii. The location of the hotel could not have been more perfect. A lot of hotels in the Waikiki area claim to be close to the beach, but are actually blocks away. This hotel really is directly across the street. It's right across from the Royal Hawaiian (Honolulu's famous \"Pink Palace of the Pacific). It took us less than 10 minutes from our 20th floor hotel room to be out basking on the beach. I would say that this hotel's #1 attribute is where it's located. It's also right next door to the International Marketplace and it's pretty much right in the middle of Waikiki so it's easy to walk everywhere rather than take a bus or cab. The 2nd best thing about this hotel was the service we received. The hotel staff is very friendly and accomodating. Every single hotel employee we dealt with greeted us warmly and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. They were also very helpful about giving us tips on things to do/places to eat, etc in Waikiki. The 3rd best thing about the hotel is that all the rooms (at least as far as I know) have their own balcony, and at least two-thirds of the hotel rooms have a partial-ocean-view. Upon check-in, we were actually given 1-time entry keys and allowed to view a few different rooms on our own so we were able to pick which room we wanted. Here's what I didn't particularly care for. When I'm on vacation, I don't spend much time in the hotel, so I'm usually not too picky. I just like things to be clean and well-maintained. This hotel is definitely in need of a major renovation. It's somewhat outdated and the rooms appear somewhat worn. There were some stains in the carpet and the rooms just have an overall appearance of needing some love. The maids did a very good job of cleaning our room and re-stocking used items without us having to ask. But, you can only do so much with an old worn-down room. However, we were told by a couple of staff members that by this time next year, all the rooms will have undergone a complete renovation. Another minor quibble I have was the water pressure.
