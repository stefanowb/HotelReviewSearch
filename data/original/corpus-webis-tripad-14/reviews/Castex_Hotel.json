The Castex, unbelievably, is on a quiet street just 2 blocks from the Bastille which is normally quite active with restaurants, cafes, shops, nightlife, and cars. The hotel is also on the edge of the Marais, so it's a short walk to the features in that area, too. The price was average for the area. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but they are pleasantly, if simply, decorated. The bathroom was of good size. The windows were double-glazed. I was on the back side of the hotel, so it was really quiet. The view was toward other buildings, but as there was the tiny courtyard below, it wasn't claustrophic. The room had individual climate control. The staff on the desk were all pleasant, though my interaction was rather limited, not being a first time traveler to Paris. The elevator was big enough for 2 or 3 people with luggage. The biggest plus of all was free wireless internet access. The other hotels I looked into around there in that class all charged heinous fees for wi-fi. My only two negatives are 1) though the bed was comfy, the mattress was slumping and due for replacement and 2) there was a mildew smell from the bathroom. I think the problem was poor ventilation and there's probably not a good fix for that. Anyway, with the door closed, it wasn't a bother.", "title": "Nice hotel in an excellent location", "user": "Massimo1", "date": "January 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 23930027, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location,free wi-fi", "disliked": "\u2014 mildew smell from bathroom, mattress due for replacement"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have to say, having read tons of reviews of Paris hotels, is that what most people fail to note about central Paris is that so many of the hotels are buildings that were converted or were hotels long before people came to expect huge American-style room spaces.
