It is well situated for easy access to Como etc, but the surroundings seems more industrial at first. Eventually, I discovered that there were gardens together with the swimming pool across the access road. I hadn't realised that this was part of the Grand Hotel. The pool area is lovely with comfortable sunbeds and an extremely professional and attentive pool attendant. The hotel itself appears, at first glance, to be very modern and comfortable. Unfortunately the seating both in the bar area and outside were most uncomfortable. Maybe if I were 6ft 6\" I may have been able to sit in the bar area. The fact that the tables were only 6\" off the floor didn't help. The staff found it difficult to serve drinks of any kind and I was fearful of having hot water tipped on me whilst the waiter tried to place cups etc onto the low tables. As we were a coach party, we were served with a welcome drink immediately as we entered the reception to book in. Although appreciated it would have bee better had this waited until we had booked in. The service in the restaurtant at dinner was abominable. The waiting staff were slow and the food although very tasty was never hot. This I put down to lack of staff. One evening we waited three quarters of an hour for our first course. Our tour manager did complain several times and asked for the dinner times to be staggered (there was another coach party as well), but was refused this. There needed to be more staff for the evening meals. Breakfast was self-service and was superb. The prices of drinks was outrageous 10\u20ac for a vodka and 8\u20ac for a bottle of beer. Consequently with the uncomfortable seating and the outrageous prices our evenings were not enjoyable. On a better note, the rooms were large and comfortable. The balcony was disappointing as you could not sit out (too small). The bathroom was spacious.

We had paid extra for a mountain view and while we did indeed see the mountains, we didn't realise that there was an extremely busy road separating them from the hotel. Having said that, we did actually enjoy the hotel. There is a pool in the garden and in addition to the restaurant indoor, there is one in the garden in which we ate each evening. It had a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, the food was good and the hotel was very clean.
