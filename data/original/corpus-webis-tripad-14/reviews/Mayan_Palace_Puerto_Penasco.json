No glimpse of the Sea of Cortez without leaning off the balcony and stretching to look around your building. Stayed here in exchange for a beautiful timeshare in Hawaii through RCI. Flew to Phoenix & rented a car. Can only rent from a few companies if plan to drive across border to Mexico. Must also purchases Mexican liability insurance. Loaded up with groceries in Phoenix--good thing, because nearest store to this resort is 20 miles away. Got to Puerto Penasco after dark; got lost trying to find resort. Cell phones (Verizon at least) do not work there. At check in, mobbed by people trying to sell timeshares at this property. Gave us a room in the oldest building, furthest from the lobby, pools, beach, activities. Next to a Mayan Palace building under construction (until at least 2020 according to one employee,) where the worker(s) hammered all day during the week. Room had a view of what looked like a nuclear power plant in the desert. Resort manager would not give us a room with a view of the Cortez Sea, though many available. Said he was saving those for \"owners.\" Many rooms facing ocean stayed empty all week. Could not reach room service b/c phone busy for hours. All employees told to tell guests they were \"100% full,\" though that was not true. That's how they explained everything away.

Overall very nice experience. The food was excellent, we loved the restaurant (buffet was top notch!) and waiters very friendly. Pool cafe also good. Our suite in Building 2 (newer tower) was very spacious, clean and nicely decorated although furniture was showing some wear. Kitchenette basic but good, had microwave, toaster, blender and other basics. Do note: tile floors throughout means all sound carries to your room from the hallway and floors above. I am a light sleeper and would have appreciated something to dampen the sound, as well as dual paned-glass so I didn't hear every service cart that rolled by the window (we were on the third floor.) I will also confirm the king bed in our room was ultra hard, and I like a firm bed... but this was probably hardest bed I'd ever slept on. The beach is awesome, stretches on for miles and you feel like you have it to yourself. Pool was very nice too, enjoyed the poolside beds for lounging and reading when it was warm enough.

No sense of customer service, everything was \"no\", or they would just ignore your request. Check in felt shady: we asked if upgrade to ocean view was possible and the clerk said he would check. Manager was called over, he never looked us in the eye, just stared down at computer screen for two minutes (while he picked our room assignment) and then left. Clerk took over computer again, after about five minutes handed us our room assignment without addressing our request to see if an upgrade was possible. I had to clarify if we were getting an oceanview, and he said no, it was not available. Seemed very insincere and unconcerned. Then we were immediately told to go sit on a sofa in the lobby and wait to meet the concierge, who of course is part of the timeshare sales team and is there to pin you down to an appointment time for their presentation. We were not at all interested and had no intention of spending a morning with their sales team, and still had to spend 20 minutes with this woman. Finally I told her to just call us later in the week to check if we had changed our minds (we didn't). Three times I had to call or approach the front desk staff multiple times to address simple issues: our safe malfuctioned, etc. They would tell you someone was on the way, then when you called back to follow up 40 mins later, there would be an excuse for the delay and they would assure you that NOW someone was really on their way. Not significant but annoying. Check out I felt same attitude from clerk, like he was too cool to care about us. No warmth or sense of customer service, we had to clarify everything and they will do what they want if you don't look things over carefully. We asked to charge everything to our card in pesos because we trust our credit card's conversion more than the hotel. Seemed like their math was always slightly off. Management needs to take a look at customer service training for their front desk team.

Web access, fitness center, cleaning your kitchen upon departure, etc. are all extra fees. The buffet was top notch but was also $28 US for dinner and $18 for breakfast -- in low season. New Year's Eve party was $100 per person for dinner. Much better meal deals available in town, but that is a 25 minute drive so not practical every day. Best advice: bring in your own breakfast and a couple easy meal alternatives. We would do the buffet once a day and did all the other meals in our room or in town.
