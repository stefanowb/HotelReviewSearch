Our room was a quad and very spacious even by American standards. The bathroom was large and very clean. The two owners, Marco and Roberto, are nice and helpful. They made reservations for the Accademia and Uffizi for us before we arrived (that way we avoided the long lines). Upon arriving they offered us a cold beverage from their well stocked refrigerator by the front desk. They gave us delicious and reasonably priced food recommendations-which we took them up on. They took time to go over the map of Florence and answered any questions we had. They even called the Mail Boxes Etc. to help us ship the great shopping deals we got from the outdoor market (which got us a 10% discount by them calling ahead).", "title": "Very Comfortable Stay!", "user": "hbca04", "date": "August 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 18590852, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 attentive service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "The breakfast was tasty and filling.
