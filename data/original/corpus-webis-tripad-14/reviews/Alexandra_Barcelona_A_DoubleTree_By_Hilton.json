The hotel is pretty decent, nothing special really. When we were there there was a cosntruction going on in the lobby. Not that it bothered us too much, the workers would separate the working zone from the rest of the lobby with some kind of drapes, but still you could hear the hammer and drill and etc. You would think why couldn't they choose the lower season for this, and not the one when there are thousands of tourists in town. The room was ok, always very clean, plenty of toiletries. The hotel is about 15 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya, but you can quite entertain yourself visiting designer shops on your way to the center, so with all the shopping it's not gonna seem that long. And of course it's close to different attractions, and Bus Touristic stops. There is no bathtub in the bathroom, just the shower. We had breakfast at the hotel, it was quite good, the same every morning, but plenty of variety (in my opinion): several kinds of cold meat, cheese, cerial, bacon, srambled eggs, fruits, juice, pastries. Price of breakfast was included in the room rate, but usually it costs 17 euros, quite expensive, considering tons of restaurants in the area where you can have breakfast for twice as cheap, an starbucks around the corner. We used room service once on arrival, the food was brougt to our room really quickly, in about 10 minutes, but tasted pretty average.
