It has the feel of a family run hotel. Our room was very charming with a white wardrobe and headboard. The light was a small chandelier. The room was a good size. The bathroom was adequate and had a nice strong shower with hot water. We were there in mid June and the weather was a bit chilly and rainy. That worked in our favor because there is no air conditioning. A week later, Europe was having a heat wave and I think that our room would have been very hot. Because we slept with the windows open, it was quite noisy. I used ear plugs but my husband did not and heard the noise from the street. The breakfast buffet had scrambled eggs, fresh fruit and fruit salad ( sometimes fresh and sometimes with added canned fruit cocktail), pastries, and cereals. The morning we were leaving we tried to get a taxi to take us to the train. We were assured there were always taxis available. There were none that morning. But they called a cab for us and there was one there in a matter of minutes.", "user": "CorinneSouthbury_CT", "date": "July 4, 2012", "id": 133474498}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived by train,had no trouble finding the hotel via subway.", "title": "Great location but-----.........", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "frances008", "date": "June 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133066458}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Staff very polite, friendly and helpful.
