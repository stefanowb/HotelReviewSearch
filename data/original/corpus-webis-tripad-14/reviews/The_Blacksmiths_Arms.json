We were shown up to the room which we found spacious by comparison with other B&Bs on this trip, and for the first time we had a spacious bathroom, with a bath rather than just a shower. The room was well appointed and we had no trouble with the Sky card, but found it surprising that with so many Sky channels on offer, this a pub without any sports channels! (We had hoped to watch a replay of the All Blacks game from that morning). The bed was supremely comfortable and both of us had the best sleep - great! Breakfast was average, and would have benefitted from the use of fresh summer fruit eg perhaps a fruit salad rather than the sole fruit option of a half-grapefruit - but the home made bread toast was very good.", "title": "Best sleep this tour - recommended!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "littlefmrt", "date": "August 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 74334354}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had the Firle room which is a good size.
