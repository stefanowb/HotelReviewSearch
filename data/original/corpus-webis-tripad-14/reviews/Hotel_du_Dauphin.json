We learned to book rooms with twin beds in Eurpoe as the rooms tend to be bigger. The hotel is beautiful from the outside and is right across from the church. There was a market right outside of our window on Saturday morning, so fun !! The streets are cobblestone and the area is so beautiful. Free parking in a lot a short walk from town, great seaside bay for walks and so many beautiful photos. Bakery around the corner for our morning croissant , or the hotel has a lovely breakfast with tea/coffee, eggs, cereal, coffee cake, ffresh fruit salad, toast, cheese, for 9 euros. Best breakfast we saw in the hotels we stayed in. The staff was the best yet. They were eager to please and went above and beyond for us . They truly made our stay memorable.
