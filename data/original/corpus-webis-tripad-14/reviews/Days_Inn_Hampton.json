Also the carpet was so dirty our feet/socks were practically black! On a positive note we found the micro and fridge a convenience, they do offer a continental breakfast and the staff was pleasant enough. Would stay somewhere else next time though for about the same price...Extended Stay.

The carpet was dirty, the walls were dirty, the room had an odor and the bedding looked old and unclean. There was no matress cover, just a thin sheet on one bed. The pillows had stains and were so bad that I went to Target just up the street and bought new pillows to sleep on. Then there were the late night parties in the parking lot. The first night of our 2 night stay we had to call the front desk because at 2 AM someone was blasting music from the jumbo speakers in the trunk of their car and partying in the parking lot. I could not believe this was allowed to go on where people were trying to sleep! I will never stay there again. There were so many hotels in the area that you would think they would be a little more competitive but I guess they are the least expensive and don't have problems getting business because of the price, but I would rather pay extra for a clean, comfortable room.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 28, 2006", "id": 5407061}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Cheap--unsafe--terrible", "text": "Constant trouble with access to rooms-had to go to desk frequently after attempted entries---overheard cleaning staffer say \"they can't afford to fix system\"--and----Desk gave permission for us to take breakfast tray to room of ill 87 year old with us but we were literally screamed at by some jerk who kept saying he would not allow it!!!
