It is a historic hotel in a nice residential neighborhood, near restaurants, and away from the I-8 (Mission Valley) where a lot of the motels are or downtown where parking is impossible or very expensive. Nevertheless, freeway access is close by. The price was moderate for a small but comfy room with a large bathroom, plenty of electrical outlets, and flat screen TV. It's not luxurious, but it is worth the money. I would recommend it to anyone not interested in a motel and not willing to overpay for the downtown hotels.", "title": "A San Diego classic", "user": "Massimo1", "date": "April 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 128497474}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "It was just remodeled - very nicely done.

This was the first time we decided to stay overnight in a hotel and picked this hotel because it's about 5 minutes from the zoo and the pool was designed by the original \"Tarzan\". We had learned about him from an LA tour we had taken the day before so I thought that was a nice coincidence. We loved the hotel. The food and atmosphere at the Red Fox was totally old school. Steak, baked potatoes, salad...fantastic! The room was recently renovated and was cozy for all 5 of us. The pool was clean and well kept. The breakfast at the newly renovated restaurant off the hotel lobby was fresh and very tasty.
