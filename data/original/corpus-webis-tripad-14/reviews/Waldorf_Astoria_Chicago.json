Everyone everywhere made us feel welcome and appreciated. Our room was exceptionally clean and beautiful, with every amenity at your fingertips. We especially loved the dressing area with two closets, and the huge wet bar with assortment of drinks and snacks. Room service each morning for breakfast was fast and delicious - our favorites were the fruit plate and eggs benedict. We also ordered room service the night we arrived, we were tired and hungry from driving, and the food was cooked to perfection and arrived quickly. We enjoyed drinks and appetizers in the hotel lounge, which was intimate yet inviting. We didn't have an opportunity to visit the spa, but the hotel elevator stopped on that floor a few times, and each time I peeked inside and wished I had time to book a service during our stay!

We stayed Wednesday through Saturday and had an amazing time! We used the CTA to get from the airport to our hotel which was cost effective, but sort of a struggle with our luggage. We arrived to the hotel Wednesday afternoon and were greeted by the most amazing staff! We had booked a king suite and were immediate upgraded to a one bedroom suite. The hotel was jaw dropping! We never wanted to leave our room. Our favorite aspects of the room was the fireplace in the room, the bathroom (equipped with a TV in the mirror) and the super comfortable bed. Now to the staff, Edward, the concierge was amazing! He recommended the most amazing restaurants and went out of his way to help us with anything we needed. Thanks Edward! Spa and gym access was included daily and the amenities were just as astounding as the rest of the hotel. During our four days at the hotel, we encountered the nicest staff we have ever come across.

To be fair, there was a lot about it that was very nice. We were assigned a personal concierge, Andrew, who worked very hard to get us everything we requested. He went above and beyond and made sure that ww had everything that we asked for. The rest of the service at the Waldorf Astoria did not live up to the standard he set. For instance, he offered us a delivery of complimentary French press coffee every morning. A nice touch but on the first morning we were delivered regular coffee and charged for it. After pointing that out, the charge was removed from the bill. However, the next morning, we were delivered French press coffee for one person. The third morning, we didn't get any coffee until we called after waiting one half hour past the scheduled delivery time. They sent up regular coffee and were going to charge us again. In short, they turned a very nice gesture into an irritation by poor execution. It was the same with inconsistent housekeeping services, bar stocking services and spa services. While our room was beautiful, there were areas where our carpet was noticeably stained. The bed, while comfortable, had really scratchy sheets which upon request were switched out leaving one to wonder why not just use the good sheets to start with in the gold coast suite. To be clear, these are obviously small things, but it's details like this that separate hotels of this ranking and price.
