Brilliant location for seeing Sydney - right opposite Milsons Point railway station, only a few miinutes over the Harbour Bridge to the center of Sydney & all ferries, trains etc. Also close to the ferry stop which takes you to Darling Harbour (near the Olympic pool, not that well sign-posted) A very smart, modern hotel with great rooms. The higher up you are the better the views over the bays. Great rooftop pool too. Slightly worrying for older guests in our party - in their 70's they were told on check-in (as we were) that they needed to leave a credit card as deposit \"in case they trashed the room!!\" Also staff were not very accomodating of my friend who was leaving from there for her wedding & would not let her have her room one minute early!", "title": "Good Viibes", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hazelha", "date": "January 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 12362120, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Smart, modern, great views & good location", "disliked": "\u2014 Snooty check-in staff who thought everyone would trash their room!"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled solo", "text": "The suites on the top floors are much bigger, but the bathrooms are actually smaller than in the cheaper rooms.

Views are great, location is excellent, opposite Milson's Point train station and 5 minutes to the city on the train. I also stayed at the hotel when it was \"The Duxton\" and I think the decor and service were better then. We had a problem with parking, but fluked the last park quite luckily, it was a Saturday night. Breakfast was ok, service was ok. The staff were nothing to rave about as far as service goes - the staff were quiet rude to me and some of the rest of our family - and did not go out of their own way to assist either at reception or at breakfast. The decor is quite tired although the website says it was renovated in 2004. Reception and restaurant are funky but rooms are a bit dated. But the views make up for it. Average sized rooms, average sized bathrooms.

The room and furnishings were very clean. The staff was extremely helpful and polite. Parking was available in the building for this year's visit. The location is excellent, even if you are not planning to participate in the events, as it is about 200 metres from the Milsons Point Railway Station, 400 metres from Sydney Harbour, 200 metres from the Harbour Bridge and relatively peaceful.

After leaving our bags there and checking in (but not into the room) earlier in the day, we arrived later that night to be told we did not have a room and that there was nothing resembling our name in the system. This misunderstanding was overcome by the duty manager (but with some unnecessary rudeness thrown in we thought) but then we ended up being given a key to a room with someone else in it. Not a nice thing to walk in on someone while they are sleeping - and not nice for the sleeping person either I imagine!! After another trip downstairs to reception we got another room key to the real room but this did not work. It took even more trips up and down the lift for this to be sorted out and by this stage we were both getting very annoyed at both the service we had been given and the general rudeness and bad attitudes that we were encountering. We realise that we were not acting the angels by this stage either but the way we were treated was totally uncalled for. Eventually, we had to call the groom to come to the hotel from the other side of the city and sort it out for us as we had both become quite upset after all these hassles.

Loved walking around Lavendar and Kirribilli Bay. Staff were very helpful at reception. A bonus arriving in Sydney early morning (our original plan was to drop off the luggage) but the staff said that our room was ready and we could check in at 9.30am! Vibe's marketing material highlights a crisp and clean upmarket hotel. The upgrade is great but it shows a little wear and tear already. I was surprised that management did not notice this when they check rooms. It wasn't as fresh, new and sparkly as I had hoped for compared with the promtional material on the web and brochures. It's amazing what a professional photographer can do. Overall, after staying 2 nights in a Aqua View room I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs an excellent location and it is pretty good value. A bit of a difference compared to staying in a 5 star hotel. But you can save quite a bit of money when booking online or take up the specials.
