The next morning when we went to get it they couldn't find it!!! They acted like we were a burden and were not friendly or apologetic at all! There were dirty towels on the bathroom floor when we arrived, the heater didnt work, the bed was \"damp\" we had to sleep on top of the blankets we brought so we didn't feel like we were laying in a wet bed, and there was sand everywhere and on everything. Now I expect a cheap room in a great location like this to be serviceable at best but it seemed like the previous people checked out and housekeepin did nothing but make the beds and empty the trash. Room was next to alley that was full of overflowing dumpsters, the pool wasn't heated and it was hard to find parking... We love Pacific Beach but couldn't wait to get out of this place.
