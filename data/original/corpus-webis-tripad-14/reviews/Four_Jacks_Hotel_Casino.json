A cozy onsite casino, just right for the size of the establishment, you won't feel lost in the glitz like the Big Name Place down the street. The gaming definitely felt more generous, I didn't feel taken advantage of to pay for all the high-end overhead. The on-site restaurant is a treasure, they pride themselves for their \"from scratch\" cooking, and I believe it. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with the biscuits and gravy! Jackpot is small, there are good sidewalks on each side of the road, and unless it's a howling blizzard, it's not a long walk to visit any or all of the town's other establishments.

On a budget, to boot. There's Twin Falls. There's Wells, NV. Or you could do the Utah route on I-15. How about Jackpot! Except that for the budget minded, the two major casinos are pricey. Four Jacks offers a bargain price alternative. At less than $40 for a double, you get a really clean unit in an old fashioned hotel with lots of charm. A lot of folks have discovered it, as the parking lot by evening was pretty full, mostly older autos and a fair number of motorcycles. They even throw in a 25 cent brew at the bar. The restaurant is so-so. We had rib-eyes at a reasonable price. They were well-seasoned but kind of tough. There were lots of Mexican items on the menu. They might have been much better. However, we would suggest to management that the kitchen get a close look. Otherwise, customers might just go a few blocks north to the premier casinos for their meal. The casino side \"invited\" us to drop a few bucks on the slots, which we dutifully did. However, next morning we traveled south to Wells for breakfast at the casino on the left just before you cross under the Interstate.
