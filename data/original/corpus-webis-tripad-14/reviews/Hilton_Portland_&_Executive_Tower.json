Location of the hotel is excellent - close to restaurants, shopping, and sights. There's been quite a few negative reviews I've noticed, so not sure if that's because people are staying in the old tower, or if the hotel has gone downhill since we last stayed here. IWe enjoyed our stay though. In general however, I find the Hilton chain to be unreliable - they tend to just buy old hotels and partially refurbish them.
