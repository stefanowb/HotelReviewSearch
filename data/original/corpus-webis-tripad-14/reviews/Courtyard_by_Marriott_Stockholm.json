The Stockholm Marriott is a great hotel - large rooms with panoramic views of the City, modern bathrooms with power showers and lovely robes and slippers, huge beds, great breakfast with a wide variety of options, polite and helpful staff, very well equipped gym and a very decent restaurant (Bjork Bar and Grill - we ate there a couple of times, and it was some of the best food we had in Sweden). There is a 24 hour shop on the ground floor which sells snacks and essentials, and free 24 hour internet on the 3rd floor. There are also welcome extras like being able to store your luggage at the hotel if you take an overnight trip out of Stockholm. The only possible downside about the hotel is that it isn't in the city centre. However, having researched this fully before booking this hotel, this means that you get nigh-on 5 star hotel quality for half the price you would pay in the city centre. Also, the walk along Lake Malern into Gamla Stan (about 20 mins) is very pleasant, and we did this every day during our stay. It is also easy to get the bus back if you've had too much walking for one day, or the T-bana as both stop within 5 minutes walk of the hotel. If we ever go back to Stockholm, it will be to this hotel, and will be recommending it to anyone that mentions the possibility of a trip to Stockholm.", "title": "Fantastic hotel", "user": "I_love_globetrotting", "date": "August 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 75929609}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Probably best Courtyard I've ever stayed.
