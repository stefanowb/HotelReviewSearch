The rate is currently $117 for double room or $234 for set of connecting rooms on their website. This is great value for Singapore. The rooms are fairly small (similar size to Traders) as are the bathrooms, but clean enough for a 3 star hotel, it doesnt pretend to be 5 star. We had 3 adults and 2 kids in 2 rooms.Ours also had a fridge, safe, tv hairdryer, internet etc. Its a 5 minute walk to Clarke Quay, with lots of pubs, clubs and restaurants, great for a daytime or evening stroll. They have even developed Robertson Quay itself into a mini Clarke Quay with bars and restaurants on your doorstep. The hotel also has its own bar with deck chairs next to the river and a daily happy hour. Breakfast was basic compared to big hotels, but had coffee, tea, juice, cereals, sausages, beans and eggs, plenty for us and tasted good. Has a small pool with slide going in it, adequate for kids and adults to cool off in.", "title": "Good value for Singapore & great location, with pre-bookable connecting rooms!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "LucyKualaLumpur", "date": "June 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8005270, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Rooms quite small"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Good value for Singapore and much cheaper than getting 2 rooms in a bigger 4 or 5 star hotel.", "title": "It's No Luxury but Good Value for Money", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "RaisenFrau", "date": "June 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7969370, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Hospitality from Hotel Staff"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was there with my family (husband and parents) for holidays 4 days.", "title": "dont go!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "aberdeen01", "date": "May 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 7632044, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the price was the only good bit", "disliked": "\u2014 dirty"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The location is excellent since we had a good view of the Singapore River and part of the Singapore skyline.
