(Amazing paved trails around there - best cycling I've ever done!)Everything in Niagara on the Lake was fully booked, so we stayed in Niagara Falls. One warning for cyclists: this hotel won't let you take bikes on the elevator or to your room. But they do have a small housekeeping storage room near the front desk where we were able to leave our bikes. It might be able to accommodate six bikes. The bedroom was comfortable, the view quite nice (though you can't see anything if you're in the bed or the whirlpool tub!). We used the indoor pool (we saw two pools next to each other - one was for adults only); the sauna, hot tub and of course the in-room whirlpool tube. All were in good condition. On the minus side: The shower is the smallest shower I've ever seen - I kept knocking the door open with my elbow. We had breakfast at Buchanan's one morning but I wouldn't recommend it. It's a very plain, boring buffet and extremely overpriced (over $40 for two!), and their coffee sucks! So we went somewhere else the next morning. Apart from that, everything else was fine - clean, tasteful, quiet, and the staff was pleasant. We walked to restaurants, bars & attractions, all very close.", "title": "High quality, convenient", "user": "BibiOntario", "date": "September 24, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 80889078}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I enjoyed this hotel but the rooms were lacking in amenities (not enough coffee and creamer) and the service was average.

The staff was on their game and the accomodations were excellent. We had a king suite on the 11th floor and it was extremely comfortable. The pool and hot tub was great and the hotel architecture has the feel of a Colorado ski resort. The location is great, between the honky tonk arcade and junk shops to the north and the casino to the south. The falls was not a bad walk and the weather was great.

It is far from a terrible hotel but for the money compared to others in the area that I have stayed at it fell short. We were having a romantic night away from the kids and originally wanted a smoking whirlpool room but there were none available ( not the hotels fault obviously) so we decided to book a regular smoking room. That was a mistake( should have just taken a non-smoking whirlpool) avoid the smoking rooms on the 7th floor at all costs! These rooms share a community balcony, which means any guest in these rooms can walk the entire length of the balcony. Which means that if you do not have your blackout curtains drawn then they can see into your room! Could not allow natural light into the room or leave the drapes open and enjoy any view because trying to enjoy a romantic get away we did not need a stranger strolling by at anytime and being able to see into the room. This balcony is a very poor design ( I am in construction and have supplied materials to some of the new hotels and buildings in Niagara Falls and am familiar with their layouts and design) and there should be a railing or wall of some sort seperating each rooms section of the balcony. It was not too romantic to keep the blackout drapes drawn the entire time and still hear people right outside your room on the balcony while you are hoping to enjoy some private times. Not to mention it is a security issue, you do not need your room key to get in and out of the balcony doors and I understand if you leave your key in the room you would be locked out, but I did not see any security cameras covering this area and if you forget to lock that door it provides easy private access into your room not to mention anyone with any skill could gain entry from this private location (If I was the type of person now being familiar with the layout I could book a room in this area and know I have easy access to the others along this balcony) should definately be addressed . We stay in Niagara Falls about 3 times a year between a couple of romantic getaways and an occasional family getaway and feel that for the price there are better options. The condition of the public areas are good and the staff was friendly, I also have nothing but good things to say about the spa ( we enjoyed a wonderful couples massage during our stay). Unfortunately the rooms are no more than your everyday run of the mill room, for similar money there are hotels in the area with better views and the rooms are a bit more impressive or you can get a similar room for less around the city. Can be close to a premier hotel in Niagara but has some simple items to address, but unfortunately these simple items can be enough to turn a guest off.", "title": "Disappointed, didn't live up to the reviews I read online", "user": "CanadianCB", "date": "September 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 81284810}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "First time in Niagara Falls, Ontario and would recommend Doubletree Fallsview Hotel.
