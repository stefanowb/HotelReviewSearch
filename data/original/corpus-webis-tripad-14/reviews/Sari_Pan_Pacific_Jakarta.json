The pool was lovely, however. Reception staff were friendly, albeit not used to seeing a tourist with a backpack, however the Irish pub was devoid of customers, staff liked to chat rather than serve. The room was average, but clean and as expected. Toiletries provided were okay, but not luxury, which is something that makes or breaks it for me. Bathroom was average. Complimentary breakfast was okay, and the helpful staff let me stay in the business lounge to watch TV after checking out time, whilst waiting for the free shuttle taxi to the airport. Overall, good for business people, or people staying for a few days in the city untill moving on.", "user": "wanderingbedu", "date": "February 10, 2008", "id": 13440095}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled on business", "text": "My mom and step father recommended us to stay at Sari Pan with them as they had stayed at Sari Pan couple times before. I can certainly see why they always come back here. We all stayed at Sari Pan between 29 Dec '07 and out on 3 Jan '08 and had 3 rooms and loved it. It was my husband first time to Jakarta and he was very impressed of the great service and facilities. I am suprised how highly he talked about Jakarta and all this because Sari Pan has made good impression on him from the moment we stepped into the lobby. Our 17 months old son also had a great time running up and down the hallways and the lobby. Breakfast on the pacific floor was devine, the view was great. It was almost as if we were dreaming it all. However, room service was insanely expensive since you can get the same thing down the street for 4 times cheaper and tastier. We stayed in the Pacific room on the 17th floor and that was great because it has cooking facility, huge bathroom and a living room. I would definately recommen anyone to stay at Sari Pan Pacific for the great location. Don't look any further. Stay at Sari Pan Pacific for the great service, great facilities and the fact it's close to the shopping malls, clubs and many more... We already made plan to come back to Jakarta and stay at Sari Pan towards the end of 2009. Hopefully the service will stay the same as in 2009 we will be staying longer.", "title": "We will be back!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MRXJVicary", "date": "January 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12875297, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Expensive room service menu"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled on business", "text": "An above average hotel but definitely not a typical Pan Pacific hotel. great location too as it is close to the CBD as well as shopping malls.", "title": "Good location and expensive internet", "user": "The_TravellerSg", "date": "November 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10839111}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Adequate facilities in the hotel such as gym and the pool.
