My friend had a teeny portion of very fatty duck with a huge helping of mash. I had very strange combination of soggy deepfried monk fish swimming on a sea of drowned noodles with only big chunks of rawish peppers for company. My desert of shortbread, peaches, cream and fruit sauce was beautiful. Friend stuck to the cheeseboard and did complain about the quality of the duck. This was well handled with her cheeseboard being removed from the bill.
