Look no further- you found it! We booked a one bedroom suite, which contained one double bed in bedroom and one comfortable pull out couch in living room/kitchen. We knew that the bed would not be a \"queen\" as advertised on the website. It has been our experience that most extended stay hotels call a double bed a queen. The room was spotless and very inviting. The staff could not have been more helpful and hospitable. Large table, kitchen with microwave and full size refrigerator. Cabinets contained pots, pans, utensils, flatware, plates, bowls, etc. The view from our room was nothing short of spectacular- the Empire State Building and the Hudson River. Two TV sets, and one VCR, and a video library in the lobby.", "user": "tonyraisins", "date": "August 2, 2006", "id": 5543171}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved the location", "text": "The hotel is a 10 minute -very safe - walk from the Pavonia/Newport PATH station. You'll pass one or two restaurants, two other hotels, condos and parking lots. If you choose, there is a light rail train that stops opposite the hotel, which can wisk you to the PATH station, as well as other Jersey points in a jiffy. Check out Hoboken for great shopping and night life. The PATH trains run all night, connecting you to six stations in Manhattan. There is a large shopping mall nearby. The parking is free and convenient. The hotel contains a 24 hour comissary, with items sold on the honor system. A large laundry room provides free washers and dryers. The hotel also runs a limited hour and area shuttle a few times a day. If you are arriving from NEWARK Airport, take the shuttle bus to Newark\u2019s Penn Station, and jump on the PATH.

The staff at the hotel were courteous and knowledgable. Jersey City itself isn't the nicest city around, but the area where the hotel is located is extremely safe and well-lit.
