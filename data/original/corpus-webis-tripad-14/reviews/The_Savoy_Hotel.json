The hotel overlooks lawns, which run down to a line of trees with a view of the sea in the distance. The West cliff is just a 2 min walk from the hotel and overlooks the beautiful golden sands. The interior of the hotel is very well decorated, clean with very large,comfortable, seating areas. The dining room is set out with, mainly, tables for 2, and the young staff are very efficient and friendly. We were given room 15, which is on the ground floor alongside the car park. It was quite large and designed for guests with mobility problems, very nicely furnished and very clean, also very warm and quiet. The only downside as far as the hotel was concerned was the evening meal which was not to our liking - no roasts and no salads were on offer. As to the Shearings itinery, Salisbury is a quite unremarkable town and the Cathedral was too far away from the coach park for people with limited mobility to visit. Southampton was a complete waste of time unless you just wanted shops, we never saw a ship as the docks were too far away and we had 4 hrs to 'kill' there. Shearings also offered 2 other optional outings at a cost of \u00a38.50 per person - one to Dorchester and the other a tour around Bournemouth,Sandbanks and Poole. Not enough passengers took up the tour so it was cancelled. Most of the passengers on our coach used the local buses to visit the coastal towns around Bournemouth , So, to sum up, I can recommend the hotel, but would point out the anomolie s in the Shearings excursions to passengers with mobility problems.", "title": "Perfect seafront position of this Hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "721Freya", "date": "October 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143035870}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012", "text": "Great Hotel for value - very near to the centre of Bournemouth and Beaches.
