We generally book Junior suites and have hit quite a few in our sun holidays abroad. This was the best of them. The Junior suite was huge and very tastefully furnished. There was a main bathroom off the main bedroom and a shower room off the living quarters where the children slept. The hotel was excellent. It was very large and did not feel in any way crowded but the service was excellent and the staff very nice and friendly. The food was varied and the buffet was extensive. The spa looked fab. and overlooked the sea.
