It is perfect for independent travelers and is not very expensive for Ushuaia if you are looking for comfort. It's a relatively easy 10 minute walk up the hill from Av. San Martin, the main street with most of the shops and restaurants. I had asked for a room with a shared bathroom, but was upgraded to a fully private room on my arrival. Mine had a queen and single bed in it. Overkill for a solo traveler, but I am not complaining. I loved my room. It was spacious and felt like a real bedroom. The wood paneling and exposed beams were really charming and fit the style of the place. The bed and pillows were perfect for me and I appreciated having a nice side-chair for sitting and reading or watching TV. In the shower, the hot water was plentiful. The rest of the posada was so homey and was attractively furnished and decorated, like a country lodge. From the top floor, which has the common rooms for eating, sitting, and meeting the other guests, you have wonderful views and can see the mountains (not easy to miss) and the a bit of the Beagle Channel. Breakfast was good, with eggs to order. Travelers should be aware that this is an inn, so there is no elevator. Also, consider bringing slippers, especially if it is winter, because the bedroom floors are uncovered tile. I never saw the cat, but the dog was a typically friendly and delightful chocolate lab. Thanks to Ana for making such a warm , peaceful, and aesthetically appealing envrionment and thanks to her and to Marcelo for taking such good care of me and helping with my tourism and other needs.", "title": "What can I say?
