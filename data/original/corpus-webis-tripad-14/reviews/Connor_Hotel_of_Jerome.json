Yes, you could hear the music from the bar downstairs -- but it isn't like its a shock or surprise, you know it is there before you book if you read anything. I chose the place because my last name happens to be Connor and I couldn't resist. I really liked it tho and would probably have chosen it even with a different name. The room was quaint, comfortable and clean. Not too small tho space was fairly limited. The view, well the view from room 10 is basically a roof-atrium. You can see walls and pipes. Price was right. Parking may be a challenge, I got lucky and got a space right across the street. As for the haunting, I didn't notice anything but then I'm not afraid of ghosts and the supernatural so maybe they left me alone as being no fun!", "title": "Loved this place!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MyWorldatPeace", "date": "April 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7278661, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Its character!", "disliked": "\u2014 No elevator - hauling luggage upstairs was not terribly fun, tho I'm sure someone would have helped if I'd asked."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Check this place out if you like small, cozy and comfortable places with lots of character!", "title": "Awesome stay!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MM72", "date": "March 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7155753}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Experience", "text": "My wife and I and our two young children stayed here on the 11th and I must admit, I was quite impressed with the room! We stayed in room 6, which had 2 queen beds and was very spacious. I was most impressed with the size of the bathroom, but for its size, the shower could have been a bit larger. Also the air had not been turned on yet for the season and during the day it's really warm in the bedroom. Don't plan on sleeping in the next morning...we were awakened at 7:30 by the garbage trucks just below us emptying all the bins, and all the bikers were leaving town. We saw no ghosts either. I look forward to staying here again - after I recouperate from the long drive from Tucson!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TexasZuggie", "date": "March 8, 2007", "id": 6933033}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Jerome"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 4, "very good": 31, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 76}, "aka": "Connor Hotel Jerome", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Comfortably restored historic hotel in the heart of Jerome.
