The staff barely spoke English but tried to be helpful and there was only a street map available- not one brochure, tour guides, tourist information of any sort. I was given the name of a tour operator who offered only \"personall\" tours at $250 US as there \"are no tours in Izmir at this time\"!! I got in taxi to the Hliton hotel and made bookings from there for daily tours to Ephesus /Pergamonfor only 65 euro!!!The rooms were tidy and there was a table and 2 chairs but the single beds were vv hard. The fridge was barely cold and so bar lukewarm and no good for keeping own drinks in. The windows were double glazed and noise hardly discernible and the aircon was fine .There is a nice lobby and a hamman which I didn't try and a nice bar but v basic, expensive dining room which I used one night. Seemed to be lots of turkish people staying there, some tour groups but really very few tourists like me.", "title": "Aksan no stars", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "GiniCarr", "date": "June 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 5328912}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "The breakfast was buffet style and very wide and good selection .Taxi to the Hilton and waterfront was only 3.5 lira but the walk from the elegant shops and waterfront was a good 40 min!!I was in a room next to the lift which was vv noisy though I always travel with earplugs to sleep.

Others might want to avoid this hotel because it is not up to date in its decor and that it's in an incredibly grubby area. If you do stay in this part of Izmir, I caution all women to wear very modest apparel because even long shorts and a t-shirt will be gawked at by every single man on the street. Perhaps this is true throughout Izmir -- we chose not to explore after this experience unlike te rest of our time in this country. The only women we saw nearby belonged to the strip clubs down the street. Again, DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL. Oh yeah, and the air conditioner was weak.", "user": "Zeno G", "date": "October 12, 2007", "id": 10070079}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007", "text": "Unfortunately i booked a room from this hotel.
