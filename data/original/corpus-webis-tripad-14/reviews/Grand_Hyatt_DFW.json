I would not consider this a luxury hotel; it is a lovely respite from the burdens of travel. The hotel and rooms are attractive, modern, clean and quiet.

The shower head is oddly pointed at the door, so please do not make the mistake of turning on the water without either moving the shower head or getting in first. Also, the size of the shower makes shaving an acrobatic act. The pictures on the website and tripadvisor are accurate and speak fairly for themselves. The staff can be cool. Floor 4 is 1/2 smoking and 1/2 non-smoking, therefore, I recommend non-smokers avoid. Also, watch the rates on the Hyatt website; the rates can fluctuate quite a bit and if you secure a lower rate be sure to request an email confirmation as the hotel does not appear to get the revised rate. Upon each visit I had to show my blackberry to convince the hotel staff that I did indeed negotiate a lower rate. More work for the travel weary.

Love that the hotel is attached to the terminal building, so there is no need to go outside once you're in the airport. One of the first things that struck me about the room was how nice it smelled: like freshly laundered clothes. It was so comforting! The room itself was lovely. The furnishings were new, tasteful and modern, and the bathroom was enormous. It had a huge tub and a separate shower. The room was a pretty big with a large TV and a window that covered the entire wall. We had been told that the view from this room wasn't good, but I disagree. It's quite hard to describe, but it was kind of like looking out on the Millennium dome in London, but actually FROM the dome. We were obviously looking out at the roof of the building below, but it seemed quite futuristic. Certainly not something I would want to look on everyday, but it was really quite interesting for an overnight, and the window comes with an automatic shade that blocks the whole thing out. Anyway, who cares about the view at an airport, right? The rate included breakfast which I highly recommend getting because they allow you to use this credit for room service and it was a lot of food. I had the mushroom and onion omelet and my husband had the egg white, both came with toast, and both were excellent. We also got a pot of coffee each (listed as 'small' on the menu, but I must have had 3 cups and didn't even finish it) and two large glasses of juice. I also really appreciated the thoughtful inclusion of a yoga mat in the closet which I would loved to have used if I had not been so pressed for time. Actually, I'd have liked to have stayed an extra night as this hotel was such a welcome change from any other airport hotel.
