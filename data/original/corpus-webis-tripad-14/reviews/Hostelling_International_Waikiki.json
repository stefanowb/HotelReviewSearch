I almost was considering sleeping at the airport (it was very difficult to dial into Waikiki because all the phone lines were tied up, plus the hotel I stayed at the previous night was very expensive and not in my \"emergency\" budget) until I remembered that one of the travel guides I had read mentioned a hostel in Waikiki, so I called them directly and they had beds available. When we arrived, it was almost pitch black, because of the power outtages. The desk attendant checked us in promptly even without electricity. (They still use the old carbon copy receipt system here.) At first, she offered us dorm-style beds, but then we inquired about a private room and that's what we got. It was a very spartan room, but met our needs (a place to sleep/rest and bathe)-given the situation.There was no air conditioning, but its not too hot in October, so that was no problem (still muggy though). I slept well, though my companion was more paranoid and was afraid that someone was going to break into our room. There were a lot of guests smoking on the terrace outside the room as well. People with mobility issues should not stay here because there is no elevator and the stairwells are rather steep and narrow. The best thing about our stay was the fact that we got a private room and bathroom. I'm not into waiting to take a shower or walking on soggy bath mats. I'm also not into people coming home late at night in the dorms and chit chatting while I'm trying to sleep. And I'm also not into plastic or vinyl lined mattresses either. I'm glad for our Waikiki hostel experience (previously stayed at a very noisy, but more well-kept hostel in Cannes, France) but wouldn't choose to stay at a hostel for more than 2 days. Plus, its not that great of a value-but staying at a hostel makes one appreciate how nice most hotels are.

You cannot beat the location (3 mins walk from Waikiki beach), price ($23) and friendly staff. If you're going to be out and about all day and just need a place to crash and shower then this is it. If you want bath robes and full frontal ocean view rooms stay across the street at one of the $250+ hotels. I didn't use the kitchen at all but it was clean; same for the dorm room I was in. Building is an old converted apartment building so when you walk into female room # 4 you have the room you're standing in, with three female beds (single and a set of bunk beds). Off the main room is another dorm room with again just a single bed and one set of bunk beds. Finally, also off the main room are two private rooms which house the female staff and of course the shared bathroom is also off the main room. Secure overnight parking available for $5 a night, internet access $1/10min. Island tours leave Mon/Wed & Fri and apparently are well worth it $35 from 10am-8pm ish. Plenty of street noise starting early at approx 6-7am but it didn't really bother me, was up early for breakfast and fun every day anyway.

The location is fantastic, right behind the Hyatt Regency and less than 2 blocks from the beach. No elevators and if you have lots of luggage (like we did) and you get a room on the top floor, it can be a pain. All rooms come en-suite (with private bath) and fan to keep you cool. No towels but the beds have sheets...even though they don't look that clean. The room didn't look dirty but it definitely wasn't clean and one look at the mattress made me want to weep. I have stayed in many hostels in my life and this one was the worst. The pillows we had on the bed were about as flat as a pancake and had to be super old for it to get that flat. After the 2nd night, I complained and said that the pillows were awful and the front desk guy said, \"hey, for $45 in Waikiki, don't expect anything. Lower your expectations.\" He had a point but it was sad that they cannot raise their standards. There were yellow \"do not cross\" tape draped over the corners of the floor because they looked as if they would crumble if anyone got near them. There is undercover secured parking as first come first served. Honestly, if they just got some new sheets and pillows and some paint and cleaned up and charge a little extra, it would be nicer. I honestly would've rather camped then stay here.
