Hotel Aristol is a three star hotel near the Guinardo (yellow line) metro station. I would compare it to a Holiday Inn in terms of the types and quality of rooms.

Very comfortable rooms with good A/C. Didn't really hear any ambulances. There aren't many english channels on the TV, but when you are in Barcelona, TV doesn't really matter. Service was very courteous. Didn't try the breakfast so no comment on that. The hotel is located up the hill from the direction of the sea, so the best metro to get off (if you are not taking a taxi) is also the closest- Guinardo/Hospital de Sant Pau, which happens to be the yellow line. The best walk from the hotel is this- turn right when you walk out of the door, heading downhill on Carrer de Cartagena. Take it until you get to the pedestrian boulevard Avinguda de Gaudi (small cars and motorcycles run on the sides). It runs diagonal to the other streets and begins right across the street from the main entrance to the historical part of Hospital de Sant Pau. You will be able to see a great view of the Sagrada Familia from here and the walkway continues all the way to the church. The street is lined with restaurants and cafes and is a very pleasant walk. FYI, a good grocery store is located right across the street from the hospital on Sant Antoni Maria Claret called Bon Preu. You can get tasty crossaints and sandwiches for good prices there to take to the beach!", "title": "Comfortable with Good Price", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "bdwhite1", "date": "December 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 88900651}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "This is a clean, safe hotel.
