In reality, the cottage was only about 10 or so metres from the gravel road that guests use to get round the property, and when we sat outside, we could clearly hear the conversation of the guests in the cottage next to ours and behind some trees. In addition, there was no outdoor furniture (unlike what is shown on the website) so we had to drag the indoor seats outside to sit on the deck. None of this was a big deal but it just wasn't what I was expecting/hoping for, especially after having viewed the website.
