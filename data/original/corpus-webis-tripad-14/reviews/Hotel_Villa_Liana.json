Stayed at Hotel Liana for 3-day break. The Hotel was quiet, very comfortable, and clean. Room was a little dated in looks but serviceable with T.V - no AC although cold fan to ease August heat (sweltering 32 C). Great gardens to relax in (though plenty of mosquito's - beware! Was bitten lots. All staff warm and friendly. Although location a little remote from centre of Florence buses easily navigatable and 'hop-on hop-off' tourist bus at end of road with ticket valid for full 24 hours.(pay on bus). Came in from Pisa Airport via train to Florence Train Station then taxi from station to Hotel (7 euro's) - walk will take approx 30 mins. Overall opinion - loved Florence - Great Hotel.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "genesta", "date": "August 31, 2003", "id": 1270122}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Liana a good choice", "text": "Hotel Liana is a fifteen minute walk from the Duomo, but the price, the staff and the room made it worth the extra walk with my group of eleven college students. I shared a garden room with twin beds. Lots of light. Nice and quiet, unlike the area in the city with many of the three star and two star hotels. The shower in my room was one of the hand-held European jobs with no shower curtain, but that was survivable and even comical. The showers in some of the other rooms were American style. A note of caution, ask for a room upstairs or in the back, behind the desk. They tried to put some students in a first floor room in the front, but I made a fuss because the room smelled like raw sewage. I know I am not the only one to have complained about this room. I had read a review before I went that mentioned the same problem. Sounds like a problem with city sewage, but the room would not have been bearable. As a result they put four students in a suite instead of two twin rooms. It was not what I wanted, but a minor inconvenience. Simone and Laertes were especially nice hosts.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 25, 2003", "id": 923866}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Just returned from fabulous trip to Tusacny.", "title": "Fabulous florence", "user": "Lu_J", "date": "October 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5942796, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staff very helpful and hotel just 2 minutes walk from park which was brillant for our two small children to run around prior walking to all the sites.", "title": "excellant location with very helpfull staff", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Youngoggy", "date": "October 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5905252, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Traditional Italian Hotel with relaxed atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Car park difficult to find/ not well sign posted"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A great place - depending on which room you're allocated", "text": "Room excellent (downstairs) so easy to get pushcair in and out.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 3, 2004", "id": 2861137}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great atmosphere", "text": "Four beds plus cot and still plenty of room.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 5, 2004", "id": 2418158}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great place to stay!", "text": "Breakfasts were good - but not always clean table ready.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 24, 2004", "id": 1741955}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I just got back from a week in Italy, and received a very pleasant surprise at Hotel Liana.
