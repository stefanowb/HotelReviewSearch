(Both aged 20) It was a cheaper alternative to the others in centre MK and did not cost much by taxi to get to the nightlife. Check in was simple and quick and the room looked just like every other premier inn minus a plasma TV. The hotel was clean and fine, BUT the pub 2 for \u00a310 was AWFUL. I actually refused to pay for meal it was that disgusting. I used to work for Whitbread up until two months ago and i worked in the premier side in head office so i know the standards. The restaurant next door is no way affiliated with premier inn or whitbread 2for \u00a310 is a different chain in its own right, and boy could I tell the difference. We waited 10minutes to be seated even though there was only two tables bein used in the restaurant- the staff were having there own private conversations. We got seated and waited 15minutes for our drinks to arrive and food orders to be taken. An hour after ordering our starter came which i could only describe as heated up iceland \u00a31 buffet selection. The main course came, my boyfriends lasagne was edible but the garlic bread rock hard! my chicken i had to saw like it was a steak, the bacon was bright pink the cheese was jus grated on top and not even melted as a chicken new yorker should be!! AND my chips were stone cold! i sent the food back and just asked for fresh chips as i didn't really feel like eating. Whilst there i heard another two families complain about slow service and another two sent their meals back! I have never ever sent food back or written a review but people need to be warned of this food! I complained to the manager and he just wrote off my bill as it seemed everyone was complaining, and he couldn't really be bothered with an argument! So all in all a good hotel, just a terrible restaurant! AVOID!!", "title": "Great Hotel!

Families on an adjacent table sent theirs back so it wasnt just me. The chicken had the texture and flavour of processed chicken and although breast shape im not convinced it was anywhere near 100% chicken. Desert, when it came was overpriced for the small size of it. Sadly the table opposite neaded a wipe over but this was not done and four separate members of staff tried to seat people at this clearly dirty table. Eventually someone sat there, before realising his mistake. Surely the staff are capable of wiping a clearly dirty table. The saving grace was the Beer that was very well kept.
