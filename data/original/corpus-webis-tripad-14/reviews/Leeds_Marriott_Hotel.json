This was definitely worth the money. The room was lovely and cosy. Visited the spa in the morning and the pool was spotless, as was the jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Overall a lovely stay and very reasonably priced.

Room minuscule, bed like a trampoline and dipped in the middle. Very poor sleep owing to street noise all night, although that is hardly Marriott's fault.
