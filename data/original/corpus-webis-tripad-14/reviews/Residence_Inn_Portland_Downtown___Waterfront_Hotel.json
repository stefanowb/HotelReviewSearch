This hotel was still being finished and was not taking reservations. I booked a room at the Portland Regency. Reading the reviews for the Regency, I was a bit concerned. But it was only 1 night. As we got closer, I noticed the Residence was taking reservations. I wasn't sure about the area, but decided to switch to the Residence Inn. We are so glad we did. The night we came in, there were many storms up and down the East Coast. We left D.C. 3 hours late. It was 3:15AM and pouring rain when we arrived. We were pleasantly greeted and given our room in quick fashion. We even bought some food to munch on since we were starving. Thankfully the store was open. The room was great. Spacious, clean and had everything we needed. We unpacked and fell asleep immediately in the very comfortable bed. The manager offered a late check-out since we got there so late. We took him up on the offer. We weren't able to eat breakfast, but picked up some yogurt, tea, coffee and the paper later. The location is not in the center, but is so close you can walk everywhere. I wish we had the opportunity to stay longer, but were driving up North. We would definitely stay here again!", "title": "So happy we found this hotel!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "L1", "date": "August 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 36729501}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at this brand new hotel last week (they just opened about a week ago).", "title": "Great Hotel!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Luv2Travel35", "date": "July 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35589565}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Portland"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 36, "very good": 170, "terrible": 16, "excellent": 240}, "aka": "Residence Inn Portland", "slim_ranking": 0.294117647059, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Portland, Maine's only all suite hotel is located in the heart of the historic Old Port district.
