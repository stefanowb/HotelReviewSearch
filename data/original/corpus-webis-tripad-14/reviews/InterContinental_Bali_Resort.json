We stayed in the Singarajah wing and were so impressed by the cleanliness of the resort in general, the wonderful staff - so happy to help with anything - and the facilities. We felt safe, comfortable and were regular attendees at the Sunset Bar happy hour. We also had a wonderful beach side bbq at the Sunset Bar. All resort activities are well posted and the 24 hr concierge in our wing was a great resource - as was the genuine interest in your day, complimentary juice/coffee/tea/snacks available whenever you felt like it. Breakfasts were legendary and catered for all nationalities and tastes. At our first breakfast sitting we piled our plates high - eyes much bigger than our bellies!! - by the end of the week we were a little more restrained. Our dinner in the restaurant (can't remember the name - was next to Sunset Bar - was exquisite. Service second to none and food just wonderful. We spent most of our days eating out as the local food is also great but it was a real treat to go to the restaurant. The lobby is very impressive and we felt really special the whole stay.

We didn't feel comfortable in the first room allocated to us because it was on the ground floor, near to the Singaraja lounge. The front-desk immediately checked and offered us another room on the 1st floor, facing the pools, which was much more decent. When the front-desk discovered that my friend's birthday falls on a day during our stay there, they immediately arranged for a cake to be delivered to our room on her birthday. Upon checking-in, we requested a super-glue as the sole of my friend's sandal was coming off. The housekeeping staff appeared within 10 minutes with the super-glue!!!! The housekeeping responded to all our other requests within a reasonable time-frame. And all their staff are courteous and smiley. The only 1 incident that sort of tainted our views slightly is a staff at the Singaraja lounge. I requested that staff to help me make a reservation for massage at Jari Menari. I believe he pretended to call Jari Menari and subsequently dialled the telephone number of another spa. When he put down the phone, he told me that Jari Menari was fully booked for that day and he quickly recommended repeatedly another spa to me, emphasizing that that spa does pick-up from hotel. The speed at which he promoted another spa made me suspicious. When i went back to my room, I called Jari Menari directly and found that they actually have slots for that day!!!

The gym was great and we enjoyed the pool and various food establishments too as the quality of food was excellent. The beach isn't as beautiful as others say it was, maybe we are too spoiled having been to various beaches in Australia, Thailand and others. Nice for the kids for playing in the sand. Service was in general attentive with some annoying lapses, e.g., at breakfast, we had to ask a number of times for coffee. Other things we did not like (for a 5 star): internet cost was approx. US$10 per day per laptop (we had two) whereas in other hotels we stayed at, the cost was per room; we were supposed to get a daily newspaper but did not; rooms did not get tea bags (although the coffee machine was great) and milk for coffee was not consistently replaced by housekeeping; service at the poolside cafe was a bit slow; sending a postcard using their business centre cost a highly-inflated US$1.10 per card.
