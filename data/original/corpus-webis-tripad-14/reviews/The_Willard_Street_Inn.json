I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and they were all right! We stayed in Lindsay's Loft (#15). It is a smallish room on the third floor, but very comfortable with plenty of light and your own private bathroom. The shower was very small, but was fine. The house itself is gorgeous and I loved the gardens out back. We were able to walk into town for dinner/activities during our stay.

Either they were full or we only needed a room/rooms for one night. (The Inn has a 2 night minimum.) I was so excited to finally be able to book the last room The Larkin Suite (Room 10) for my husband, daughter and myself during the very busy 3rd/4th of July holiday. After a long drive we were warmly welcomed and given a quick tour of the downstairs and explained the breakfast seatings. A dining room with coffee, tea, lemonade and cookies was available to help yourself. A downstairs refrigerator was available for guests to store food/drinks or refreeze ice packs for picnics or on the road snacks/meals. It was a spacious (well air conditioned) king bedded suite with a conjoined sitting room and comfy daybed. A small flat screen TV was in the sitting room for my daughter to enjoy, while my husband and I enjoyed relaxing on the super comfy bed with wireless service for our laptops. (There is also a public computer available on the first floor.)The bathroom was quirky yet charming with a slipper tub and small shower. Towels plushy and robes befitting a high end spa. An added bonus was that the city of Burlington celebrates the holiday with fireworks on the 3rd of July on Lake Champlain. We were too exhausted from traveling all day to attend the fireworks, but were able to enjoy them from the air conditioned comfort our room. It's a relatively quiet street so we all had a great nights sleep. We loved the red, white and blue waffles served with fresh fruit 4th of July morning. 2 other options were available, in addition to coffee, juice and a basket of breads and muffins. Took a picnic lunch to North Beach and decided after 3 hours the hotel/room was a much more comfortable option to relax. The Inn is situated within walking distance to a variety of wonderful restaurants. Our other daughter just moved off campus from UVM and the inn is also within walking distance to her apt. Looking forward to returning to the Willard Street Inn in the near future and highly reccommend this inn to all.", "title": "FAMILY FUN OVER THE FOURTH OF JULY HOLIDAY", "user": "MGoose58", "date": "July 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133466939}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just spent 3 days at The Willard Street Inn! The grounds are amazing, the house is gorgeous, the solarium for breakfast is beautiful and the rooms are lovely as well. My husband and I were not at all impressed with the breakfast, however, which was a bummer. We tried each different kind: eggs/savory, sweet (pancakes, waffles, french toast), and their yogurt and granola. The eggs were not prepared well, the granola was much too sweet and the others were just okay. We were also surprised by the showers in the rooms-- gorgeous old rooms with impecable detail and that perfect country feel, but with plastic showers... seemed quite out of place. I think it would be a great investment to put in nicer showers with tile. We stayed in Rose Garden (a room on the third floor) one of the nights and the shower was TINY. I am 5 feet tall and thin and it was hard to move around that shower stall even for me!
