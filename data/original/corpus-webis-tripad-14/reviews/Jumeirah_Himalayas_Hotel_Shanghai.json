Hotel conveniently located in Pudong, only a 20 min ride from the Bund. The architecture and interior design of the building is superb - taking into consideration of chinese culture (trees, clouds & feng shui) and the comfort of a top tier 5 star hotel. Hotel lobby center stage is another piece of antique which feature live Chinese music every evening. On Friday evenings, they even feature belly dance-I guess this may be a Middle east tradition. There are plenty of original antique paintings, calligraphy hanging everywhere you look. Lots of gadgets in the room - everything electronically controlled - blinds and roller blinds.

The hotel is truly a five star experience, from the lobby, to the rooms and the facilities though there are still some minor renovations in progress. I was lucky to be given a suite room which was split by bedroom section and lunge/dining area, fittings were good and the layout is very open plan, only downside is the view (though in this area there is only views of the exhibition centre. Favourite restaurant I tried was the grill room with a good selection of starters and steaks.

The hotel is plush, modern and hi-tech, but there were frequent brief power outages. Unfortunately, when power returned, it caused all room lights to come on when they were previously off at the master switch. This meant during my 1st night, being woken by lights turning on, and twice on the second (at 1 and 3 am). Reports to engineering did not resolve this and I was eventually moved to another room where the problem did not occur, although the air-con did not work properly and the room remained warm all night. Management were helpful and offerred to not charge for one night, but ultimately I would have preffered to have slept well.
