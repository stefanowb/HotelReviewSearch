The hotel was great with a pool for our days not at the park. Room was comfortable. We stayed on 3rd floor rear which was very quiet.

The breakfast served its purpose and gave you you enough choice to be satisfied. Coffee on tap all of the time. The staff were all very helpful and gave good advice. We used the Orlando Ale House right opposite the hotel for most meals. It provided a great choice of food and the drinks were very good value. It was always busy of an evening but not noisy. We used the itrolley buses to get around, we avoided the hire car because with the limited use and the cost to park at Universal it was just not worth it.

We decided on this because it looked to be closer to Universal Studios, our ultimate destination. We're glad - even though the other BW claimed to be 'within walking distance', it would be a looooong walk! The Universal Inn is on a shopping/dining complex with the Fairfield Inn, so it's close to several restaurants, a Starbucks, a Walgreen and a gift shop. We ended up eating at two of the restaurants after long days at Universal, so the location is just ideal. Rooms are clean and very large, with a fridge and a microwave. Breakfast was on par with the other BWs we've stayed at. Staff (front desk, breakfast room personnel, housecleaning) were all very courteous and would actually greet you when you passed by. I only have a couple of comments: 1.the breakfast area is a bit too small, and most likely everyone ate at the same time (so we could all make our 'pilgrimage' to Universal :-> ) But I overheard that they might do some renovation to enlarge the breakfast area, so management was already aware of this need; 2. the noise we usually got was from the slamming of doors when guests went in/out of their rooms. If something can be done, say with the hinges, or patting around the door frame to reduce the noise, that would be even better. All said, we're very happy with our stay, and will definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Universal!", "title": "Good for price but could improve on certain things.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BlaineandAimee", "date": "March 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126614315}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed at this hotel so we could attend the Arnold Palmer Invitational Golf Tournament.
