The room is modern-looking, sheets clean, beds comfy and the free wi-fi was great. Didn't have any trouble with the TV and there were indeed a lot of channels to choose from. Staff is friendly and responsive. The breakfast buffet was fine and the dining room has a nice view. That said, there are some shortcomings and I'm not sure I would stay again. There are design flaws as others have pointed out and a lot of cheap shortcuts in the construction. The shower head was super high, about right for someone over 6' tall, bathtub also very high, sink rather low, the faucet loose and leaking, part of the wallpaper in the room peeling, the Toto type toilet was not working (flushed fine but just not the extra features) and the electrical cord for the toilet was strung across the button to flush the toilet. The location is fairly convenient but it's 20-25 min walk to Sukhbaatar square and traffic, of course, is often terrible. There was a wedding going on the weekend we stayed there and it seemed many of the guests were staying on our floor which meant very drunk guests carousing in the hallway at all hours.
