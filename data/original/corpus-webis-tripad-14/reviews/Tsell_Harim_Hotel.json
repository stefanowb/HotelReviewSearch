There are very few (4?) hotels in Ein Bokek, that stand directly on the beach. Most of the luxury glass palaces do not. Out of these four, Tsell Harim is the only one bungalow style complex, where You can park the car inside next to Your door, and in case of second-floor rooms, enjoy privacy in enclosed teracess with high walls so that nobody sees You sunbathing or relaxing.Is there any other hotel like this in that area? No, You can\u00b4t find this in any other tower-style hotels there. Breakfasts were sufficient, swimming pool refreshingly cold and yes, the interiors were worn and not clean in many corners. Pricing was bellow the local level. The advantages clearly outweighted the flaws.", "title": "It\u00b4s about the location and style", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Beersheva", "date": "February 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 98120169}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were at the Dead Sea for one night to climb Masada and enjoy some time at the Dead Sea.
