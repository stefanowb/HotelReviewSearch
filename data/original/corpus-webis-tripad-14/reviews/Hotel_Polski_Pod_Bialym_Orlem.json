Kind of a mix of socialist furniture with faux French styling, the friendly staff are very knowledgable about their beautiful city. Walking distance to everything you want to see, but taxis are plentiful and cheap (but make the deal before you get in). Walking distance to the train station if you don't have luggage. Right next door is the museum with Leonardo Da Vinci's \"Lady with the Weasel\". Very charming, and I have stayed there twice and will stay there again.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 23, 2005", "id": 3026257}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2004, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is in a perfect location, just inside the city walls at the Florianska gate and therefore easy to walk anywhere in the old town. The hotel has been beautifully modernised and our room was big and light and airy. The staff speaks english and seems efficient. No shower curtain at the bath means it is impossible to shower without soaking the floor (which has a drain in it, so it must be OK to do that except there isn't anywhere to put your clothes...) and the room was rather noisy from the street, with no double glazing and echoes bouncing off the town wall (particularly hoof beats from the carriage horses and drunken shouts of weekend revellers). Breakfast was adequate, and the hotel was spotlessly clean throughout. I have no experience of any other Cracovian hotel but this one seems well run, inexpensive, and nicely located and I would have no hesitation in recommending it for a weekend base in Krakow.", "title": "Clean and airy", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "straysheep", "date": "September 11, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 2524066}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "My 4th visit to Krakow and first visit to this hotel.

The room was simple but adequate and even the single room was fine, which is usually the weak point when we travel together. The breakfasts were yummy and if you wanted a cooked breakfast, you only had to ask and one was provided without charge or any fuss. Needless to say with all the brilliant food we experienced during our stay, we didn't need a large breakfast after the first day!
