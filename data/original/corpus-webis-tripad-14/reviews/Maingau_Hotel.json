I'm not sure I would want to stay here if I were spending a lot of time in the room, but it was entirely adequate for the one night stopover we had.

For eight years now, we've been staying at the Maingau as we come into and go out of the city and have always been pleased. It's a nice German-run hotel with a German flavor as opposed to all those chain hotels at the airport. And it's less expensive too. The restaurant is top for the inclusive breakfast or for dinner (which is extra). But there's a multitude of eateries within walking distance for authentic German cuisine. We recommend the Gemalte Haus. Distance to the airport is very \"do-able\". We take a taxi to and from. If you go, reserve in advance and be sure to ask for a non-smoking room or you will most likely get a room that smells like smoke, which can be unpleasant. Also, ask for a balcony. Bathrooms are generally small, but efficient. Parking is practically non-existent, but if you do have a car, let them know and they will usually arrange parking for you. However, you won't need a car once you are there. The longtime frontdesk manager at the hotel has recently retired (2003) and we have not been back since so not sure if everything is still run as efficiently as we have known it, but give it a try.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Tourist064", "date": "February 26, 2005", "id": 3231912}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful for the Price!", "text": "The hotel staff here were all enormously friendly. In this small German hotel, they usually remembered my name and even my room number. My room was quite tiny, but very clean and very adequate for a trip when I really was only in the room at night to sleep. The shower and bathroom were small, and the sink was actually in the room, not in the tiny bathroom -- but the bed was comfortable, the water was warm, and the price was incredibly small. Breakfast each morning was delicious with a great variety of foods, and the restaurant in the hotel is outstanding. The hotel is in a pleasant residential neighborhood, and yet just a short walk across the bridge to the cathedral and the most scenic part of Frankfurt. There are delightful neighborhood restaurants within walking distance with wonderful food and great atmosphere. The other guests were mostly European, and I had the impression that some stayed there regularly.

I feel like I could rely on it to be the same 5 years from now. The front desk staff seems to take a personal interest in the well-being of it's guests. They always went out of their way to help me find my way around the city and always remembered my name. I booked a double room. It was perhaps slightly smaller than I'd expected, but not too small. The bathroom was a bit tight in the toilet area, but the shower was ample and there was good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Rather than offer individual soaps and shampoos, the management chose to use an all-in-one shower gel attached to the wall (see photo). Its a matter of taste whether you like that. I think it's acceptable for a 3 star hotel, but prefer separate items. I thought the glasses in the bathroom were a bit thin and delicate. They could break easily. The bed was comfortable, with a nice comforter on it, and the pillows were wonderfully large. I found the room a bit warm. The room didn't have individual climate control, so it perhaps it could be much too warm in the summer. The large window opens, so I was able to get some air into the room and cool it down. That might not be so effective on a hot summer night. The hotel is in an appealing older residential district away from the highrises, on a park, and just 5 minutes walk to the banks of the Rhine. There are plenty of nearby restaurants and small shops around. There are a few convenience stores around, but not open at night. The closest tram and metro stops are 5 to 10 minutes walk from the hotel, so if you aren't a walker or have a lot of luggage, take a taxi to and from the train stations or airport. I was attending a trade show at the Messe, and the 16 tram (5 minutes walk) took me there in 15 minutes. One tip: book from a website like Venere.com if you can. It will be cheaper than booking over the phone.
