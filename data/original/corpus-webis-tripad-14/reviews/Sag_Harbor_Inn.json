The website makes it seem like this \"beautiful, romantic getaway,\" but when we arrived, much to our disappointment, the inn did not meet our expectations. The front desk wasn't the least bit friendly, and the strange odor while walking up to our room was disgusting to say the least. When we walked into our room, it looked like a cheap, broken down motel. The ceiling was moldy, and what looked to be a once white color now resembled yellow stains. The television dates back 20 years, while the horrific furniture, paintings, and overall design of the place was old and out-dated. When we called to complain about the situation, the front desk did not help us in anyway, and simply said they were sorry they were all booked, meanwhile in the 4 days we spent there, we did not see many visitors at all. Oh, and the \"complimentary breakfast\" included mini bagels, mini muffins, and what looked like old fermented fruit. Not worth the money in anyway!
