It is located about a block away from the galleries on Canyon Road and a short walk to the Plaza. Close enough for convenience, but nice and quiet. We booked and stayed in a Deluxe King that was located on the lower level. There was a small patio with a wall dividing us from the parking lot, which was tall enough to give us privacy, but anyone walking by could certainly peer over if they wanted to. The room was spacious and had a kiva fireplace (gas). We really only used it once as the weather was not cool enough for us to get the full benefit of a fire. If I were to return I would not pay extra for a room with fireplace as I think it is more of a novelty. The Breakfast Buffet has lots of delicious options to choose from including hot items. You can sit inside or outside in the courtyard which is lovely. The exterior of the hotel is built with adobe elements and decorated with the typical ristras (dried bunches of red chiles) and there is a faint scent of pinon pine in the air. The inn also offers a complimentary happy hour with sangria, beer, iced coffee, etc and they do a really generous buffet of cheeses, olives, bread, crudites and other snacks. This was however the most expensive hotel we stayed in during our trip ($243 + tax a night) so all those extras are worked into the rate. If I returned to Santa Fe, I would probably stay here again and would definitely recommend it to others. The staff is very good and were very proactive about confirming our stay and sending us some information on the local area ahead of time.", "title": "Great Santa Fe Location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WHERESWAUGH", "date": "October 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 84147209}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled on business", "text": "What a lovely place, with warm caring staff, and incredible proximity to everything Santa Fe!

Plus the option of upgrading to lattes, etc., for extra fee. Seating areas are not crowded, and the public rooms are intimate spaces with beautiful southwest decor.

It listed numerous available rooms and we saw a room with a king size bed listed for $91.00 with a AAA card, which we have. Since we were 10 to 15 minutes away we decided not to book it online, but to drive straight to the hotel.

She said, \"Yes, and because you are here I can offer you a 20% discount with your card. The rate will be $180.00\". I explained that it was listed as $91 online and she said she did not see that. She then said the most inexpensive room she could offer us was a third floor room that had no elevator. I told her it wasn't a matter of price, but of principle. My husband asked if she had Internet access and she told us it was in the adjoining room. When we searched their site we were not able to view the available rooms as the computer did not have the lastest version of Adobe Flashplayer, and it was necessary to be an \"administrator\" to download it. We went to the front desk again, and were told the property manager had stepped off the property so it could not be done. We told her we would wait. While we waited a few feet away in the lobby, I heard her call the manager and explain the situation. After the phone call she never approached us to tell us what was said, and let us remain sitting. We realized we had our iTouch on us, and were able to view the rates on their web site and then showed them to the receptionist. She told us she could not offer us that price, it was an online price. I asked her if she actually wanted to inconvenience us to the extend we would have to leave and find a computer so that we could book it online, although we were standing right in front of her. We were told that is what we would have to do to get that rate.
