The room was fantastic, and once settled we dined at a table in the courtyard strewn with rose petals... fantastic food - from the Moroccan Fish to the breakfasts every morning - there could be no faults found in any aspect of the services provided..... it was like waking up in a film set every day, and the tranquility provided within the walls of the Riad compared to the hectic-ness of the Medina outside provided a welcome respite. Our only disappointment was that we were visiting Marrakech for a friends wedding and were staying until the Sunday and when we booked the Riad was actually full on the Saturday night so we had to spend our final night in Morocco somewhere else.... we have already resolved to return next year with our son and there is nowhere else we would consider staying.... we cannot wait to return....
