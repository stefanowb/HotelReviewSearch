A complimentary bottle of wine was placed on an antique table in a very beautifully decorated room.

A very modern bathroom completed a wonderfully comfortable living area, inclusive of my own private verandah. Philip and Maryanne were very welcoming and could not do enough to accommodate my needs. The only negative of my stay is that it was for work and I was alone - I felt that the beauty of it all was wasted on me.
