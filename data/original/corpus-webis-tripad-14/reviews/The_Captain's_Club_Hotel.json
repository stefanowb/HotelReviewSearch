My husband and I used the spa after receiving gift vouchers. We both booked a one hour treatment. I'd say it's pretty fair to expect about 50 mins worth of actual work when booking a one hour treatment.We used the jacuzzi prior to the treatment which with it's black, slate type tilings and serene atmosphere was lovely. The young girl said there was something wrong with the sauna and it was running quite cool (for a sauna anyway). My husband's treatment was a 4.15pm. When he hadn't been called for at 4.25pm he asked if he'd got the time right. He was told he had and that they were running a little behind. No problem. At 4.35pm he was called and after the usual de-robing etc the treatment started at 4.40pm. After resurfacing to the pool area, he realised his 1 hr (and very half-hearted massage lasted 35 minutes, \"The worst I've had\" he said). Thinking perhaps they'd thought he had booked a 30 min treatment he left it until we came to pay to see what he was charged. My 'wrap' was nothing short of pathetic. I was basically lightly rubbed in lotion for 15 mins, not even all over, and then loosely wrapped and left for another 25 mins. It really was dismal, and dare I say it, most likely due to the young, fresh of out beauty college, dis-interested staff they had. They really did look like they didn't want to be there. When charged for the full 60 min massage, my husband complained that it was 35 min. She tried to deny it at first, but upon asking for the supervisor was offered \u00a320 off. Pro-rata it was still a rip off but at that point we just paid and vowed never to visit the spa again.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "lovethebeach43", "date": "November 23, 2007", "id": 10997109}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The restaurant however is their shining star in my opinion. Of the several dinners I have had there, I have never been disappointed with the quality and presentation of the food. A wonderful atmosphere, superb decor, quality cuts of meat, imaginative creations AND generous portions - I'm in heaven when dining at the Captain's Club. Their desserts are to die for, with particular mention going to a '3 part' dessert I had last week consisting of an iced butterscotch torte, sticky toffee pudding and crispy banana filo parcels as one dessert, yet somehow each marrying together wonderfully. The food, along with a great selection of wine and Taittinger as their house Champagne really puts them as the best fine dining in the area in my opinion. There are a couple of very, very small things that I noticed that wouldn't happen in, say, a top London restaurant. That is, having to chase wine after the meal was served. The wine or water has never once been topped up by the wait staff during any meals we've had there, and you usually have to ask them to take your coat or jacket. As I said, these are minor things and do not detract from the overall dining experience, but to someone who loves fine dining and service that bowls you over, it was noticeable.", "title": "Great location & views", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "juanberto", "date": "November 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10964622, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 good service and hotel position", "disliked": "\u2014 air con noise!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "If looking for something better than the rest, be it for a stay or for dining, I whole-heartedley recommend the Captain's Club hotel and/or restaurant.
