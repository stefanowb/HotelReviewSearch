The value was excellent and the distance from DC just fine. On one day we took the hotel shuttle to the metro station and received excellent service from the shuttle driver.

The rate was under $95.00 for weekdays and weekends as well. Quite a substantial savings from closer DC hotels. First off, the hotel is a little hard to find. My GPS had us lost and couldn't find the hotel. If you exit at Shady Grove, be sure to stay in the far right lane and after a few sets of lights, you will see the sign on your right. You have to turn right at that corner and the entrance driveway is right there. The hotel is very clean and not what I expected for a Comfort Inn. The foyer has beautiful marble floors. The staff were excellent and very helpful. The complimentary breakfast was great. There is a free Wi Fi connection and guest laundry. The room fit our needs but there were a few things that bugged me. The beds were just full beds and pretty small for two people. The rooms overall seemed small. The maids start cleaning very early and often were at it by 8:00 am. They had the vaccuums running at that time. The pool closed early at 8:00. This hotel overall was very quiet. That is if you shut your air conditioner off at night as that was a bit loud. The location is close to the Metro. You could walk it but I wouldn't. It was about 40 minutes into the city by Metro. Overall, what you get far exceeds the price they charge. The distance while a little inconvenient wouldn't keep me from staying here again. Great budget hotel. One more thing to note is that this hotel has recycling bins right in the rooms.
