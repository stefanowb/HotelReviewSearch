We stayed on the Admiral Floor, check in was efficient and quick, friendly reception staff. The room had two double beds not a huge room but was sufficient for the four nights we stayed. Rooms were clean a little bit of tlc would not go amiss but as it's a 3 star hotel and centrally located we did not expect luxurious surroundings. Centrally located only a 10 min walk to the parks and the train at 2 euro per person stops right outside the hotel if you are not feeling too energetic first thing. Breakfast was continental and plentiful, very busy at certain times but que to be seated moved very quickly so no complaints. We did not have dinner or snacks so unable to comment on the food, soft drinks and alcohol very expensive so we got a taxi into the village and stocked up on beverages and pringles etc which adults and kids enjoyed as late night snacks and saved a lot of money! You can use the subway which is between the village and the parks and the supermarket is only one stop away. It is in a beautiful shopping mall which unfortuately we did not have time to look around but pharmacy is there if travelling with children handy to be aware of as none based in the Disney Village or Park. The Saturday and Sunday in the park was extremely busy and the que's were very long some waiting times were 1 and half hours or more. I would advise booking fast pass tickets if possible as personally I would be reluctant to wait that long for five min on the attractions. Overall a very pleasurable 1st visit to Eurodisney, as I said the Hotel is what it is and we spent most of our time out and about so it was more than adaquate for our time there.

We had just spent three days in Paris at a very nice hotel (Hotel Muguet) and after the hustle and bustle of the city, we were hoping for a relaxing stay at the Newport Bay Club, with more American style amenities (like space) and service. I had booked a 'lakefront' room on the DLP website (classic package, includes breafast and tickets to the two parks), hoping like everyone else for a room facing the lake. Upon entering the room, we smelled cigarette smoke. Very unpleasant for non-smokers and for the fact that my sinuses were acting up. As for the view of the lake - I had to crane my head out to the right to see it. We told reception about the smoke smell and a staff member checked that it was a non-smoking room (tiny sign outside the door). He said - \"oh it's just that probably the person before smoked - we will treat the room and it usually goes away\" . I asked if they had another room and they said no, but we could try tomorrow. I was rather disappointed with this level of service, but I didn't want to spoil things, so I trusted in their smoke treatment. We went off to enjoy the park and did find the room smelt a little better on our return in the evening, but the cig smoke seemed a more permanent feature. That night, I saw a cigarette burn in the night-table and one on the comforter!

We left saying good-bye, only for the hostess to run after us in the lobby to ask if we would like to pay now! I said we paid in cash. She said OK and went back to the desk - I went over to check if all was OK to see the waitress hand the leather folder to the hostess.
