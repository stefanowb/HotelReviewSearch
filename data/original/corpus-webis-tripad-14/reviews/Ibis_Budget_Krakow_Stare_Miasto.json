Hotel is fairly new, clean and comfortable. It is located within a 10 minute walk of the railway station. Hotel is quite large with over 200 rooms. Check-in was fast and friendly. You will be asked to pay for your stay in advance. Rooms are very quiet inside as soundproofing is excellent. Rooms are basic but functional. Free wifi, flat screen tv with only one English channel, shower, basin and toilet. The room had a double bed, which was comfortable, rooms are also air conditioned. Bath towels could be of a little better quality. Buffet breakfast served each morning, extra cost, decent value. Lobby is well kept, there is one computer terminal available.

Rooms are small and reminded me of an IKEA display, the bed is on the hard side, but everything is clean and as expected for this price range. The rooms also don't have phones or hairdryers (there are 3 that are loaned out to guests). What made my stay really enjoyable was the staff who were were great! They spoke very good English and helped me with my Polish, as well as attended to every question and request. The buffet breakfast is ok if you are heading out early: bread, cereals, coldcuts, hotdogs, and yogurts.
