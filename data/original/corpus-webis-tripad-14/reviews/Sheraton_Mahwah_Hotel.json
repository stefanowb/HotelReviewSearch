The hotel was noisy all night with intoxicated college seniors having parties before graduation. Lots of customer complaints overheard, but no solution to the noise problem all night. Desk staff we encountered were either clueless or not interested. Dining room menu was way too expensive for uninspired fare offered, and the servers seemed far more interested in each other than customers. Soup was tepid. Room and hallways had a strong floral disinfectant smell. A couple of lamps in the room didn't work, and those that did had dim bulbs, making reading difficult. No ventilation in the bathroom. Parking lots a hike from front doors, especially with luggage. Not a porter in sight when we arrived. This was a disappointing experience from start to finish, and we were actually glad to check out.

First, when we made the reservations by phone after a long and tiring drive, we were told that we could check in immediately upon arrival and that there were plenty of rooms and because of this, we would be able to get a great view. When we arrived, there were electrical issues and therefore, the desk attendants were unable to find our reservation. We were told we would have to wait in the lobby for a few minutes until the problem was fixed. Almost an hour later, we were waved to the desk and were given a room. The room had the worst view of a construction building with multiple trash dumpsters. We were highly disappointed and called immediately down to the desk. We were told they would look into another room. After about 15 minutes, we went down stairs on our own prepared to leave the hotel after our experiences, but were given an \"upgrade\" of a larger room. We went upstairs and were happy to be in a somewhat larger room, but again, we were given the same view of the building and dumpsters. At this point, neither one of us felt like arguing because by then, it was late, but would be hesitant to recommend this hotel to any of our friends and co-workers.

In my honest opnion, some of the Sheraton hotels are really dated. However, for the ones that have been renovated, the furnishing are modern and the rooms come with flat planel tv. I booked this hotel without checking the reviews first since this is the only Starwood property in the area. I started getting worried the day before our trip after reading reviews about this hotel on this website. I did more digging and found that this hotel started doing some renvation work in August so I kept my fingers crossed that they have completed the renovation. So here we were, after spending a day on the slope, we drove to this hotel as our weekend getaway stop before heading back home. Check-in was a breeze, and our room was on one of their \"lower\" floor - 16th (the guest rooms are on 14th -22nd floors). The glass elevators were exciting, but you might want to look away if you are afraid of height and speed. Our room didn't have much of a view, but it was nice and clean. The bathroom was spacious, with Bliss toiletries, and curved shower curtain rod. Water pressure was good and the shower head did a wonderful job. The room had a big desk, flat planet tv, coffee maker with Starbucks coffee pods. The bed was very comfortable. Everything was better than what I have expected. However, there are areas for improvement - They still use the old motel type of blanket (the light brown one that feels like fleece) even though they have the newer comforter on top, there was stain on the shower curtain, and the walls were very thin that you could hear the tv and other \"actions\" next door. We didn't have a chance to try out the pool and hot tub since we were too tired and sleepy from skiing/snowboarding. We did walk by the restaurant to check out their menu.
