We were greated by gracious and welcoming hosts who made us feel at home. The room was beautiful; full of well preserved antiques. They also had a well manicured garden and a great pool (though the pool was cold, but refreshing). Every morning we were served a delicious breakfast which included fresh eggs, fresh bread, fruit picked from the orchard, jam made from that fruit, and many other delicious treats. During the day we could walk through their orchard and vineyard and eat fresh apricots and cherries as we walked. They also served us some delicious port wine; made from their grapes. Overall it was an amazing stay, I would recommend it for anyone traveling in Portugal.", "title": "Could not have been better!!", "user": "Niwotois", "date": "June 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 163569423}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed for three nights.
