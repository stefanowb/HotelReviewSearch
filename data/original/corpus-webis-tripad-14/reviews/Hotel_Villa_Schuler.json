Taormina (out of season--very important) was the perfect place for us to do that, and the Hotel Villa Schuler was ideal for our purposes. We don't particularly like large, opulent hotels. Instead, we prefer smaller, boutique-type hotels that have local color and charm. The Hotel Villa Schuler was exactly the type of place we enjoy. It's small (21 rooms), impeccably clean and attractive, with fabulous views of both the Ionian Sea and Mount Etna. Our room was spacious, with many thoughtful extra touches, such as jacuzzi jets in the bathtub. There is a lovely garden as part of the hotel, which even has labels on all the exotic plants. The staff is superb. And the walk, via some steps and walkways, up to the main street of Taormina, was quick and easy. (This is important in Taormina, because it is a hill town, and many approaches to the center of town are very strenuous.) The guide books list the Hotel Villa Schuler in the \"moderate\" category. We had a room with a small balcony and a glorious sea view--definitely worth the extra money, we thought. The room was approximately $250 per night, not \"moderate\" by all standards, but considering the tourist popularity of Taormina, relatively reasonable. One can't go wrong at the Villa Schuler.

The room was not huge, but it didn't feel cramped and had all we needed--not lavish furnishings, but we certainly didn't spend a lot of time there, and the view from our private balcony was fabulous. And what a great location, just a couple of minutes from the main street in town, with gorgeous gardens. The terrace where breakfast is served was a wonderful way to start the day, and the breakfast was the best we had on our entire trip. A recent poster complained that the gals at breakfast never smiled--well, the one we saw on several days was quite busy, but very pleasant to us and willing to listen patiently to my ordering in Italian, even though her English was undoubtedly better than my Italian! We found the staff very helpful with our questions, and they provided a great restaurant recommendation--suggesting that the one they mentioned was similar to the one I asked about, but more moderately priced. And I am so glad we reserved a space in the garage!! I would not have wanted to count on finding a public space. The garage was immaculate, as we saw when we accompanied a staffer to our car when we left, and he pulled it onto the street for us. We'd be happy to stay here again. We found the directions on the website very specific and helpful. All in all, considering how expensive Taormina is, we thought this a real value, and would happily recommend it.", "user": "snappy6592", "date": "October 5, 2007", "id": 10043283}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Worth staying just for the breakfasts !", "text": "We have just stayed at the Villa Schuler following very positive reviews from fellow TA correspondents.

Both were spur ot the moment type things - I rang round a couple of other hotels but both times the people at the Villa Schuler got us a good price last minute, plus a 10% discount if you pay in cash. The first time I stayed there we were in room number 5 (I think!) which is worth requesting as it has two small balconies, one with a view of Etna, and the other over the sea. I think we paid about 150 Euros for the room for that night, and it was very good value. The rooms aren't luxurious, but very clean and with a flat screen TV, comfortable beds and plenty of storage. The bathroom seemed to be all new and immaculate. From our window in the other room (number 14) we had a view over the beautiful garden at the back of the hotel. Walk through the garden and you are in the middle of Taormina. The kids loved the turtles in the pond and the lemons on the trees. Breakfast was served on the terrace overlooking the sea and Etna - service was friendly and efficient and the food was great.
