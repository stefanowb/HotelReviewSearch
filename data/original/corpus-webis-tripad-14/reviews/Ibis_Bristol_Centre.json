The bed was clean and very comfortable which is the main part. When you opened the curtains, although we were on the 4th floor the people in the buildings accross could see in, to get dressed you had to close the curtains and it was dark. I mentioned this to reception and nets were up at the windows in 5 min :~) So it pays to ask ..
