Staff were friendly and helpful always. Concierge went absolutely out of his way to help us, making his night manager baby sit our children when the baby sitter didn't turn up on time. We stayed in an immaculate modern 2 bedroom suite which felt like a hotel suite but still had its own kitchenette (with washing machine and dryer built in) and dining area which we so needed to cater for small kids. The room was cleaned every day by staff who even washed up the plates I had left in the kitchen. FYI: The hotel did also had an impressive 3 bedroom apartment with 2 levels (loft style feel) but unfortunately did not suit us because of the floating stairs and our small toddler who would have loved them! Only negative thing I could possibly say is it had a small pool that was a little chilly (not heated) but it was outside with a stunning bar area and our kids did have a lot of fun in it!

There is a roof top bar and pool - a little windy in the afternoon in Autumn. There are amazing spa rooms and a small gym. The staff were very friendly. The helpful, knowledgable concierge will find you a good restaurant or eat in the hotel's upmarket steak house (good fish and vegetarian options too). Outside the hotel, try Il Leone (Italian), Mama Africa (African with dancing and singing) or 4 Quay (by the waterfront).

The hotel is imposing and beautiful, right across the road from the gorgeous new soccer stadium. Rooms are spacious, but not homely - there's even an echo in the large 2-bedroom suites and upon arrival we were greeted by an orange dustcloth on a shelf that had not been removed by the night cleaner on our arrival day either. Second day when we got back the duster was gone but a dirty towel had been left in the bath - not really what you expect from 5*. Also had a cleaner show up before our breakfast had arrived to ask if we want the room cleaned - yes, but when we're out not when we're eating! We had room service and snacks all 3 nights: food is not the best: burger was watery and caesar salad completely drenched in dressing (1800 degrees downstairs does the same caesar salad but it was so much better - the best caesar salad I've ever had actually, just the room service one was poor). Breakfast was ok, but not great: I ordered smoked salmon and scrambled eggs which in Europe means you get smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, not f r i e d smoked salmon and scrambled eggs together.
