If you like Madeira wine, or their famouse sweet bread/food products, then that's the place to indulge. The hotel room was very clean, spacious, the TV had a few English channels i.e BBC, CNN, a sports channel, a few movie channels mainly in Portuguese, or if you got lucky had English subtitles. Breakfast was adequate. Yogurt tasted funny though, but the fruit was fresh, buffet consisted of tasty Portuguese bread rolls, a few trays of sugar-carb foods such as doughnuts, danishes filled with fruit jams or chocolate, cookies (which we avoided) but there was also warm scrambled eggs, wheat crackers, pacquets of butter,honey, phily cream cheese, jams etc, a good assortment of cereales with granola, nuts to mix, and assortment of fresh cheese. The coffee machine was mostly my saviour, which served lattes(galao -in Portuguese), cafe Americano (which is like an espresso), and they had an assortment of teas. The only peculiar food at the buffet was the \"hotdogs\". I read a review previously, that someone said there were hotdogs at the buffet. I thought the person meant sausages - you know, the little typical breakfast sausages. I didn't think they meant actual hotdogs (some) North Americans eat. Well, I was shocked to find they DID serve hotdogs - Schneider hotdogs. That was hillarious. Why would anyone serve such a disgusting thing for breakfast? The other downside at breakfast were the waitors. They stand around and gawk at the women as if they never seen women before. Come on, who wants to be gawked at during breakfast after seeing those whithered, smelly hotdogs they serve? Ugh...give me a break,lol. All in all, good value for money, location is great, area is reletively safe - it does get quiet at night around 11pm, you can bring children to the hotel, AC adequate but no AC in the hallways so for the drama Kings and Queens, deal with it t'll you get to your room. Also, the reception desk staff could use better customer service especially if they are giving you the wrong directions.. ie. a ferry is NOT the only way to get to the Algarve (lol), you can take a bus or a train - but the bus (evora) is the best way. Took us less than 3 hours to get to Albufeira, Algarve. Don't bother asking this hotel desk for any information, go to the subway and ask the guard there, or better yet, if you see a police officer, ask them. They are friendly, speak some English and know Lisbon by the back of their hand and will give you CORRECT directions.", "title": "Mixed feelings", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jan-Ole", "date": "January 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 12725580, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Attitude"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here in November 2007 for 2 nights, and then again later that week for one more night.
