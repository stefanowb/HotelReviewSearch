The oversized credenza that held the TV, dresser drawers, and closet all in one unit was way to big for the room. Made it really hard to pass between the bed and credenza without running into the doors that swung outward. The bathroom was \"shower only\"... so if you are looking to soak in the tub then your out of luck. The hotel was totally booked but I never once heard another soul. The rooms were extremely quiet!!! The breakfast room was quite small and we were lucky enough to find a table, but noticed several couples coming in and taking their food back to their rooms. They did offer a very nice breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. Toast, fruit, cereal etc... pretty much everything to fill up for the morning.

Plus: Nice bed linens (double sheeted), quality towels, good bath products, satisfactory Wifi, ok pool area, adequate complimentary breakfast. Minus: Property not aesthetically pleasing (though we could view Pilot Butte from our 2nd floor room), room a little tight, motel-like feel with exterior doors and though it was 'surface clean' I felt better after wiping handles, light switches, remote, etc. with a lysol wipe. If you want to save $$, just need a place to sleep then this should be fine for you (it was quiet at night). Don't expect it to be a three star property.
