We didn't know this at the time of our booking. There is also nothing around it as far as eateries, shopping or attractions. During our stay, there was a business conference during one day and that is what the hotel is probably more suited for. Our first night, we arrived late in the afternoon and our only option for dinner was the hotel's restaurant. We found this to be expensive, had a limited menu and our meal wasn't that nice. The breakfast next morning was adequate, but the service wasn't. On both mornings we encountered problems and there wasn't a staff member anywhere to ask for help. First the coffee and juice machines didn't work. The next morning there was no bread for the toaster, then the toaster didn't work. My husband eventually had to walk into the kitchen to find someone to ask for help. Many times the front desk was unattended and there was never anyone behind the bar. In general, the hotel reception areas were deserted. There was a distinct lack of communication between staff as on checkout, we were asked for payment for our restaurant meal even though we'd paid on the night. The staff member we'd paid was standing beside the consierge when we were asked for payment. Luckily we had a receipt. Our hotel room was nice and clean, however the room was very hot and the walls seemed to be quite thin as we could hear snoring and noises from other guests.
