My husband and I were so excited when we set off on our trip, however on walking into our room, I cried. It was not particularly clean, it smelt (as did the corridor) and was far from being even classed as outdated. The view was onto a parking lot and the noise from the busy road was intolerable. Lucky enough we were upgraded to a better room at no charge, but I would never go back. We queued for the complimentary breakfast which was below standard. The juice was served in paper cups and the eating area was not appealing with many dirty dishes left on tables.

The hotel itself is about a 3 star but being next to the International Market Place and 2 blocks from Waikiki Beach was perfect. We originally had a partial ocean view room on the 15th floor with an ok view, but after we had a peeping-tom neighbor stick his head around our balcony divider and look into our room at 6: AM while we were laying in bed drinking our coffee the management moved us to the 21st floor with an amazing view of Waikiki Beach and a much nicer room. Couldn't believe someone could be that stupid to lean over the railing around the privacy divider and look into someone else's room! The rooms are a little small and not real plush, but comfortable and clean enough. The breakfast that was included in the rate was very good and we liked the pool area with lots of loungers and sun. We were so busy seeing and doing all of the Honolulu and Waikiki stuff that we weren't in our room that much anyway.

My husband and I are 60 yrs old and retired. We stayed 7 days and although we were not in the room that much, for maybe the same or a few dollars more we could have stayed in a nicer hotel. We had the best room there was according to the front desk, which meant we saw the ocean from our balcony alright, but there were mutiple hotels in the view between our hotel and the ocean. Never saw the sunset from our balcony. That view was blocked by buildings. The rooms are clean, staff are friendly and helpful but everything is tired and worn including the rug. Bed was comfortable. Frig was handy. We had breakfast included in our package from the travel agent and that was nice as it saved some money. If not I am not sure I would not have paid the $19.50US each for breakfast at Sammys. It was good but that is a lot of money for breakfast. The toaster did not work well at all and seemed a simple fix but it was not fixed for the week we were there. We did not travel to Hawii to stay in the motel, so overall is was alright, but my next visit will not be there. Good location??? There are lots of them in good locations and you can get to the International market from almost anywhere, besides the Beach is what we wanted. We ate at Chilis across the street, barbequed our own meat at the ShoreBird? at Waikiki Shore Hotel on the beach,met new friends Jerri and Dave for dinner at Cheesecake Cafe. Hiked Diamond Head, snorkled Hanauma Bay twiced, bussed the North Shore for surfing competitions, swam Waikiki Beach where I even managed to see a turtle. Bus system worked well ( $2.25 correct change needed). Also used the taxis who stop at bus stops and yell at you $5.00 Hanama Bay because they get you there direct once the van is full that is. I now understand that there is a van that stops at Duke's statue on Waikiki Beach and for $5.00 each way you can go to the discount mall. Lots of shopping if that is your thing. Loved Hawaii and felt very safe there, no beggers, friendly locals, street entertainment at night,whatever you heart desires is avaiable. The 20% tipping gets a little expensive for us, but when the service is great we did not mind as much. We do not like to insult Hawaiians by not tipping the 20%, but they have to remember that the holiday was already more expensive that may other beach all inclusive resorts. We will be back to Hawaii, just not this hotel. 2nd week we flew to Maui and loved that as well.

There are tons of hotels to choose from in this location. My question is would you fly all this way, pay three times the Miramar rates to stay in a fancier hotel with more facilities and not step outside the building? If so, go ahead. For me, I was happy with a basic, decent hotel with good approachable staff and a safe clean place to sleep. I spent each day and a good part of the night enjoying the great weather, beaches, restaurants and crowds just outside the door. My wife and I had a room issue that was corrected quickly.
