Service at the front desk was great! Gerry and a couple of other young ladies at the front desk were excellent answering questions, helping us navigate the area, recommending restaurants. We were surprised that the property didn't have air conditioning, but were lucky that the room had a fan, because the several days we were there it was hot outside. Our room faced the street, which constantly has cars and trams going through. So, we had to keep the windows closed during the night. There are 2 laundry facilities across the street in case you have an extended trip. Cost about $25 to do 2 loads and dry our clothes. The room itself wasn't very big, but had a nice sized bathroom. There was very little room between the bed and the wall as a walkway. The metal corners of the bed were sharp, and both my wife and I came home with scratches on the calves of our legs from walking around the bed. The restaurant attached to the hotel had poor service and poor food. The TV in the room had only 1 or 2 English speaking channels. Cleaning staff did a nice job for us each morning. On the last day of our stay we went upstairs to the rooftop and enjoyed a beer and glass of wine. It was a nice ending to our stay.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "doganabeer", "date": "August 11, 2013", "id": 171779367}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great little hotel.

We arrived in the middle of a heat wave, very jet lagged, and were wowed at how easy it was to get to the hotel from the airport. The front desk was extremely welcoming and apologetic regarding the heat, but really it was among the most comfortable rooms during our entire German stay! We had a basic double bed room and it was exactly the size we needed. Extremely comfy bed and very spacious bathroom with excellent shower and toiletry items. The hotel is decorated in a cute trendy manner without being obnoxious. A real highlight of the hotel is its location. You are directly above a major transit stop and within walking distance to so many of Berlin's most delicious restaurants and fun bars.

The room faces Rosenthaler Str. and the windows, despite clearly being of very high quality, did not really manage to keep out the noise, so we were woken up early by the sound of the tram. The noise problem was compounded by the fact that the hotel is not air-conditioned. There was a fan, but the room was nevertheless somewhat stuffy. Given the noise, opening the windows was not an option. If and when it gets hot (which does occasionally happen even in Germany :-)) it would get rather uncomfortable in that room. Also, if I had been traveling on business the small work desk would not have been sufficient to work on comfortably. On the plus side, we found the hotel staff to be really, really friendly and knowledgeable. We got an excellent, spot-on restaurant recommendation and the people we encountered clearly wanted to help and knew their way around the city. The location on Rosenthaler Platz is wonderful when traveling for leisure; the neighborhood is extremely pleasant to walk around in and the Circus has its own lovely roof-top terrace bar (of sorts; it's self-service drinks from a fridge but fantastic views and a really nice atmosphere). Lack of AC and the noise aside, the room was very nicely designed and the bed was comfortable, too. All in all, my bottom line on the Circus Hotel is: 1. I would not stay there when traveling on business. There are too many better options in Berlin. 2. If you stay there make sure you get a room facing the inner courtyard.", "title": "Spacious Apartment!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mary42763", "date": "August 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 171805238}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Circus Hotel is located in a great location.
