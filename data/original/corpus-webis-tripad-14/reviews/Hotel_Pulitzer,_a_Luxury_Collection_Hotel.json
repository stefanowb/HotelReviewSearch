Some years ago I bought two garden tables and without asking the tables were bundled up securely to protect them from the flight home. They arrived home without a scratch! The Service in the Restaurant is excellent and the food imaginative and delicious. I have eaten at other 'best' hotels in Amsterdam but there is something about the Pulitzer that makes it stand apart from the rest. The rooms are very well decorated and maintained to a high standard. The canal rooms are light and airy and have magnificent marble bathrooms. As the hotel is built within a number of canal houses, finding ones way around can be daunting for the faint-hearted, but all corridors lead to the well-designed enclosed passageway across the central garden courtyard. Check-in and check-out couldn\u2019t be easier and the staff at the reception are charming, efficient and knowledgeable.
