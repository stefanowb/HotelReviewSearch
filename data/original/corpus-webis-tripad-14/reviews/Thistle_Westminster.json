It is urgently in need of a complete renovation. My room was extremely basic and decorated in a dredful 70`s style. It was impossible to look out of the window due to the ingrained dirt and grunge, and consequently very little light was let into the room. It seems as though the windows have never been cleaned. I was kept awake all night by noisey work going on on a next door building site, and was quite honestly glad to get out of the place earlier than I planned.

This is after they had already reduced the room rate over the telephone. The hotel is very clean and well presented, all staff that we had dealings with were very helpful. It is situated in a great location for all the normal London sights, theatres and only a very short walk from Victoria train and coach stations. All in all we had a great stay at this hotel and will definately be staying again when we visit London. Another tip if you would prefer to eat out, the Bag of Nails pub over the road does some great food at very good prices.", "title": "Excellent Stay *****", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jason b", "date": "April 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127237227}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Hotel seemed nice but staff and processes couldn't handle a busy weekend.

Reception staff were efficient friendily and helpful. We had two double rooms opposite each other on the first floor. These were comfortable, clean and quiet. Room facilities, e.g. bathroom, Tea/coffee making and iron/iron board were good. The only small issue was the room temperature which was a little too warm. There was a heating system with a cool setting but this was ineffective. We were visiting London for the weekend to see Wicked (Saturday) at the Victoria Apollo and experience the Sport Relief (Sunday) events along the Mall. The hotel is ideally situated for this Theatre, Victoria station, Buckingham palace and is only a 10/15 minutes walk from Trafalgar square. We did not use the hotel restaurant. There are many reasonsably priced restaurants and cafes nearby which we used for evening meal/Breakfast.
