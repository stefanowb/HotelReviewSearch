We were going to cancel at Azalea to stay where we stayed our first night (Comfort Inn, Smithfield), but when calling Bernadette informed us of the 48 cancelation policy. So we stayed at Azalea and are so glad we did! The rooms were large, clean and very comfortable. At first glance of the busy road the house was on, I would think it would have been very noisy at night, but our room overlooked the beautiful garden and had no problem sleeping. It is a bit on the outskirts of city centre, so a 15 euro taxi or the bus is your best way of getting in. The breakfast and bright breakfast room was a perfect way to end our trip. I would highly recommend Azalea!~", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mag1007", "date": "May 11, 2007", "id": 7589088}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "My brother and I arrived in Dublin on a Monday afternoon, Azalea Lodge had only 1 vacancy, however, the Sweeneys arranged for my brother to stay a night at another B & B, accommodating at it's finest!

We didn't get to Dublin until after the sun had set and I knew this would cause a problem finding the B&B and I was right. When we finally did locate the Azalea Lodge, Bernadette saw us in and to our rooms. Since we were traveling with two sets of golf clubs, Padraig had agreed to let us keep our car in their garage, which was great. Be warned! Parking is at a premium near the B&B. Best thing to do is find a spot and leave your car there and take the bus into downtown Dublin. Don't even consider driving downtown. It's a madhouse! It's very easy to catch a bus into and out of downtown from the B&B. My room was actually a twin which was quite nice. The bed was very comfortable, the towels were plush and the water pressure in the shower was excellent, which can be a problem at some places you stay. The breakfast was the standard Irish breakfast. No surprises here. Bernadette did some laundry for me, a shirt, a pair of trousers and underwear which she charged 10 euros for, which I thought was a bit expensive. My travel companion had a \"real\" single room. The room had a nice size bed in it and it took up most of the room. Plus, his room faced the street which brought with it all the traffic noise. He would probably say he wouldn't stay here again, but my experience was quite different because of my room size and its location. I will stay here again but I would make sure my room did not face the street.", "title": "Great Location, Friendly Owner", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "TRyan", "date": "September 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5767891}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We only had one night in Dublin (July 17, 2006) before flying to England, and we stayed at the Azalea Lodge upon the advice of our daughter who had stayed there previously.
