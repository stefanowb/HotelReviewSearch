Our travel agent got us a pretty reasonable deal for the accommodation here as we had no prior knowledge of either Macau or its hotels. Our 2 night stay was most enjoyable. We were upgraded to the executive level and were treated with great courtesy from the time we arrived. Our room was very spacious with a large King sized bed and a very clean and spacious bathroom which included a bath. A buffet breakfast was included but I found the Western choices to be a bit limited in comparison to those I had enjoyed at the Hong Kong hotel we had stayed in. Unfortunately, we had to leave the hotel by six am in order to catch the ferry to Hong Kong and missed out on the buffet for our last morning but when we told the staff about this, they very kindly organised for a breakfast box to be sent to our room prior to our departure. Beware if, like us, you do have to take the first ferry to Hong Kong airport, that the shuttle bus does not operate at six and we therefore had to organise a taxi, which fortunately was not too difficult at that time! during our stay, we were given a voucher which gave us a coctail and cake each afternoon in the hotel lobby which, again, was a very nice gesture, especially as the cakes were of a very high quality! We found all the staff to very attentive and were quite suprised to see that the hotel was regarded as a three star one as, to us, it certainly seemed to be quite luxurious! We would be more than happy to stay at this hotel if we ever visited Macau again.", "user": "karen2558", "date": "January 26, 2013", "id": 150652034}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Clean room, friendly helpful staff, good restaurants", "text": "We spent 2 nights here in Jan'13.

The hotel is just minutes away from the old city sights, and it's worth walking over to the Lisboa at night just to catch the lights.

We scanned the tripadvisor reviews and based our choice tor this hotel soley upon the tripadvisor reviews made this a good choice. It didn't hurt that the hotel is centrally located, or the fact that we were able to score a bargain rate at the last minute. We were even more enthused when we upgrade to an Executive level room at checkin, and actually stepped foot inside the room. We had only been hoping for a clean room with somewhat comfortable beds, but to our surprise it was a large room that was spotlessly clean, had a good view, and was stocked with features and amenities that bordered on luxurious, even approaching five star quality. The room was also free from the lingering stench of cigarette smoke that is commonplace in Asia's \"nonsmoking\" hotel accomodations. The hotel's casino is spread out on several floors, with segregated space for slots, table games and high stake, big roller lounges, although we spent most of our time at other nearby casinos that were within walking distance. Food at the onsite restaurants is good, and there are other restaurants off site that are easily within walking distance. Overall, I give this hotel high marks, and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. I hope to stay again here soon wihen I return to Hong Kong.", "user": "Donbassero", "date": "July 2, 2012", "id": 133223403}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Tops!", "text": "Our booking via travel agent was upgraded from deluxe to executive room on level 19. Room size was smaller than deluxe on nonsmoking level 17 but we got a bath whereas larger room had no bath. If u want nonsmoking you hv to tell them at check in. Renovations going on at level 14 but noise at level 19 bearable. Overall room facilities are tops. My husband fell sick within a few hours of check in. The guest services staff from the bellhop to manager provided excellent assistance in organising ambulance through to picking us up for the return trip back to hospital and buying medication or us.

It was unexpectedly spacious even we already had a single bed and a queen size bed in the room. The beds were comfortable and clean and everything (shower, aircon, tv, etc) was functioning well. The front desk staff were friendly when we asked for recommendations and directions. Location was not an issue if you want to get from one hotel casino to another because it seemed like every hotel was providing free shuttle bus service, The breakfast spread was reasonable. The only drawback was the experience we had with the serving staff during breakfast - (1) The waiters kept wanting to clear our cutlery when we were still at the table. we were fine they cleared our plates but not the cutlery. There were six of us and we all agreed that it was only right to clear our cutlery only when we left the table (2) The attitude of the chef who was cooking noodles and serving dim sum was disappointing as well.
