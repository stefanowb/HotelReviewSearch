The staff tried very hard to be accomodating. Very pretty hotel, spotless bathrooms. However, some of the stuff in the hotel is not ready yet. The self serve laundry was not complete, the business center was also not ready. The dining, breakfast area in the lobby was great, beautiful. The staff were all friendly and accomodating. Parking is $15/night/car. The rooms are still a work in progress. We stayed 5 nights and on the 1st night there was an exhaust fan in the bedroom that stayed on all night and blasted air into the room. It was loud and irritating. The next day they came to fix it, but when I called at 5 am they did not have any maintenance people on hand. Room service was fast. Ice machines were also not available yet, but room service was fast in delivering ice. 2 flat panel tv's. Walls were very very thin. Could easily hear what people next door were watching. About 1/2 of their rooms have windows facing interior atrium, but no windows facing out of the building. First few nights it was different, in a nice way, to face the interior atrium. However, after 5 nights it became depressing that there was no natural light in the rooms. Wet bar had a sink, microwave and small refrigerator.

But our one night at the Embassy Suites in Glendale was fantastic. The hotel is very nice and clean. We particularly liked the lobby pond with the turtles and fish. I didn't have many interactions with the staff but everyone seemed to be quite nice. The rooms were very nicely decorated. I actually thought that the rooms were some of the nicest I have seen in a hotel in a long time. Nice paint colors, nice glass shower, nice fixtures, nice carpeting, very fresh towels, etc. The beds are exceptional, I slept like a baby. We had one issue where the TV in the living space didn't work, but within a few hours the desk sent someone up to fix it. Even the parking was hassle free. Parking was rolled into the bill but it was nice to park in the underground garage and have in/out privledges. My only suggestion for the hotel would be to add at least one more set of washers and dryers for folks that want to do a quick load. We waited for hours because someone had the machines tied up doing a huge load of wash.
