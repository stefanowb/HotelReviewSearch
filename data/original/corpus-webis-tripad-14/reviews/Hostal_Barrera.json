I love to walk, and the convenience to the metro, the Atocha train station, and the big 3 museums (Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and Renia Sofia) is a huge plus. Note that it wouldn't be good for the handicapped, because the street is somewhat sloping. The immediate neighborhood isn't super trendy, and generally I found more hip bars and restaurants elsewhere, but there were some local places to eat at reasonable prices. As other reviewers have mentioned, the family that runs the hostal is super helpful, like explaining to me exactly how to find the bus station going to Segovia, or arranging a taxi to the airport for me at 5 am. My room was a single, and thus small, but it was very clean, particularly the bathroom which had new fixtures. Air conditioning worked well. I could hear a bit of noise from the other guests-- it wasn't bad, particularly by spanish standards, but it isn't soundproofed or anything. The hostal is on busy street, but most of the rooms overlook a side street and I couldn't hear the traffic noise unless someone honked their horn. Overall, it wasn't the ritz, but I could never afford to stay at the ritz anyway!
