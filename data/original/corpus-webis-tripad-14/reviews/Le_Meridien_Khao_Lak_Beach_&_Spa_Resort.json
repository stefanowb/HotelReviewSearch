After much deliberation we chose the Meridien. It epitimises eveything anyone could want in a hotel. We had a Lagoon Villa and it was amazing, the details so well thought out. Near the beach too. Excellent staff who anticipated your wishes. Definitely a chill out zone. About 7km outside the town but we had a hire car so did not feel isolated. Would certainly consider going back.", "title": "Fabulous Hotel", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Chrissie77", "date": "December 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6320302, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The sheer luxury", "disliked": "\u2014 Likes everything"}}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Khao Lak"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 52, "average": 111, "very good": 271, "terrible": 13, "excellent": 653}, "aka": "Le Meridien Khao Lak Beach Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.35593220339, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "A contemporary Thai-style resort among the exotic fragrant foliage is situated on a 13km pristine beach and near to the untouched rainforests.
