The only issue I had was that the air condition had rust on it around where it meets up to the wall and the shower had some molding spots in the corner. The hotel staff was very friendly throughout my 5 day stay and the pool is really good, especially if you have kids.

Pool was smaller than expected but we realize people are there to go to the beach, a short walk away. The beach was less crowded than areas further south.

Stayed this time for 9 nights, just with my wife - no kids in tow this time. We arrived a couple of hours early, but our room was ready for us. We had requested a Sea View room which they accommodated. The room was excellent, on the 6th floor with a good view of the Cocoa Beach seafront. Rooms had been recently refurbished and the huge king sized bed was really comfortable. All of the staff were excellent - nothing is too much trouble for them. We used the pool area regularly, which was nicely presented and clean. The Bistro was useful for lunchtime snacks, and as before, a special mention must go out to Rita, who is a real treasure, and treats us like family every time we visit.

The lobby is decorated modern. Very nice and clean. Rooms need a little updating, especially the carpets. A little worn and stained. Staff are very friendly. There is a table set up for Internet use and a big seating area in the lobby. Plenty of tables to sit at. They don't have a free breakfast here. Food and drinks are for purchase only. Pool area is nice. Tiki bar is open on Friday and Saturday nights. They have select drinks offered at Happy Hour. Happy Hour is offered inside or outside at the Tiki Bar by the pool. They also have a fire pit in the evenings. Located near the famous Ron Jon Surf Shop. McDonald's is located across the street. There is a grocery store nearby and it's located on the same side of the street as the Beach but not directly on the Beach. Just a short walk to yhe Beach. Every room on the upper floors have a balcony. Coin laundry machines are located on three of the floors and are $2.00 for the washer and $2.00 for the dryer. Detergent is automatically dispensed with a push of a button. They offer transportation to and from the cruise port. I believe it's $10.00 a person for a round trip ride. They also charge a fee to leave your vehicle here if you leave it while you take a cruise. Overall a nice place to stay.

It had too much information on one screen that only one person at a time could manipulate. An app or 3 mini kiosk would've been better. It wasn't until half way through my trip, that I came upon the Traveler Information Center by the vending machine. Why is this not by the GoBoard? I loved the Cocoa Beach map and would've appreciated receiving this when the desk clerk learned I was there for pleasure. There is a section of the Business Center called \"Boarding Pass\" with two computers that only do flight check ins! Pretty cool! The walk to the beach from exit door to sand is 3 minutes max! Signage is minimal, so my advice is to exit by the Meeting Rooms, not the pool. There is not much to do in Cocoa Beach, but I really liked that I had multiple dining options within walking distance!

Now the beach access which it shares with the Hampton Inn next door is convenient but it is a long winding trail of about 1/4 mile, it is lighted at night but it is long when it is hot and when you walk back up it is uphill all the way. The pool is big, and there is a Jacuzzi which I reveled in and a lot of seating on the deck. It even has a fire pit! for cooler nights. I found the bathroom and vanity areas too small. but the rest of the hotel makes up for it. The food in their bistro area is very very good but a little high. For a hotel that really isn't upscale in an area where upscale is a foreign word, this one is really worth the moderate price..

Nice rooms & private balcony. Great for watching the July 4th fireworks on the beach. I didn't like the fact that the sink & vanity were outside the bathroom.

We were on the 5th floor above the treetops. There is a private path to get to the beach, but my husband has several disabilities, one with breathing & he would have never made it. Once on the beach you could rent a lounge chair for $10 even for a couple hours, 2 chairs & beach umbrella for $49.. I was told no discounts as it was a holiday weekend. There were no umbrellas to rent so settled on lounge chairs. The pool towels @ the hotel are really little, so if possible bring your own beach towels. The pool area was nice. The hotel lobby was modern & plenty of seating. Starbucks isn't a \"real\" Starbucks they just brew their coffee & can't make any special drinks. Breakfast was expensive, should provide a continental breakfast for free or minimal charge. It makes it so convenient. Very difficult to get luggage carts. We waited about 45mins for checkout cart.
