From the moment you arrive until you leave the Riad, the staff accommodate your every need. My wife and I recently spent five nights at the Riad and couldn't have been more pleased with the service provided by the entire staff, especially Irsham and Mustafa. After having a flight cancelled due to a protest/strike by Royal Air Maroc, these gentlemen welcomed us back to the riad, without a reservation, and worked feverishly to help us resolve our issues and book a new flight for the next day. The Riad is the picture of relaxation and tranquility just a few blocks from the hustle and bustle of the souks. The rooms are comfortable and decorated in traditional Moroccan trim. The staff provide excellent recommendations about sights/ restaurants/events to enjoy. We will definitely return to Riad Les Trois Palmiers!", "title": "Hospitality beyond measure!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "chrisparker72", "date": "April 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 106095700}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Besides a minority of guests, I see a real waste of superlative adjectives for this riad. And actually I selected it for the expectional wonders described here on tripadvisor, but after having seen the riad and lived there...well, I do not know whether these people is ingenuous, or has hearing and/or olfaction problems, or simply gets enchanted by some stylish piece of furniture. Probably most people tends to convince themselves that they had an incomparable vacation, in any case. I do not want ti be misunderstood: the riad is very good from many point of views, first of all the rich breakfast, the kindness of the staff, and the position, but absolutely out of standard (talking about quality/price ratio) from other points of view. Which ones? For instance, our bathroom emanated an intense sewer stink (and it was not a matter of the days I stayed there, since there was an electric perfume permanently plugged in the wall socket) that reached the sleeping area, the shower sink did not work properly, the blankets were never changed in 6 days (and were not exactly snow-white). But the most annoying for us was the noise made by the other guests after dinner: we never managed to close our eyes before 12.30 AM: laughs and screams of excited guests (probably those that then write excellent reviews) in one case lasted until 1 AM, without that nobody invited them to keep quiet (or to go back to Jemaa el Fna). And sometimes the show started again in the morning, when some guest decided to have breakfast in the court at 8 AM (not exactly the top, after having been waked up by the muezzin at 5.30 AM - but this is just normal). I understand that hearing other people is unavoidable in a structure like that of a riad, but exactly for this reason the owners should impose clear and simple rules to be absolutely respected by their guests. I was in similar structures and this did not happen, and it is not a matter of higher standard, but of good sense. After two nigths, I explained the situation to one of the guys of the staff, and he told me that the guests were invited to keep silence after 11 PM, but the night after the show continued. I thought I had reached a solution after having talked directly to one of the most screaming ladies, but evidently other guests joined that same day to make my effort vain. And the truth is that I was not advised of this \"rule of silence\" when I checked in, so I guess nobody is. Concerning the terrace, it is really very beautiful. But please people, do not exaggerate: other three friends of ours were in Marrakech in those same days in other riads in central position, so we could visit their places. They spent less than us and in their terraces they could even had a bath in a sort of Jacuzzi. In conclusion, I believe this is a nice and comfortable riad, but really overrated: if you want stay here at all costs, probably the best choice in terms of quality/price ratio is asking for the cheapest (and smallest) rooms on the roof, that are likely also those less affected by noise.", "title": "good, but nothing exceptional (as many people seem to believe)", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "lufa", "date": "April 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 105965736}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Riad Les Trois Palmiers and highly recommend it.
