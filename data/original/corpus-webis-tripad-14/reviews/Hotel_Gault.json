The hotel is clean and modern, but still feels comfortable and romantic. Although the hotel was completely booked the weekend we stayed, it never seemed crowded or busy; a feeling of relaxed (but hip!) elegance was maintained at all time. We stayed in an \"Essential\" room, which is the least expensive, but the room was plenty big. No dressers, though, so prepare to keep your clothes on shelving. The shower was wonderful, big with great pressure. The breakfast is amazing: plentiful and delicious, with hot items cooked to order. The hotel is located in a quiet part of Old Montreal. It is a mostly business district so on the weekends it is very peaceful and private, yet the bustle of the more touristy section of Old Montreal (which we pretty much avoided) is only a few blocks away, as is the nearest Metro station.

We stayed in a Studio, one of the largest options. Very clean, extremely modern. We are not modern furniture people but felt it would be fun for a change. If you are really into this type of look, this place would be fantastic for you. Lots of new stuff but also valuable stuff from the 40's-50's and 60's. The bed is incredibly comfortable. We loved our bathroom (which for us included a tub) Our studio had a mini fridge, wet bar and microwave. The living area was seperated from the bedroom by a custom built wood piece which did not reach the ceiling, but was really more of a divider. The TV/DVD was located on that, on a swivel that could face either room area. If you want something supremely cushy and comfy, this is not your place. OUr studio was wonderful but not the most Cozy thing we have stayed in. Having said that, it was fun to 'try something different on' since we are huge antique people. The lobby is terrific. Neat bar and surrounding area. Breakfasts were very good, and we found that we ordered the hot breakfast items every morning. Service very gracious there, expecially if you remember that although it is 'free', the server deserves a tip. Things were replenished regularly. The Gault is on the edge of Old Montreal- get your bearings so you don't miss the busier streets of Old Montreal. The staff was enormously friendly. Also, take the hotel's address and number with you if you are taking cabs. Not all of the drivers have discovered the Gault yet. We LOVED Andre. He has genuine passion for the hotel and the area. But all the front desk/concierge folks were very professional and friendly and helpful. We had no problems with housekeeping. Left our room, put out the sign and when we came back it was all set. It's true they don't change the linens every day but why tax the environment with the extra soap and hot water. If we threw towels on the floor, they were replaced. If we hung them, they were not. Fine with us. We ordered drinks and apps room service- quick and efficient. Husband forgot his razor, brought one up.

The public spaces had both a rarefied and inviting openness about it with clever combinations of warm blond wood and tin ceiling and concrete walls, with wonderful displays of modernist art and whimsical but perfectly comfortable furniture. Our Extraessentiel room with its high ceiling was huge, and the bathroom with its separate tile & glass shower and its separate tub was also spacious --approaching the size of an entire hotel room in some cities! The bed and bed and bath linen were all plush and of excellent quality. The decor was minimalist and stylish, with use of warm colors. Service was exceedingly nice and attentive. The bountiful breakfast service with an abundant variety started at 6:30, with coffee and espresso made to order. The location in Old Montreal was charming with small restaurants and coffee shops nearby while being a little away from the heavier tourist traffic; it took us about 20 minutes on foot to get to Centre Ville for our work-related meeting, which made for a nice and enjoyable way for us to see the street and sidewalk culture of both sides of Montreal.

This is one mod little hotel that earns its good reviews. This boutique property is fun, stylish, well located for leisure visitors, and unlike so many other trendy hotels of the moment, it hits on all the key hospitality cylinders without a single backfire. Our room was spacious, with an extra comfy kingsize bed and a rollaway for junior. The design element is big here, so if you like modern, the Gault is going to be to your taste. Minimalist decor, but cozy and bright. Breakfast is a treat as many other reviewers have noted. Service is attentive and friendly, but not obtrusive. The Gault pays attention to all the little details that can make or break a hotel stay. It is consistently just a little better than you might expect and the knowledgeable staff pulls it off with composure and elan. Highly recommended.", "title": "Vive le Gault", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "ChiveTidbits", "date": "August 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3760327}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The creme de la creme!", "text": "This was one of our best hotel stays ever.
