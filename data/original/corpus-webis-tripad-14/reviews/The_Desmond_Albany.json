The main restaurant, Scrimshaw, has nice decor and offers great service and even better food. There is a less fancy restaurant which is also good, especially for breakfast. Rooms overlooking the indoor courtyard are best. One big minus is that there are often weddings, business meetings which seem to take over the complex at certain times. This can be very annoying.

The food portions are HUGE and the quality can be great - or just tasty but lacking in veg. Breakfast starts at 7 and there's no grab-a-yoghourt-and-go - but there is a Starbucks in easy walking distance if weather is clement. Internet access is now available but, if without own machine, in-room in-tv is far too expensive and cumbersome so use the (small) business centre. If mobility is a problem, let them know as the walk to the back rooms is more of a hike than a walk. Also, ask if you wish to be put somewhere away from the participants in weddings and bar mitzvahs - the public rooms are well sound-proofed but the corridors are not.
