The staff could not have been more helpful. Before we got to Sicily we had to notify them of 3 transfer changes - due to air strikes in Milan. We ended up cancelling all transfers and got a taxi at PMO - arriving at 1:30 am. We had a big, comfortable, quiet room. The next morning we had a great breakfast and a good bit of assistance planning our day. The night we returned to the Tonic, we had a beautiful room and were greeted early in the am with packed breakfast to take to the airport.

The first night's stay was very good. However, when we came back at the end of our tour around Sicily, the room we were assigned was not very good. The room itself (#406) was large and nice, but the king-size bed was very uncomfortable. It didn't really have a mattress on it, only a box spring with a very thin layer of \"mattress-covering\" on top of it. The hotel was full, so they could not move us to another room, but promised they would the next day. I slept on the twin-sized bed in the corner which was OK, and my husband tried to get some sleep on the larger bed. It was an uncomfortable night for him. They did move us the next day to another room (#403), which was very comfortable. The hotel has a great location, and it's easily walkable to many sites. Breakfast was very good and had a good variety. Staff was friendly.", "title": "Large rooms, good location", "user": "islandreams", "date": "October 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 182001923}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not great.
