The shower, very large and well-appointed, has glass walls that are perfectly kept. I don't know how the housekeeper did it but there wasn't a water mark anywhere.

There's no concierge. That's okay, except that the very friendly front desk and front door staffs are not up to advising tourists. The hotel management is missing a step here. The Westin should provide pre-printed directions to major tourist sites (for example, the Japanese Gardens), directions that have correct information about public transportation. And the Westin needs to subscribe to some sort of \"clipping service\" that would help keep the staff informed. For example, we had booked a table at Ava Gene's. Why? It was both in the NYTimes travel section (July 2013) and selected as one of the ten best restaurants in America by Bon Appetit (August 2013).
