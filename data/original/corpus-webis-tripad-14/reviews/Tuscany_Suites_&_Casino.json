Didn't realize until after booking that it was Superbowl weekend....strip very crowded. This is a nice place, more resort looking with individual 3 story buildings. Reminded me of a timeshare.

Unfortunately, it was in the \"south 40\" as the farthest building from the lobby, pool, casino... We didn't really care but when we got to the room the door wouldn't open. The light was green but no matter how hard we pushed it was like it was dead bolted from the inside. So we decided to hoof it back to the lobby. We told the front desk lady that the door wasn't opening and told her it was like someone might still be in there. She said that she would send security with us back to the room?!!!!!??? I told her that \"no I dont' think so and that I shouldn't be subjected to confronting someone who might still be in the room\"! In any case, we asked to be moved up closer to the lobby and that we would be back in the afternoon to check it. We walked to Ballys (strip)...not too bad for 2 blocks. Ballys had pretty loose slots. I hit $260 quarter jackpot...not too bad for the first 10 minutes I was there. After Bally's, Paris and Excalibur, we made our way back to the Tuscany to try and get our room. They were able to accomodate us in the \"H\" building, which is the one directly behind the pool and closest to lobby, resturants, bar and casino. We had a good view of the pool and grounds. Rooms very spacious. The room had 2 queens and was supposed to be a couch bed but wasn't so they sent up a roll away at no charge. There was a refrigerator and coffee maker but no microwave. I'm sure they would of sent one up if we asked because I think the rooms are supposed to have them. Since we only were here for 2 days, didn't bother asking. All in all, I would stay here again.
