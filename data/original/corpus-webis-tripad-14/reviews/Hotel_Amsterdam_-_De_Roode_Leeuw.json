Like some people have said, the rooms are small but ideal for one person. They are very clean and serviced everyday. I made good use of my room whilst staying here, the room enabled me to have some \u2018me\u2019 time during a very long tradeshow in the city. (the shower was amazing!) The room had a very well stocked mini bar and a room service menu which again I made good use of. The food arrived with 15 minutes and it was lovely! The food in the restaurant of the hotel was again really lovely and quite reasonably priced. I heard a few people in my party complain about the breakfast, powdery scrambled eggs, no fried eggs etc. I however thought the breakfast was great, selection of hot and cold to suit everyone.

The sign at the front desk indicated that anyone caught using drugs onthe premises would be prosecuted immediately and the police would be called. I thought that was interesting. The hair dryer in the room was definitely from the 1950s - you had to be a little on the tall side to manage it since it was a hose that came out of a box on the wall.
