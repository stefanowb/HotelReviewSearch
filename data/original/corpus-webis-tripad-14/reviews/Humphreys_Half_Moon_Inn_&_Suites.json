(Between the hotel room and the harbour was the hotel parking lot, a street and a park parking lot, so you are not next to the water). Overall it was not the view we envisioned. The suite design was strange. The bed was located very close to the entrance door, and we had the privilege of overhearing several late night boisterous conversations in the hallway. Indeed the basics are there, a sitting room with a hard sofa bed, clean bathroom, a fairly clean room and a filty outdoor deck. The hotel is of course close to the water and waterfront park.So if you like to go for walks near the ocean it is a good location. However eating options (other than the hotel) are a bit of a walk from the hotel. Overall, if you are in San Diego to see the zoo, sea world and the wild animal park, it is better to find a lower cost hotel with safe clean rooms rather than one that also includes tropical ambience since since you would not likely take much advantage of the grounds the hotel has (for which you pay).", "title": "Overrated", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "dkona", "date": "December 24, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4299260}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Fair not great", "text": "We stayed 2 nights at Humphrey's.
