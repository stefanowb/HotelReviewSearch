Worse, he let us know that because we were only staying 2 nights, we were bumped for another guest who was staying longer. Seriously? In fairness, he had booked us a room elsewhere.

For all these reasons, I endorse the positive reviews that the hotel usually gets. My one gripe is that, as a regular visitor, I feel a bit frustrated by the lack of variety. Breakfast at the hotel has remained unchanged for the four years that I have visited. Despite my hints, fruit has never made it onto the array of choices. Individual staff members know my preference for fruit, and are kind enough to bring in the odd banana if they remember.

The room was a decent size even considering European rooms are smaller than American rooms. The bathroom was bit smaller but nice. The staff at the hotel was simply amazing. Every front desk member spoke English and was friendly and helpful every time I saw them. The location is perfectly located in the district of Saint Germain near the thriving Rue de Buci where you can find the best food, shopping, and cafes within a block or two. Highly recommend dining at Chez Fernand for an authentic French cuisine experience at a good price for amazing food. It's walking distance to the Musee de Louvre, the Cathedral de Notre Dame, or two Metro stations that can get you anywhere in the city in 15 minutes. Only suggestion and it's minor, you have to reenter the username and password every time you want to connect to the WiFi. If you want that impersonal sterile brand new hotel experience go elsewhere.
