It was exactly right, everyone and everything was wonderful. We were staying with family on the Kona side in a resort. Resorts or nice, but they are not exactly our style. My husband and I wanted a night away, somewhere quieter and more natural. This was perfect! It's not exactly luxurious, but it is very nice and comfortable, and the setting is absolutely amazing! So beautiful and wild, it feels like you are in the middle of nowhere but it's actually only a couple of miles to town. An easy drive to come and go for dinner, etc. The website doesn't even do it justice, there's no way to show that the falls are RIGHT outside your room! Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, and Leah was wonderful company :) We stayed in the Maile Room in Harmony House, the room is pretty small but you won't care. It's probably the most private room in the Inn, upstairs and on the outside edge of the property.
