Our room was large and clean with lots of extra towels and a comfy bed. We both enjoyed the breakfast, which was an expanded continental (waffles, fruit, & egg dishes in addition to the typical cereal, juice, bagels & muffins). There was a small exercise room and a big indoor pool with whirlpool. The staff was friendly and helpful; the public areas were spotless; the parking lot was well-lit. There are 5 or 6 restaurants within 1/2 mile, a huge shopping center, and only 5 miles from Plymouth Harbor. We visited Boston and paid less than half the price of a room in the city.
