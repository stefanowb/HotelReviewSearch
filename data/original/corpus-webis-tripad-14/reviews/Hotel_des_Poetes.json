We weren't disappointed. The hotel is in the centre of the city, faces onto a lovely and large municipal garden and is only a couple of minutes' walk from the railway station. Our room, on the 2nd floor, was neat, clean and had a roomy balcony terrace (albeit without a view). The price was very reasonable and, if we'd been willing to lug our bags up to the 4th floor, we could have had a room for 45 euros. The decoration is bright and cheerful and the welcome we received was very friendly. The nearby garage was perfect for storing our tandem bike (there seemed to be plenty of room for cars). We needed to leave the bike until the following afternoon; this was fine with the proprietors, who even loaned us a key to the garage since they expected to be away when we needed to collect our bike.", "title": "Really enjoyed our stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dg74", "date": "April 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127290713}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Having now read some other reviews of the hotel, I would have to agree with some comments, e.g., there isn't a lift, the rooms are simple.
