There was no closet and only 2 small drawers in the bedside table. There were hooks on the wall that we used for our jackets. A simple breakfast is served every morning and coffee, toast and hot water are available 24 hours. They also have WIFi and two computers available for use in the small common area.

When we finally make it to the top of the hill with our bagages, and are faced with the third revelation: The room. The room itself is quite horrible... The walls are extremely dirty (see pictures), there are ant problems in the washroom (on the sink), a lot of mould and mildew in the room and the washroom, not to mention the shower curtain incrusted with mold. The bed sheets were dirty (blood stains, among other stains), and the walls are filled with bug juice (spots of old bug blood).
