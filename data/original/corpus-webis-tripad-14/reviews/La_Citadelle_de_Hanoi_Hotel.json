Its right in the thick of Old Hanoi and very clean, with the most accomodating staff you could ask for. Having very little knowledge of Vietnam, the staff made sure we were not overcharged for any extra tours, and even saved us money on some of them. A word to any traveller going to Vietnam, accept their customs, be very polite and laugh a lot, and dont let things like animals that are sometimes in restaurants and hotels be of a bother. Its all part of their way of life and is what makes this country so special.", "title": "This is the place to stay.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "aussies5", "date": "November 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10991104, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 n/a"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Great Place to Stay!!", "text": "We came across quite a number of europeans who made us feel very ashamed of the way they treated the vietnamese, expecting everything to be the same as in their \"first world\" countries.

Whilst there were no issues with our airport transfer, we were subsequently shown to a room which was much less than we expected. The bathroom was dark, with poor lighting, watermarks down the walls of the room itself, dirty linen on beds and virtually no security from the street, unlike other hotels in the vicinity which have manned front doors. Whilst the hotel also boasted in-room internet facilities, the connection itself was poor. We decided to move immediately to a nearby hotel which was cheaper, clean, well staffed, secure and excellently run.
