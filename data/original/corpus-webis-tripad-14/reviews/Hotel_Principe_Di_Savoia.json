I would like to especially recognize the competent, eager and friendly concierge staff - though truly every staff member at Principe di Savoia is completely on their game. The valet team is particularly strong as well. Beautiful rooms, a fine location - simply perfection. And, yes, the service has everything to do with it.

I stayed there during the winter sales, and Milan as well as the Principe di Savoia was overrun with nouveau riche shoppers from Eastern Europe. Staff throughout my stay were very friendly and helpful, whether the receptionists at check-in, the gym or the staff at breakfast. The room was fresh and very nicely appointed, with lovely soft furnishings, a marble-clad bathroom and great toiletries. If I had to criticise anything, it would perhaps be that the mattress and pillows were too firm for my taste. Very elegant foyer and restaurant. The breakfast buffet was very good, with a wide choice and quality ingredients. The gym and pool area on the top floor was also great. It's an easy 10 minute walk to the shopping area and centre, but I used the limousine service a few times, which was very convenient.
