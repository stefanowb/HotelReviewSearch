Her beautiful house has alot of history and around every corner it bellows a warm welcome and beautiful interior. Each room has its own name and design, one feels like you have stepped back in time for a moment to proper hospitality the way it should be. On waking each morning, you are greeted with an Irish breakfast that is made to your taste, beautiful organic menu full of produce from Ireland and the family farm, to tempt the taste buds. Joan herself will sit down for a chat, and on arriving back home in the evening you are greeted with a warm cup of tea and what ever yummy treats she has freshly cooked that day. The surrounding gardens have a wild character and one can stroll down to the river, sit in the warm sunshine and switch off. After returning to normal life, we certainly felt relaxed and spoiled.
