We were in town for graduation at Naval OCS and chose the property for its proximity to the Pensacola Naval Air Station. In truth, the 11 miles or so to the station is a long haul with an endless array of traffic lights. Plan on 30 minutes or longer! This is a newer property, which was full while we were there (March 8 - 10, 2006). The breakfast area is very spacious so that there is not a \"crush\" in the morning. Rather than serving the generic fruit of \"melon cubes\", packed in an odd tasting \"whatever\", found at so many Hampton Inns, this site offers fresh segments of oranges & grapefruits. The layout of the food items is very spacious. One does not have to \"rub elbows\" with one's fellow travellers. As we finished breakfast, one of the staff offered us small boxes of mints. What a nice touch! On our second morning we left at 4:45 a.m. to participate in the 5:25 a.m. morning run at naval OCS. The breakfast go bags were waiting at the desk for early departures. I wish this had been the case in San Francisco when we had an early flight to catch.
