Located just minutes away from the medieval walled city of Avignon, the farmhouse and other connected buildings are situated in the middle of several acres of open fields and wooded glens. The rooms ooze a historical past yet are very cozy, clean and well appointed (not to mention quite spacious!) Each morning was a delightful time to visit with Francoise and Paco over breakfast and they were quite earnest in learning the interests of all their guests and making helpful suggestions for day excursions. Our interest was ancient Roman ruins and wine tasting and there was plenty of each to explore within an hours circumference of Avignon.
