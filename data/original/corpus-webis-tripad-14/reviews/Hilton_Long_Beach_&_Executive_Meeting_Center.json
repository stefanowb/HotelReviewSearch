We arrived 2/19 between 2-3pm and found our room ready. We stayed 2 days in Room 921. The Lobby is very nice and our check-in was quite easy with the staff being very friendly and helpful. The desk clerk gave us a map of the area and told us where the best self parking was for our room. Self Parking is still at $17/day and Internet access is $9.95/day. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Liked the fact that we could open the window for fresh air. The TV was nice, with HBO, Current movies (still in theaters) available for a fee, also Account and Checkout Access via remote. Speaker phones, refrigerator, coffee machine, safe, ironing board and iron, hairdryer and bathroom amenities were welcomed. Restaurant seemed pricey and found it difficult to find fast food or grocery store without traveling to older part of town. We were hoping to grab the shuttle to the aquarium the following day to avoid more parking charges, but were told the shuttle would not return until after 3:30pm that day. We parked for $8 at the aquarium. Overall we had a great time even though the hotel is more fitting for business. Upon arriving home we discovered we had left a small suitcase in the closet. We called the hotel and left our number and were told that \u201clost and found\u201d would be returning our call. A very nice woman from lost and found called us back promptly. She described our lost suitcase and informed us that we could have it mailed to us. After taking down our credit card info I asked her to mail it \u201cregular mail\u201d (hoping it will be less than the gas back and forth). So now I guess we'll wait and see. Will post again if there is a problem with the luggage return. Feeling like such a fool right now. Never left luggage before. Anyway I would highly recommend this hotel when visiting Long Beach!..........Vincent Russell", "title": "Great stay even after left suitcase!!", "user": "vinsheer", "date": "February 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 152749549}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Evaluating strictly from a business stay perspective with HHonors Diamond perspective, meaning I don't care about things like valet, bell or concierge service but do care about a few other critical items.", "title": "Business stay evaluation", "user": "medwonk", "date": "February 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 152589192}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Positives:", "title": "Excellent hotel, great for the price", "user": "Emily R", "date": "February 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0}, "id": 152178500}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled on business", "text": "1.
