Room was very cold at first however it was December my husband sorted the radiator out by letting some air out and the room soon warmed up . Lovely view from our room , as it was December we were the only guests at this hotel , small very quiet village I guess it's a lot bussier in summer . Lovely owners , more than adequate breakfast. Very nice . We did dine on the first evening meal was good . I did feel that the room lacked any character it's basic white wash of walls ceiling made it sort of clinical looking however very clean . We only stayed 2 nights although we paid for 3 we didn't mind paying as it was our decision to leave . It adjust a little too quiet . Village very small and pretty nice if you want a complete retreat from the usual busy spots .", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "UkSand", "date": "December 29, 2012", "id": 148271402}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "was there in september 2012, very nice hotel, beautiful view, graphic village excellent place to spend a few days in relaxing mode... .good breakfast buffet, clean rooms,value for money need a few more signs to find it though. has a few signs in the village no trouble there but before that was a bit hard in finding it.", "title": "great little place", "user": "Karagiannis_George", "date": "October 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144009144}], "location": {"country": "Cyprus", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Dhrousha"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 2, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 5}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
