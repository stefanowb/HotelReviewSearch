We hired Siesta Key Events and one of their preferred vendors was Tropical Breeze Resort. After reading the terrible reviews on the internet, I was very sceptical to book all 20 people that were joining us. I was reassured by Tammie from Siesta Key Events, that many of their brides have booked there and were happy. She was right! I couldn't have been more happy with our decision and her recommendation. We stayed in The honeymoon suite (114). It was HUGE. More than enough space. Our 16yr old and 4yr old boys had room 108. Our 21yr old and 19yr old daughters (and 2 boyfriends) stayed in 109. A little small for 4 adults but totally worked. My mother and stepfather stayed in 101, the best room of all the 1 bedroom resort suites (I think). They gave us a break on rooms, and our honeymoon suite that was at least 4x the size was the same price as the rest! The free breakfast in the morning isn't much, but it's not worth talking about here. There are 3 pools on the property. all clean but on the small side. The location is phenomenal!!!! We will definitely be returning!!! I can't rave enough about how perfect it was for our guests.

We stayed in room 164, which was a little efficiency that opened up to a tropical courtyard. The room was clean and the front-office staff were very friendly. We acted like tourists, taking advantage of the short walk to the beach and all of the festivities that Siesta Key Village has to offer.

They are very low maintenance middle class people from the middle of Oklahoma and normally stay at Extended Stay or Best Western. They booked a room for two nights but left after the first, cutting our visit short because this hotel was so filthy. The kids' feet were black within the first 10 minutes of walking around the room which was a suite with a kitchen. There were pubic hairs stuck on the bathroom door which was right in your face when using the restroom. The fold out couch was so hard and thin that my six year old nephew wouldn't sleep on it because the springs poking through hurt so bad. The sheets kept popping off the mattress, had holes in them and the blanket they brought had a hole in it. The bathroom door could only be opened halfway before hitting the bed. My 90 year old grandmother, who was staying in a seperate room couldn't wash her hair because the shower was a \"trickle\". The ammonia odor was so strong, we smelled it before we opened the door to her room and it was sickening once inside. My sister was in room 109 which cost $167 after taxes for one night and my grandmother in 119 for $132.

The hotel staff was friendly and very quick to meet our needs. The continental breakfast was a little disappointing....juice/coffee and muffins. We grabbed muffins for snacks and went next door to the Broken Egg for a full breakfast. The hotel itself is really quaint. The screened in patios were really nice, especially for our two little dogs. The suite was a little cramped on room.
