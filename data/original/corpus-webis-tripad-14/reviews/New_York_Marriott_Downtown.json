What an amazing feeling I got walking into the lobby of this hotel! From the bell staff to the receptionists, everyone greeted me with a big smile and such professional personal service - I was made to feel like the most important VIP in the world! An illusion of course, but what a wonderful fairytale! I don't know how they do it, but they make you feel like the only person in the hotel! Even when I called down for a wake up call, the lady on the other end said \"by the way - happy birthday!\" I spent the first three days of my holiday in New York in a daydream (then I moved to a hotel in midtown manhattan to be close to fifth avenue, I'd planned this in advance). The secret of this hotel is all in the attention to details... the box of chocolates handed to me as a gift to mark my 30th birthday upon check-in, the complimentary cheese and wine plateau delivered to my room on my last evening with a handwritten card thanking me for staying in the hotel, and wishing me a great rest of the holiday (I thought that was a very special touch, and added to the magic of that eveing!), the housekeeping manager - Larry, who came to check the work of the housekeeping staff when I had a (very small) problem with the bath one day - the response to my phone call was immediate, and he was a very warm, kind character and very proffesional, as were all the housekeeping staff - the room was not just beautifully clean, but they always had a smile for me in the mornings! This really adds the 'feel-good factor' to your day. And everytime I requested something, it was dealt with efficiently (and I am a very demanding guest!) And attention to detail in the rooms was amazing: the beautiful array of quality bath soaps and conditioners (bath and body works) and the gorgeously decorated bathroom, and of course the most gorgeous harbour view imaginable - statue of liberty, ellis island, brooklyn bridge, and if this wasn't enough, since I had been upgraded to a corner room I had a second window looking into downtown Manhattan (see photos - unfortunately, my mobile phone camera didn't do the views justice - the view from the harbour window was panoramic, and one photo couldn't convey anything close to the real beauty of these views). One word of warning though - the bed is sooooooo seriously comfortable, you won't want to leave it... and on the last day, I finally gave in, and I didn't - I stayed in it ALL DAY! Well, it was sunday, and this hotel is perfect for that lazy sunday feeling... And you can pamper yourself until the cows come home in this hotel too, no need to go anywhere else - there's a hotel massage service, a wonderful room service menu, in-room movies service (if the numerous channels aren't enough for you!), an evening turn down service (with two quality boxes of chocolates), a good size swimming pool and luxurious gym (with free ipod loan), free fruit and water all day, and plenty going on in the hotel - it has a magazine and goodies shop, starbucks, and two really friendly bar/restaurants to choose from (I tried out both and had two lovely nights out there, and as a single woman on my own I felt perfectly safe and welcome)... But to be honest, I spent most of my hours spent there lying in bed and watching the massive ships come in and out of harbour, and I nearly cried at the beauty of the most amazing sunsets over the harbour. A truly magical view. And to top it all off, you get the sense that the people that work here really care about their hotel as well. It feels like a grand boutique hotel, not a chain. The guys on the door have been working here for years and have great stories to tell. Dave is great - he's one of the security guards there, and a real New Yorker! He made me feel right at home! Each and every member of staff makes the effort to recognise you and give you a friendly greeting every day - as I say, you feel like a VIP of the hotel rather than just another guest. The breakfast is very good, though expensive, it is worth trying one day just for the hash browns and poached eggs (I'm missing them already!), though I have to say I didn't like the food in the restaurant 'Roys' in the evening very much - it's not bad, just a bit fancy-french style, fussy, and way over-hyped for the price. But the staff in the restaurant were so friendly and professional, I felt like I was paying for the service and ambiance as much as for the food, so I didn't resent paying so much. If you're looking for a special, romantic and memorable break in New York, this hotel is the perfect place! They really look after you - american style (it has to be seen to be believed - I've never experienced anything like it in Europe. Here you feel like a real client, that your custom is valued). It is great used as a base for visiting New York as well - there is not so much to do in the area, although there are beautiful harbour walks to be had, but soho's so close if you take a cab. The subway was too far away for me at night time - even though it felt like a safe place at night, I wouldn't have ventured off on my own anytime after 10pm, if it wasn't in a taxi. But this hotel is full of cinema-type New York fantasy and will bring something very special to any holiday. Yes, it's old, as some people have mentionned in their reviews, and is currently undergoing a make over, but the 'oldness' gave my room charm and history and was more 'antique' than 'worn', more 'elegant eldery gentleman' than 'tired old man', and certainly more 'nineteen fifties New York' than 'big modern and pretentiously flashy', and its age only adds to its grandeur, in my opinion. And I never had to wait for the lifts (and I was on the 34th floor!) All this, and I paid less than 200 usd per night (it's cheaper at weekends and at this time of year, and I booked early and got a pre-paid rate on the marriott website - but still, what a bargain)! I wanted to make my 30th birthday treat really special, and I certainly got what I came for! I have very fond memories of my stay in this hotel, and will treasure them fondly for many years to come.
