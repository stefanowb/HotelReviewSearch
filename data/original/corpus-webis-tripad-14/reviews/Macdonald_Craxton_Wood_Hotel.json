It was a very well appointed room, with a large bathroom and lots of natural light. The sheets were spotless, as was the bathroom which had lovely Arran Aromatics soaps and shampoos. We had a very comfortable stay for three nights - the bed was huge and very comfortable. The room was not too warm, a problem which I have found in hotels previously.
