We went up to our room which was okay, but had a very strong mildew smell. The bed was VERY comfortable, but the bathroom was very small. The TV was also almost comical it was so small in such a large armoire. The restaurant was pretty pricey but it was surprisingly really very good for dinner. Then the next morning we went down and our vehicle had been broken into along with 5 others. They managed to take our registration and found our extra house keys. One of the people who had there car broken into from the same area had the same thing taken and a phone call was made to there house around 1:45am to presumably check to see if anyone was home. We were told we needed to call our home town police, as we are from the Phoenix area two hours away, and have someone go change our locks if possible on our house. The hotel ended up giving us one night free out of three after we complained to the desk man. The hotel overall is supposed to be making upgrades, which are needed, and so if you were take away our vehicle experience I would say it was slightly overpriced for the quality of rooms.", "title": "Hotel Okay Security Not", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Taffy24", "date": "April 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 14741881, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beds", "disliked": "\u2014 The parking lot not well lit"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Could have been better for a Hilton", "text": "Not a bad deal if you can get a good price.
