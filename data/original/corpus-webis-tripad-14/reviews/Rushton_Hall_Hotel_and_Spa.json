I had a little bit of a sticky start to my stay in that I don't think they were geared up to someone staying for seven nights on a discounted spa break. I really just don't understand the previous review as my experience was completely different. After explaining that the reduced menu only contained three of each course and that I was there for 7 nights. The staff in the restaurant swung into action. I was told I could order from any menu I so desired including the lunch menu and even if I fancied something else the chef would cook it for me. The food was exeptional, This was reiterated by other diner's comments. The service I received was unsurpassable by ALL members of staff I came in contact with including Reception. On the last weekend of my stay there were 2 weddings, One on the Saturday and the other on the Sunday. You wouldn't have known as the service in the restaurant was exceptional. All of the staff were so friendly in all parts of the hall. The spa treatments I received were superb and very professionally undertaken - best I have ever had and I am a lady 'who does spas'. The manager should only be proud of her staff as they are a very caring, friendly, professional team. Well done Rushton.

The house is taken from a chocolate box. Throughout our stay the staff were very friendly and helpful. Two issues took away some of the veneer for me. The first issue (and a friendly word of advice to the venue) ; On checking in at reception, I was aware that the person waiting behind me to be served was a beautiful bride - for a venue that sells itself as a premium wedding venue I was concerned that the a brid feels the need to go anywhere near to reception to get a snag fixed on her wedding day - surely (as Rushton Hall only does one wedding a day) they should have a dedicated wedding contact available at all times to smooth away those issues. My second issue was the evening meal - we'd prebooked dinner for 8pm - the dinning room was lovely and the staff courteous, and service timely. The quality of the food was mediocre for a premium venue - The pre-booked dinner was \u00a338 a head - but upon seeing the menu, every (decent) dish came at an additional premium - I paid a premium for a Halibut dish - which, when it came was overcooked. I am an unashamed foodie and to see \"seasonal local vegetables\" - turn out to be french beans and the like (in January? in Northamptonshire?). Two other tables nearby also requested additional sauce with their dinner - as it seemed to on ration. Our room was average for the money. The breakfast - 8/10. The Spa 10/10.
