We didn't get any special treatment, never received turndown service, folded fancy towels or any extras like some in our group did, even after a generous tip. Maurice provided great customer service and made us feel welcome and always had a smile on her face. Elvis at the pool bar was amazing. And we LOVED Henry AKA \"Megatron\" (he takes pictures and they are amazing). The Santa Fe was the best meal that we had, the Steakhouse was good as well. The BBQ Buffet was our least favorite. Also note, I ordered a steak at every a la carte restaurant and no matter how it was ordered, it was always well done. Everyone in our party (there were 17 of us) would order them done differently and everyone's looked the same. And the cuts were always just a cheap steak whether it said filet mignon, ribeye, sirloin. Also, we asked ahead of time if premium drinks would be provided (specifically asked about Captain Morgan and were told it was available, but it was not). These however were just minor things in the big picture. I would highly recommend the Saona Island day trip as well. The Caribbean Sea is gorgeous.

But first night me n my fiance arrived with all our friends, we were placed in a double bed room, so was another couple from our group. So we called down and they told us they couldn't do anything about it till the next night. The other couple went down n complained, and they gave them a room with a king size, so we went down to complain and they told us that was not true and they didn't give a king size to anybody, which is really dumb of them to lie, we are all friends we would know. So anyhow they promised us the next night they would give us a king size, the next day we went down, same thing. Nope can't give u a king size, there's none available, so we argued for a bit, finally they put us on a list, eventually we got our room. So our new room, the safe did not work, called down about 3 times still nobody came to fix it, instead the guy starts hitting on me on the phone, i tell him i'm married n he never called back after that or showed up to fix it! The bed was horrible, it drooped in the middle, so even if u have a king size ur still rolling into the middlle of the bed. The toilet seat was missing one of the clips, so when u sat on it, it would swivel not very fun when ur drunk. Well and seeing that this hotel is 18 + up only, you would think they don't have a time u have to be quiet by, obviously lots of seniors!! we would get complaints every night, no matter which room we went too, we had 5 rooms in total. First the guard would knock on ur door, ask u to be quiet, n right after he leaves the phone would ring, n reception would say ur friends have to leave your room. were all in our mid-late twenties, i'm sure we don't need babysitters! Oh and this is the worse ever, even though u lock your room door, any hotel staff has access to enter, i remembered the one night i locked the deadbolt, the next morning we didn't hear the maid knocking, n she walked right in, we said no not right now, she left, and i locked the deadbolt again, thinking i didn't lock it the night before, another maid walked in 1 hr later. So that did not make me feel secure at all! As well every single night we went back to our room, our tv was on, it really creeped me out. I called reception saying i was not complaining, but could u ask the maid to turn off the tv when she is done watching. His reply was maybe she just wants to watch while she cleans, but i told him that was fine, just asked that she turns it off when she leaves. he just said fine i'll write a report on it. The 2nd last day we were there, we were asked to write reviews for the hotel, we had written a complaint about our safe in our room not working, and that nobody attending to it. The morning we were checking out, somebody came to fix our safe, again they had access into our room, even tho we deadbolted it. We told him don't worry about it, we are checking out. 1 hr later somebody walks into our room again wit the deadbolt locked, saying somebody called about the safe? we just told him to leave. Overall the hotel is clean, very well maintained gardens and scenery, and don't get me wrong some of the staff were very nice and polite.

I went with my husband for our honeymoon and we booked through Apple Vacations! When we arrived at the airport, which is like a large size hut, we were greeted with local singers and a had a quick picture snapped which you can purchase later. We rounded up our luggage and were mobbed by men that grab for your luggage to carry them and earn a tip. We found our Apple bus and off we went to the resort. The drive there was quite scary, they drive nuts... and it's very much a third world country. Approximately 45-1hr later we arrived and were pleasantly greeted with smiles, cold towels and cold drinks. We were told it would be about an hour before our room would be available, therefore went to the buffet to eat lunch. When we returned an hour later our room was ready and we were escorted by our personal butler, who also carried our luggage. The grounds are kept emaculate..aside from a couple stray cats roaming around occassionally. Our room was perfect, spacious and clean. We had a garden view; which was okay because a majority of the rooms are garden view; however we were steps from the pool and one of the closest villas to the beach. Don't lose your beach towel becuase, it takes one to have one. You exchange them daily and they are quite strict about losing them. Chairs were readily available by the pool but less available on the beach. Beware of nudity if you have children, there are alot of Europeans, which are not modest to say the least. The pool was very nice and the beaches are breathtaking. Seaweed was cleaned off the beach every morning. The beach bar/ and beach buffet are easily accessed and the food was pretty decent. My only complaint would be the food, it was less than par. It's very bland, with not alot of flavor. Cheese is not pasturized and spices are used very modestly, so most food tastes different. There is alot of selection of food on the buffet and dinner. Staff is very friendly and curteous; everyone always smiled and greeted us. I felt safe on the resort grounds. The shows were really great, shopping was very good, nightlife entertainment was great. We never saw children at our pool or anywhere on grounds, security guards the entrance, and everyone is identified by armbands. It was a very relaxing and pleasant vacation.We went on a snorkeling excursion and it was really good. Not many workers speak english, so there was a communication barrier. There is alot to do throughout the day as well as at night for adults. And we saw children at the other Bahia joined resorts who seemed to be enjoying themselves.
