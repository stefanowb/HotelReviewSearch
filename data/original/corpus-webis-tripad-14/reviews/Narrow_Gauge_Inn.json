We had tried for accomodation in the park but due to the peak season all was booked and by visiting the Tripadvisor website came across this property. As far as location goes, it is a short drive on the main road ( Highway 41) into the Southern park entrance. Located in a lush forest surrounding it is well placed to be able to visit the Mariposa Grove , famous for it Giant Sequoia trees as well as access to the rest of the main attractions in the park. The inn had a very homely feel and although rooms were simple, they were comfortable, clean and had a great wireless internet connection as well as shower and comfortable dressing/bathroom. A wooden deck balcony looked over the lower parking area towards the forest surrounds. The service was very good and I particularly must mention the excellent quality of food and service in the dining room. The reception area has a lovely garden infront and the one can also buy souvenirs at the INN store. As we had 2 nights, we would drive into the park early and return later at night. Bear in mind that there will be a considerable amount of driving involved from the Mariposa Grove to Glacier point and then to Yosemite Village. However is well planned once can get to see all the main attractions in a weekend as we did. I would certainly come back to the Inn again , maybe next time combining it with a night or 2 within the park and closer to Yosemite Village.", "title": "Quaint and comfortable Inn", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "zabo", "date": "October 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 142277416}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The decoration is nice and warm, the outdoor terrain is unnecessary since we came back late.
