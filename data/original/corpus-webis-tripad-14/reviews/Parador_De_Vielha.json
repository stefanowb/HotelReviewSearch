The design is very impressive. The designer has mixed the old with the new: The rooms (ours was probably the smallest) are mostly modern, with grey walls, chestnut wood floors, satin-finish chrome light sconces and waffle-weave cotton bedding with grey wool throws. Evocating the past are white crown molding and a bead-board wall. A lime green modern chair added a bit of color. The large bathroom is of white tile with floor tiles that look like worn leather and a matching wood vanity top. It had a tub and combined shower and a bidet.", "title": "Great views, great design", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BookWriter2", "date": "October 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10072891, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 View, design", "disliked": "\u2014 need to drive everywhere"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We most enjoyed the large sitting area on the ground floor of the parador with views of the entire valley in three directions. (We spend a lot of time here because the wireless internet did not work in our room - by the way, you pay for it in the paradors, 6 euros for 12 hours) It is round, with a fireplace in the middle surrounded by cozy seating areas facing either the fireplaces or the views. This area incorporates many natural materials including tile, wood, marble and stone. It has a few rustic details, such as a set of antlers, but avoids the stereotypes you see in mountain resorts in the U.S. (including log furniture, antler chandeliers, etc.). Here, the designer has combined modern Parsons tables with carved Basque cabinets, a floor of oddly cut tile with a smooth wood ceiling, and other contrasting textures and styles. Hallways too are interesting, with ski pictures in silver frames contrasting with rustic benches and iron wall sconces, and then the surprise of a mid-century drum shade lamp offset on its pole.", "title": "Very disappointing", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Supermercado", "date": "August 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8441248}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "The staff we have dealt with at reception, at breakfast, in the store and ordering drinks have been welcoming in spite of our imperfect Latin-American Spanish. (Oddly, when we tried to change our reservation by one day by email, we were told it was not possible, but when we phoned this parador, they changed it with no problem.) We have also avoided Parador restaurants in general because they seem overpriced. We have been so pleased with the fresh bread, cheese, jamon iberico, and other treats that we can buy throughout Catalan that we have found no need to spend 45 euros a piece on a Parador dinner. We did, however, try breakfast this morning and it was extensive with not only the usual breakfast items (eggs, waffles, cereal, rolls) but with a large selection of hams, including the wonderful jamon serrano, cheeses, quince paste, pizza, make-it-yourself bruscetta (toast, garlic, tomato sauce, anchovies, tuna), fruit tarts, etc. I would have been pleased to have this as a dinner buffet as well.
