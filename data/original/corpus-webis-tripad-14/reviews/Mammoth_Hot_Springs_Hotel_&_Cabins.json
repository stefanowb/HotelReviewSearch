Two rooms, one for parents, one for son. Our room had a very odd smell. It may have been from the new carpet, but we worried that it was a pesticide. We kept windows open (though the low was about 38\u00ba that night) and the furnished desk fan running to keep some fresh air to breathe. The cabin was clean and the mattress was new. As someone else noticed, the sheets are too short for the bed-rather uncomfortable. The shower was very small but worked fine. The view from our area was pretty lame, but no one spends much time in their room at Yellowstone. The furnishings were very dated but everything worked. The main problem with this area is the exterior. The deck that connects the \"cabins\" have not been sealed often enough and are splintering. The redwood stain on the siding is peeling and unsightly. A large group of Asian tourists came to our area later in the evening and I felt bad that this is what we are offering them. What impression are they getting of the US? Xanterra/Park District needs to do basic maintenance even to rustic accommodations. Our next night was at the Old Faithful Inn. It was not much more expensive (shared bath room) and much nicer.
