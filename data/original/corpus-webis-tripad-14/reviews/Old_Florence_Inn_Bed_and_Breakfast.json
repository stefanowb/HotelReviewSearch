It is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at and I have travelled all over Europe, North America and Asia. We booked it because of the reviews on this site. When we arrived we were first surprised that it was on the third floor and the elevators were not readily apparent. We immediately noticed the drilling taking place on the upper floor and we were told it would only take place during the day and we were offered earplugs as a remedy!!!", "title": "Did I stay at the same place as the other reviewers?", "user": "GlobalOttawa", "date": "July 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 8071730, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007", "text": "The triple room we were assigned for three nights stank of cigarette smoke and the lady that was showing us the room denied that there was any smoking allowed in the room. She then showed us a room behing the check in desk which was much nicer, but very, very noisy from the traffic in the very busy street. She could only offer it to us for one night which we accepted as we were very tired. However, the airconditioning in the room was so bad, it might not have existed. There was also no air flow in the bathroom which was just the size of a cupboard. The breakfast tray was the most appalling that I have ever seen with instant coffee power, stale croissants in a packet and other inedible things. We hardly touched it when we checked out the next day by ourselves. There is no one in the hotel early in the morning when we checked out so we just left the keys on the desk and left. The noise from the traffice and police sirens (the area can be nasty at night) kept us up most of the night.", "title": "Charming Old Florence Inn", "user": "DianePittsburgh_PA", "date": "June 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7942388, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The room accommodation with balcony", "disliked": "\u2014 The directions from the train station could have been more exact"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The photos on the wall say that a lot of famous people stayed there, but I find that extremely hard to believe.

It was less than 2 blocks from the train station and heard no noise from the street nor the train station. Florio had been advised of our early check-in but the room was not available. A shower would have been nice. However, the SITA bus station was nearby to catch our bus to Siena. The room was large compared to the room in Rome. The bathroom was clean, the view was average, and the breakfast snacks were sufficient. We met with some friends who live in Florence and they were worried about the XXX Theater a couple of doors down, but the front gates were never opened and may have been shut down. Anyway, this spot was near everything and I am still kicking myself for grabbing that taxi to go to the Uffuzi Gallery. Don't waste the money because the Ponte Vecchio is only a 10-15 minute walk along flat streets. We had a great time and thanks to Florio and his staff there were zero problems.", "title": "Old Florence Inn couldn't have been better", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Dave071", "date": "October 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5933741, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and Service", "disliked": "\u2014 B reakfast"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Old Florence Inn", "text": "Great B& B .Close to everything. reat old fashioned rooms with modern facilities.
