We made no bookings but I found Twin Rivers on my I-fone although their web site interestingly enough isn't I-fone friendly and I couldn't see their street address anywhere! Thankfully Taumarunui isn't big so we found it OK. We were given a newly renovated Studio Unit and for $115 we thought it was excellent value for money, It was spacious enough for two people (particularly just for a one night stay) with full kitchen facilities and a small dining table and best of all, (very unusual for motels throughout NZ) it had a heat pump - thank heavens because it was exceedingly chilly. Well done Twin Rivers for having the heat pumps in your rooms. It was very clean and tidy and we parked right outside the unit.", "title": "Good value for money", "user": "Kathryn O", "date": "May 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 161226303}], "location": {"country": "New Zealand", "region": "North Island", "continent": "South Pacific", "city": "Taumarunui"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 4, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333}
