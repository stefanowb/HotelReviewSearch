The hotel has a rather cramped vehicle arrival space; it is situated on a tight urban site but once inside the lobby is spacious. As Hilton Honours Gold members we were escorted to a separate check in area on the 7th floor (executive level) and upgraded to a suite. The room was spacious and well equipped with some nice touches like fresh fruit and flowers. The d\u00e9cor was a little too fussy and lacked style.
