There are regular tour buses from Singapore that stop at the Hello Kitty Town and LEGOLAND. The hotel is large with 3 building blocks which are connected through walkways on every floor. The room is standard size and the facilities are ok. There are quite some shops on the ground floor - restaurants, Starbucks, drugstores etc. It seems more are to open in the future. A 7-11 type convenience store is next to the entrance. We bought some sandwiches and cakes from the hotel's own shop on the ground floor. The harbor view from the swimming pool area on the top level (4th floor) is quite nice, and the area around the harbor is spacious and walkable. The staff is all courteous and helpful, although some might have limited language skills.There is not much around the area (a few buildings that are still being constructed) and most guests come for the theme parks, but the hotel is a perfect place for relaxation too.", "title": "Convenient and spacious", "user": "lizzylizzy", "date": "January 4, 2014", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 189638937}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Enjoy my stay in this chic hotel.
