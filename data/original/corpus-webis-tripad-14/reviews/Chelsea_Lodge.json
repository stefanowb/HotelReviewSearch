Wonderful location in a quiet Chelsea neighborhood, just a few steps away from plenty of restaurants and shopping. I was very pleasantly surprised given the low price and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a nice budget hotel in Manhattan. Closest subway station is a little over a block away. Staff was friendly and helpful. The entire hotel looks recently renovated. The room was tiny, but it was clean, quiet and - most importantly, had a private shower and sink, which is hard to find in this price range for this type of hotel. The TV didn't work very well but I didn't expect a tv in the first place so it wasn't a big deal. Window opened up to a fire escape overlooking residential courtyard. Each floor has two communal toilets, which were freshly decorated in black and white tile and always immaculate. And each night a hershey's kiss on the pillow was a nice touch.
