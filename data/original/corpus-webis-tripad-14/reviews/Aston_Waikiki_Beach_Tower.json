We are a family of 4 so, i was looking for at least a one bedroom suite that was close to the beach. And of course everything was sold out (well all the rooms at the Waikiki Beach Towers). When i read about the rooms at Waikiki Beach Towers I knew that's where i wanted to stay. So, I narrowed my choices down to the Waikiki Sunset, and the Waikiki Banyan. There where some negative reviews about the Banyan and the Sunset but some good reviews also, so I had a hard time making my decision. My main concern was the distance from the beach. Once i got there I saw that the 2 and 3 blocks that people talked about from the beach and whatever you wanted to do. Was not really that far away. The Banyan and the Sunset are just around the block from the Waikik Beach Towers. And if you are looking at a hotel map, (like i did before going) things look farther away than they actually are. We rented a car for the 6 days that we where there, but never drove to any location in Waikiki. We traveled to other parts of the island in the car. Anyway, my point is: if location is what you are looking for and you want a suite. Don't think that the Banyan and Sunset are too far from the beach because they are not. We paid about $1000.00 more to stay at the Waikiki Beach Towers than we would have paid to stay at the Sunset or Banyan.
