It's twenty mins and I wouldn't advise walking it at night. There are no cafes or restaurants nearby, just residential streets and urban decay. We were given a ground floor room the 1st night, which was so noisy it was untrue. To be fair they did move us to a 1st floor room when we complained but it faced the garden and a barking hound frequently interrupted our rest. When the dog wasn't baying, we were very busy disposing of mosquitoes in our room. I counted ten on the ceiling one night, amid numerous squash stains where previous residents had occasion to battle the insects. The furniture is dated and cumbersome, cue banging your foot or knee off some outsized chair when attempting to navigate your way to the bathroom at night. Staff were so-so, one nice girl at the desk, one very unhelpful gentleman on another occasion. Breakfast was downstairs, zealously watched over by a female member of staff who checked the clock every time one asked for something. Heaven forbid you might overstay the 10.30am limit.

Rooms were cleaned every day and towels changed. The fridge in our room was never working during our stay although reported as such and the extra pillows we asked for never appeared.
