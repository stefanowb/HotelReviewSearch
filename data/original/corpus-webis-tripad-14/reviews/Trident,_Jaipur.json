It's a beautiful hotel - everything is sparkling, clean and in good taste - with terrific views of the old lake palace. Our room was very new and clean, the marble floor was spotless. Waking in a nice comfortable room, watching the sun rise over the lake palace - it's something I'll probably never forget. Also great about the hotel was the service, which was very impressive - extremely prompt and courteous. Some examples: we didn't like the room we got when we first checked it since it had two beds pushed together rather than one so we called the front desk. I barely had a chance to sit down before the very employee who had checked us in at the front desk was at our door with a key to a different room with a bigger bed. Another time, we called laundry to pick up some dirty linens - they were at the door within a minute and a half. All the employees at the restaurant knew what room we were in and addressed us by name, we only had to give our room number once at the beginning of our stay. That said, the main draw of the hotel, the view, is also a drawback. It's a few kilometers out of town and if you don't have a driver with you, it's easy to feel isolated. The hotel has a car service, but it's ridiculously overpriced - I think I remember prices starting at US$20 for an hour or something like that. You can catch rickshaws outside the hotel, but there are only a couple of them available at any time and they will overcharge you by a lot. It's not expensive, but it feels rather silly to pay $5 to ride that uncomfortable contraption for just a couple kilometers. I don't know if there are any regular taxis in Jaipur, but if so, it seems to be hotel policy not to help customers on that issue. Other than that one sour note, it's a terrific hotel.", "title": "Beautiful views, terrific service", "user": "esheng", "date": "January 22, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4370215}], "location": {"country": "India", "region": "Rajasthan", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Jaipur"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 79, "very good": 350, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 517}, "aka": "Trident, Jaipur Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.041095890411}
