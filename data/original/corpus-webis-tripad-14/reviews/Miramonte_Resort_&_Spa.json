We were encouraged by the spa hostess to make use of the amenities such as the warm pool and the jacuzzi, and to even enjoy lunch or a drink on the spa patio. This was a ludicrous suggestion due to the fact that every available seat was taken in addition to an exercise class being taught in the tiny warm pool. We went to the hotel pool while we waited for our treatments, but shrieking children splashing about was not what we had in mind when we booked a relaxing spa day. At the Montage Spa in Laguna, there is a very large pool for spa use only, a good way to have a child-free pool since no one under 16 is allowed at the spa.

Our room air conditioner did not work, refrigerator did not work. After our trip I found out they overcharged my credit card. They authorized my card for hundreds of dollars more then my final bill. The service is atrocious. I now have to dispute authorizations to my credit card. I asked to speak with the general manager of the resort and was sent to his voicemail. He never called me back. They are ripping off customers intentionally.

What is there to do in such a hot place? More than you think! Our teip to the Miramonte with one teenager and a child was AMAZING! The pool is nice and cool! There is plenty of shade and chairs. We ate some food by the pool. They have really, really, really good smoothies! They serve things like salads, hot dogs, hamburgers, usual food you'd see at the hotel pool. It was quite good. They have one resturant, The Grove Artisan Kitchen. They serve Califonia/Italian cuisine. They have a nice kids menu and a wide variety of food on the adults menu. The fitness center is small, but nice. I have been to the spa before and it was the best thing there! The staff was kind and happy to assist you. It is a great spa, and one of the best out there! Across the street they have a golf course, but we did not have the time to go golf. The city has a wide variety of resturants and shops!
