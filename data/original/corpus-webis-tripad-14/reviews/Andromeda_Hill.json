The apartment we had was large, the bed comfortable, the kitchen was fine, lot of places within walking distance to buy stuff for breakfast, dedicated parking underneath. In short, all good. Yes, the band next door did practice, and the church broadcast mass via loudspeakers on Sunday but that is part of the charm. Less charming was the traffic to get to the location and the fact that the office was only open Sun-Thurs business hours, there was no caf\u00e9, although one is promised, and the stairs to the Jaffa port were locked.", "title": "Nice place to stay but not a hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Humphryg", "date": "May 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 159707584}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "There is a church next to Andromeda, and that church is the most noisy place I have ever experienced in my whole life.
