It was a great experience, I'd say out of the blue! Actually, although I was born and brought up in Sicily, I'd never heard about previously...and it's a shame! At our arrival, thanks the warm welcoming we immediately felt at ease. I'd like to mention, particularly, Giuseppe, a very skill guide who led us for a hiking in the forest (60 minutes up hill walk among breath-taking landscapes) and Valeria (who prepared for all of us a jummy and genuine meal). Words can be not good enough in order to describe how exciting is the place and I guess it definitely deserves a stop-over if you come to Sicily and want to experience the happiness to be in touch with nature, between blue sea and green mountains. The fare is absolutely affordable and if you fancy staying for a longtime, you can get the chance to sleep in one of the rooms they've recently renovated in a simple rural style.", "title": "A hidden gem where you can unplug for a while and chill out enjoying the nature", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "GiovanniPalermo", "date": "April 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 156360512}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 3, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 8}, "aka": "Centro Di Educazione Ambientale Serra Guarneri Cefalu, Sicily", "slim_ranking": 0.208333333333, "description": "Serra Guarneri is an Environmental Education Center of the late nineteenth century, renovated, surrounded by a forest of Integral Reserve of Madonie Park.Serra Guarneri is a structure that, with their own space, their staff and their equipment allows visitors to play an emotional experience and relaxing in direct contact with nature.The visitor is immersed in a different environment from the everyday, but at the same time where family can spend a day or more days of relaxation with guided walks in the woods and encounters with ancient masters, where there is a great deal of attention to the welfare of the great and of children with activities and games in nature, where what you eat is genuine, biological and Km 0"}
