Guests can learn to sail at the on-site sailing school, or explore the calm waterways via kayaks, canoes and paddleboats, frequently spotting bald eagles, osprey and herons. The 18-hole Golden Eagle golf course is a pleasantly challenging wooded course with water hazards, and there is also a Par-3 course, tennis, croquet, and spa, plus bicycles for pedaling into town. Our farm-to-table cuisine highlights oysters from the nearby Rappahannock River, and we\u2019re located on the Chesapeake Bay Wine Trail with several Virginia wineries nearby."}
