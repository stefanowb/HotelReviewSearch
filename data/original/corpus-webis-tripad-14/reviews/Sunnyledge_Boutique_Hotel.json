I read the not so good reviews, but thought I'd try it for two or three nights. The location, on Fifth Ave. in Shadyside, is excellent, and I remembered how impressive the converted mansion was. Unfortunately, the property has really gone downhill. My daughter and I walked into a dark, dingy, musty smelling atmosphere. Tables were formally set in the old dining room, but I never saw a person there. The bar, too, did not have a living soul on a stool (to my knowledge) during the 2 nights I was there.", "title": "Great Martini Bar", "user": "rdcjr", "date": "September 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0}, "id": 139815041}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I was 'upgraded' to a larger room.
