We spent 5 nights in the Ocean front room and the rest on the Mountain side. Yes, the Ocean front is very nice and I would take that over the mountain view. The hotel is basic, yet clean and very nice. It has a fun sized pool and is right on the beach. If you get the ocean side you will fall asleep to the sounds of the waves in your ears and by the end of your trip in your heart. It should be noted that this is NOT a Resort per say, and does not compare to the services/rooms offered at the likes of the Four Seasons or any other 5 stars super hotel/true resort. If you need that kind of service you should think about another place to stay and of course pay. However, for the money this place is great. All the rooms come with a small kitchenette which is a nice option for reheating things you may pick up from one of the many great places to eat on the island. The staff is great and let it be known that they are there to help you 24 hours a day. If you book ask for an upper floor room (fifth floor or better) and try to get one that is to the south end of the hotel away from the party/luau that sometimes takes place at a nearby club. ( The party/luau ends at 10 PM so don't worry about being kept up all night) Also the hotel is about a 1/4 mile (15 min walk) from the fun of the beach town called Lahaina which is just the right distance to be. You should however get the rental car. You have parking there at the hotel for 3 dollars a night. I booked a small car via Alamo and was offered a jeep for only 100.00 more at the counter, for a total of 350.00 for 10 days (this would have cost me 650.00 had I booked a jeep on the web) I am told that this, \" we have a special\" thing being told to you at the counter, is very common. Also don't be scared into doing the Hanna highway with a group tour. Your rental car, yes car will more then be able to make the tip, and you will not be stuck in a van with a bunch of yahoo's The only other must have in Maui is what travel people in the know call the Bible. It is a travel book called Maui Revealed by Andrew Doughty & Harriet Friedman, it is a must have to see all the many things and eat at the greatest local places, and book with the right companies for your many events.

The distribution of towels and washcloths for our room was chintzy, at best. A requested late checkout was flatly denied. A request to repair a slow draining sink and tub was never done. Their attitude was that they were doing us a favor by allowing us to stay at their property, rather than being appreciative of our business. We had a decent mountain view in the distance, but right across the street looked like poverty-city. Our room was below average with furnishings being old and outdated and no food service on the property at all. Both the room and the hotel, in general are past due for major updating. The property did not closely resemble the pictures we found on the Internet.

So be aware of your location if you plan on alot of activites. If you stay at the shores besure you ask for a Ocean Front room and something on the 4th floor or above. I could see where people would not like the ground floor or a mountain view. From our Lanai each morning we had magnificant sunsets and sunrises. Next to the hotel was a night luau but that ended by 8:30-9:00 so it never interfered with sleep as reported in some reviews. The staff was very helpful and went out of they way to help you. It was great having a full kitchen so you could cook if you wanted or heat something up. You were within walking distance of many activities, during the day or night. Our bed was a wall unit that recessed into the wall during the day so we had alot of space. Each unit is decorated differently as these are peoples condo that they rent out during the year.
