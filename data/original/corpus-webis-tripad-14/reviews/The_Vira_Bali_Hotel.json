We have stayed in Bali many times but this is the first time at the Vira (only picked it cause it had a pool access room available on very short notice). This is the best value for money that we have experienced. Not only were the rooms well appointed, clean and although on the small side well set out so they are heaps big enough. The staff are great, easily understood us, and always had a smile. We had a issue with our toilet and within ten minutes of reporting it we had maintenance staff at our door, that is unheard of usually in Bali you generally have to wait and wait and report it at least twice before things are fixed. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a wonderfully relaxing holiday. We will be coming back in June with the family that is for sure.
