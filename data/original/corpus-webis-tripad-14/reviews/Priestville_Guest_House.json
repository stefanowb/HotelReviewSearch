Colin assisted us with all our travel plans and restaurant choices (he is a former chef). Our room was large, comfortable, and quiet. The breakfast was fabulous (try the salmon). The Royal Mile is about a 10 minute bus ride and the bus stop is a short walk from the guest house. The rate for our stay was quite reasonable for the accomodations and large breakfast. We would highly recommend staying at the Priestville Guest House!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Georgespicer", "date": "May 26, 2006", "id": 5224839}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Felt like home", "text": "We could not have been more pleased with the Priestville. The room was huge and clean. The breakfast was excellent. The location was fine--either a 20-minute walk to the Royal Mile or a five-minute bus ride. The best part, however, was our wonderful hosts. Colin and Trina did everything they could to make us feel at home--from a great overview of things to do and see in Edinburgh, to greeting us at the door on our return from touring to see how everything went. I would gladly return anytime and feel that I was staying with friends.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 2, 2006", "id": 4316667}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "The hosts couldn't have been nicer", "text": "We were here for three nights in September. This is a lovely, big B&B about a 25 minute walk from the center of the city or a quick bus ride. The owners, Colin and Trina, could not have been more accomodating and helpful. Colin gave us a map, explained the local bus system, told us where to eat and gave us suggestions on sight seeing. He arranged for a cab for us on the last day and when it wasn't there on time, he was on the phone twice with the cab company making sure it was on its way. Our room was #6 and was on the top floor, with a winding narrow staircase. It had a king sized bed and two twin beds, very large room with TV and VCR. They have videos you can borrow as well as hair dryers. The only thing lacking was good water pressure but we found that was fairly common. It's a 3 minute walk to the bus stop and my mom and I felt safe walking to and from it at night. There was a pay phone in the \"lobby\" as well as a computer that guests may use for a nominal fee. The breakfasts were good and large. Colin even provided us with a taste of haggis so we'd know if we wanted to order it. Very nice place to call home for a few days.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "saqsaq", "date": "October 31, 2005", "id": 4075239}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "My husband and I stayed at the Priestville B&B for 5 nights while we visited Edinburgh. Colin and Trina were great hosts and very helpful with answering our questions. Our room and bathroom were very spacious and the breakfasts were delicious! We loved the Scottish smoked salmon. Colin was very accomodating when we had an early morning tour and served us breakfast earlier than usual. On our last day, we had to leave very early in the morning to catch a flight and Colin kindly packed us smoked salmon sandwiches and orange juice to eat in the airport, since we couldn't stay for breakfast.
