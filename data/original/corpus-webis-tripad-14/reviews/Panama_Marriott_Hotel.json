{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 419, "name": "Panama Marriott Hotel", "reviews": [{"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Due to issues setting up a trip to Panama City, I was forced to stay at this Marriott, when I typically prefer small boutique hotels. I thought that in exchange for the lack of charm, I would at least be able to take advantage of \"big hotel\" features, like lots of options for eating and drinking, and also to be able to enjoy the swimming pool. Not so. One of the problems in finding a decent hotel in Panama City seems to be the fact that most of the city is under construction. In addition to much renovation and building, the city is building a metro, which causes major disruption of traffic, dirt & noise. The Marriott was recommended as a hotel which would be quieter than many others, so I agreed to stay there. The rooms were clean & quiet; even the air handling system was quiet, which I greatly appreciated. Very good sleep quality: nice linens, good bed. Some furnishings were quite new, like the carpet and draperies. Other parts, like the desk, looked pretty old, and had scuffs touched-up. There was some mildew on the grout in the bathroom. All of the staff members that we encountered were very pleasant. Now for the things I didn't like. First of all, I was a tourist, and hoped to enjoy the pool during some of my free time. The pool was closed for safety reasons due to construction on the building next door. That seemed sensible, but I was disappointed. When I asked the concierge about the closure, she said that the hotel offered a free taxi to another hotel nearby to use that pool, but it seemed like too much effort. Secondly, food and drink were unduly difficult. We were not on the \"club\" floor, so our choices were the cafe, the lobby bar and the sports bar \"Champions\". The lobby bar was nice, but frequently closed. We went for a drink Friday evening around 6pm----closed! The lobby bar remained closed for virtually any time you might want a cocktail. Sundays are sometimes problematic for dining, so we planned to just eat in the cafe Sunday evening----closed! For both cocktails & dining, the only option was Champions, which, honestly, is hideous. Decor by 14 year-old boys----peanuts in football helmets, really?----head banger music, multiple tv screens of various sports, mostly junk food on the menu. This place is awful, but it was often the only choice. Marriott, please lose this hangover from the 1980's. Third, WiFi was not free, and there was a hefty charge to use the internet in the Business Center. Finally, as other reviewers have mentioned, the taxi issue is a problem, and the hotel should be more active in intervening. The taxis in Panama City are apparently on a \"zone\" fee basis, rather than on meters. This means that they can basically rape and pillage on price, and you don't have much bargaining power. My travel guide said that the price from the Marriott to Casco Viejo should be $3. The rate that I got was $8, and the bellman was of no use in getting a better price. We were able to walk to some restaurants, and felt pretty safe, although sidewalks are in very bad repair, and if you are not careful, you could break your neck. Overall, Panama City isn't a tourist-friendly place, and the city is not doing much to change this. The Marriott is fine if you have to work the entire time; otherwise consider another place.", "title": "ok for business", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "PoisonPrincess", "date": "February 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 124712236}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "A nice Marriott with above average service but no view and not in best area for tourists.

That said the rooms are larger than what I consider average for Marriott and were it not for the location I would rate this an above average Marriott.
