The room was very expensive but we decided to stay there for its beach location and availability. We were vacationing for a beach holiday. What a mistake. From the moment the keys didn't work and the front desk person left us standing at the door, waiting for her (she never did come back and we ended up having to go to the front desk to see what the heck had happened to her) we should have known the stay would be awful. The front desk people have terrible hotel training, if any, and they barely speak English. There was one American front desk person (female) who was wonderful but it didn't make up for the rest who were lacking in customer service and acted as if you were bothering them to ask them a question. The food was priced outrageously and portions and quality were a joke. My son had a plain cheese pizza at the beach for almost $15 and it was basically a microwaved single serving sized pizza. My $18 salad was lame. I mean, if you are going to pay $18 for a salad, have a salad as nice as the half portion salad at the Coogies Restaurant by the Ralph's which was $11. Cut out the fancy amenities like the TINY individual boxed chocolates for turndown (what a waste of a little cardboard box each night). As an afterthought, they tell you there is complimentary coffee and tea in the morning from 5 til 7 (huh? who gets up that early on vacation?) I mean, have the coffee out all day and it will encourage people to come into the restaurant. Or have it in the room. They advertise such an elegant mini bar but who eats a snack bag of potato chips for $3? The bottles of FIJI water in the room cost over $6 each. Huh? The Valet guys were very nice and friendly (Valet is an extra $20 something charge a night) and so how are you supposed to know whether to tip the guys or not? You feel cheap if you don't but my gosh, how much money can they suck out of you at this hotel? At least the Valet guys left a couple of bottles of water in your car each day. We pleasantly complained to the General Manager by phone and received a box of chocolates. That was nice, but hopefully he will make some changes and not just shut the guests up with chocolates. There are a lot of real people out there (not celebrities with money to throw down the toilet) who don't mind spending money on quality if the bang is worth the buck. It isn't here. THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE -- we received a wake up call at 5 a.m. which we hadn't requested. 5 a.m.! The response when we went to the desk later to say, \"What the heck was up with that wake up call?\" was something lame like the person who had requested it had changed rooms. But we had been in the same room three nights prior. Barely an apology. Wouldn't you think the night before someone would have called the room to double check that we really wanted a 5 a.m. wake up call? Save for the location right on the beach, and the sprinkling of celebrity sightings, there was nothing nice about this \"upscale\" hotel.

When we went into the inn to the reception area to register, we were left standing there waiting while a gentleman complained about problems with his reservation and the price he was paying. Finally someone else came to the front desk to register us. We were taken to our room by a very polite young lady and she showed us the features of the room which was a nice touch. The partial ocean view was marginal because you overlooked a parking in back of portable buildings which I assume were part of the hotel. It was very unattractive. Next, the \"free\" internet did not work. When I called the front desk , the person who answered the phone gave me a toll-free number to call, but was not able to answer any of my simple questions. I can see the need for tech support, but someone answering the phones should have some general knowledge of the internet set-up in the hotel in which they work. The rooms are very nicely furnished and decorated, but on the small side. There is a patio and glass sliding doors, but no screens. The air-conditioner made a very loud buzzing sound and vibrated our ceiling to such a point that we turned it off. When we went downstairs to have a quick snack on the patio overlooking the ocean, no one came to give us menus nor to take our order even though two restaurant employees walked right by our table and looked right at us. All that they would have had to say was \"I'll be right with you\" or something pleasant to that same effect. We just got up and left. Lastly, the Pacific Coast Hwy which runs in front of the hotel is very busy and impossible to cross. The neighborhood is totally run-down with many vacant, decaying buildings and weed-filled parking lots. I could not believe that this was Malibu and that I was paying over $490/night for a room in this seedy area with only a beach and ocean to its credit. I would be very ashamed to live here.

The room was overpriced, we had to pay for everything! I mean everything! It was mandatory valet, and the parking was literally a few feet away. They managed to charge $26 for that. My car was kept out in the sun, so it wasn't even worth it. The front desk (Eugene specifically) was rude. We ate at the restaurant, and I've had a better NY steak at sizzler. We originally booked a table outside to enjoy the ocean, but it was freezing! No heat lamps whatsoever...go figure. There was no pool, no jacuzzi, no bathtub in the room, and no gym. A tiny bottle of water was almost $6! Give me a break! When you pay that much money for a room, you should have all of the bells and whistles that come for that price.
