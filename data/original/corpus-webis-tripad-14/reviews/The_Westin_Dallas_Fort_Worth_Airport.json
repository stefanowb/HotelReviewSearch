Wrong! This hotel is on the back side of DFW airport and there is nothing around but hotels, a gas station, and a Denny's. We went ahead and checked in and decided we'd take a chance on the hotel restaurant, the BlueFire Grill. It looked nice from the lobby and it was not crowded. After waiting to be greeted at the door for 5-7 minutes, I noticed the bartender and a waitress sitting at the adjoining bar. Both looked up on seperate occasions, but neither came over or called for help. We turned and left....as did others. Now we know why it was not crowded! Their loss! But, we were still hungry. Not wanting to face my screaming 6 year olds, we walked across the street to Denny's.
