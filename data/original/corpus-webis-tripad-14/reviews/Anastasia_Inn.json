The next morning the clerk told us we had rearranged the rooms, so we could stay where we were. Hooray! Everything worked fine in this hotel. Bathroom had a little mold - I would imagine mold can be tough in Florida. Beds were comfy. Spacious fridge- though I should have checked - it was set very low and wasn't cold enough. The Bridge of Lions is under construction and not really a pleasant walk like we had hoped. Instead we bought the Old Town Trolley tickets for $17 a piece and got picked up right at the hotel by their \"beach shuttle\". The trolley was great - took us everywhere we wanted to go and saved our feet, so we still felt like wandering the town well after dark. We took a cab back after dark for a few bucks. We left our bikes on the back of our car and had no problems. Breakfast included cereal, muffins and bagels. Standard motel fare. St. Augustine is a very fun and cute town.
