We hunted around on various sites and eventually found a rate of $98/n for 4 people in a large room with 2 queen beds. This was a good start. However, even though there weren't many people there, we ended up with people staying above us who sounded like elephants at midnight when they finally came in( there isn't much to do in the village past 5pm) so they must have been out drinking. They're air conditioner ran the 2 nights we were there, all the while dripping on the outside of our air conditioner. That sound kept us awake even when they didin't. THere is very little to do in the area. Don't go for more than 2 nights. Even with a pool and some tennis, that's about all there is unless you travel to MAnchester. Not recommended to go unless its ski season. THey advertise its a year round resort, so they need to find more actiivites.", "title": "Inn at Stratton- Stay Away!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "rfamily7", "date": "July 24, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3697624}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Nice but expensive.", "text": "Stayed here: 5 july 2005 - 6 july 2005", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 18, 2005", "id": 3680179}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "It is close to the snow & there is a hot tub!", "text": "We arrived quite late and didn't know the surroundings so we ended up in Stratton to find this Inn.

Upon our arrival, we entered our room and there were dead bugs everywhere - on the carpet, on the window seat, on all of the furniture. In addition, when we pulled back the comforter there was hair on the bed, and the door to our room was broken and did not lock properly. So, we went down to the front desk and requested our room be cleaned and the door be examined. We left the hotel for the evening and returned almost 7 hours later and nothing - still dead bugs and still a broken door. We angrily went down to the front desk to question why this had not been taken care of, and after much back-and-forth, they finally agreed to move us to a new, clean room. Unfortunately this room was not much better - it still felt dirty, and the air conditioner was broken.
