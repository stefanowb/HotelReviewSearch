This year was anything but. The front desk staff were incompetent, at best, and I thought dismissed my concerns in part because I was a woman travelling alone. After seeing three rooms either at street level and/or full of cigarette smoke, I finally agreed to stay one night in the third, with the understanding that I would be moved to another room the next day. I was assured that this new room would have a dining table and be non-smoking. Neither was true. Basically, they lied. The hotel was full, so switching to yet another room was not possible (I had had it by then anyhow). The rugs were badly spotted, the duvet was well past its toss-by date, the shower sometimes worked and sometimes didn't, the kitchen was ill-equipped and some of the dishes not clean, and I was aghast to discover they charged for teabags and biscuits provided in the room--these routinely are complimentary in even the cheapest British hotel! The staff in the breakfast room appeared to be equally incompetent, claiming that the coffee/hot water machine was broken and would not work \"for several days,\" but making no attempt to provide an alternative. Another member of the staff later fixed this \"broken\" machine in about 10 seconds. This has gone from a classy, clean, well-appointed and pleasant apartment hotel to a dump.", "title": "Great Location", "user": "DallasCPSmom", "date": "August 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8460058, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Room Size and Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Sub-par Air Conditioning, Inconsistent Water Temperature in Shower"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007", "text": "Pros: Location, kitchen facilities, room sizes, clean-ish, free internet, privacy, quiet.", "title": "Reasonable", "user": "AlvinGB", "date": "June 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 7871970}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Cons: Very hard beds, a little worn, poor aircon, no hotel switchboard", "title": "A+ at the Ascott!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "AFBT", "date": "December 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6313035, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Relaxing atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Hard bed"}}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe", "city": "London"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 11, "very good": 29, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 32}, "aka": "Ascott Mayfair Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.564126394052, "description": "Operated by the world's leading serviced residence company - The Ascott Limited - experience luxury and ultimate service while residing in Mayfair, London's most exclusive district.
