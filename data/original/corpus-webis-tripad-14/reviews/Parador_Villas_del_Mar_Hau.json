The hotel exhibits what is best in the Puerto Rican way of life -- relaxed, genial & proud. The restaurant is a certified \"Meson Gastronomico\" & has earned that certification. Fresh lobster & a bottle of rioja cost about 1/2 of what it would cost in the U.S. & was just as good. I would not hesitate to book a week there in the future.
