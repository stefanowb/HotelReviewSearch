The location of the hotel, especially being across the street from the Tube station is great. There are lots of restaurants and shops in the area as well. The single rooms are very small, but they were nicely decorated and comfortable. The rooms were also nicely eqipped, minibar, ironing board, etc. Staff were friendly. The rate for a London hotel was reasonable. On the downside my room, at least, showed some signs of neglect. The only shelf in the bathroom was a glass shelf that lacked, well, glass. This made it's utility as a shelf nonexistent. Notifying the desk did not produce a shelf during my stay. A cupboard door lacked a knob, and an electric outlet appeared to be damaged. Except for the shelf none of these things was an inconvenience, but they were noticeable in a hotel with somewhat elegant pretensions. We ate at \"Olives,\" one of the hotel's restaurants. The decor was nice and the food was very good. It was also very expensive, perhaps a bit more expensive than either the food or decor merited. Overall it was a comfortable place at a reasonable price (dinner aside) to stay for a couple nights on a nontourist trip. Given the location I'd would recommend the hotel, but suggest modest expectations.", "title": "Good, could be better", "user": "arcoonetoe", "date": "January 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6710800, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, comfortable", "disliked": "\u2014 A bit battered around the edges"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I have just returned from a stay here for the weekend.

As with all London hotels the drinks in the bar are very expensive, this hotel has a pub just opposite which is about half the price of the hotel for a sprit and mixer \u00a38 in the hotel, \u00a33.50 in the pub. The hotel bar is very nice though and if you want a quiet drink with no crowds then paying the extra may be worth it to you.", "title": "Good hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "alyson.johnson-smith_123", "date": "January 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6640499, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 The unfriendleness of some check in and bar staff"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall a great hotel which was only let down by some staff who although not rude could not be excused of being friendly.", "title": "Just \"ok\" hotel", "user": "monosakarida", "date": "January 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 6612400, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Room service staff, the bathroom"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled on business", "text": "It was a good hotel but not great.
