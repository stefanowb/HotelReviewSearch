The swimming pool and hot tub was a nice place to hang out and meet people. There is a nice place to sit and relax on the couches and play pool or just read a book.

She said no which was surprising to me because I had read reviews that said that they did do that for several people staying there. She really didn't seem very friendly but everyone else was very nice. Our tour ended up being pushed back a little so we were able to get down there at 7 and ask for to go breakfasts to be ready by 7:20. We had dinner there once and it was also good.
