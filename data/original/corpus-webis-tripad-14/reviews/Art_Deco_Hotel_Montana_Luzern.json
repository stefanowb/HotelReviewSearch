It has to be the best in all of Switzerland. The smoked salmon paired with cucumbers and feta was marvelous. Combined with the beautiful view of Lake Luzern from the dining room, we couldn't have asked for a better morning. The hotel is in a quiet location on the lake, so you don't get much street noise at night. You just take the funicular down to the road and have a very nice walk along the lakeside promenade. The bed in our room was comfortable, the bathroom clean and modern, the staff friendly . I give this hotel my stamp of approval.
