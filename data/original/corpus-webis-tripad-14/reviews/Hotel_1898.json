They are small by American standards, but not an inch of space is wasted. We stayed in two superior, double rooms. The beds were big and comfortable and you have your choice of pillows. The bathrooms are large and gorgeous - all marble and chrome, with towel warmers and showers with full bathtubs. Everything is state-of-the art, which meant that sometimes we had to call the front desk to figure out how to get things to work. The common areas are open, beautiful and inviting. Staff is professional and friendly and you can always find someone who speaks English. There is a small swimming pool on top of the hotel, with a bar and a deck from which you can view all of Barcelona. The hotel is on a part of Las Ramblas that is packed with tourists, but it is fun to walk down the street and see all of the street artists and visit the vendors.

You will always get people who are never satisfied with anything, you know the type. they are at the reception desks screaming at the staff about the slightest issue, no wonder then they get nothing sorted because lets face it, no place or event in the world is perfect and i suppose the true test of a hotel is how they react when things go slightly wrong because hey this is the reality of every day life. So firstly we got to our room, great room but right outside the elevator, based on previous comments i didnt want to settle in the room and find i could hear the elevators through the night (im a light sleeper) so we went down to reception straight away and explained.(by the way they have removed the lift bell on those floors now anyway) we got a better room issued immediately ! Result ! But you know what, if you speak politely without attitude and explain the issue, 99 times out 100, you get it sorted, and thats the point about the negatives reviews here. Next we ordered some bollinger off the menu at 80 euro's, good price i thought, when we got the bill it had 130 euro's on it, on checking the menu i had been given an old menu, no problem sir the correct price is actually 130 euro which i have to charge you but what i will give you is free drinks for the rest of the night !!!(we drunk easily more than twice the diff)- result No 2. Next morning we ordered 2 types of breakfast, they only brought one, on ringing the kitchen they apologised and the other was with us within 3 mins - result no 3. The reception were very helpful with ordering taxis( you cant be charged double going to the airport because they are all on meters NB previous review) and booking restaurants, in fact they got us into a restaurant that was full because they regularly send customers there. We didnt really do any site seeing, it was relax in the sun, wine and dine break and the hotel is perfect for that. The Ramblas outside the hotel is madness in august, it is so busy, so when you step back into the hotel it is like an Oasis of calm and tranquility, and for the previous comment about the bar been quite - what do you want when you have been in crowds of people all day ! certainly not queueing with hoards of noisy people at the bar. If your looking for the better bars and restaurants then turn left has you come out the hotel onto the Ramblas and walk couple of 100 yards up, this way you get away from all the tourists coming off the boats and getting trapped in the Ramblas restaurants which are poor food/high prices. 2 places were excellent, a traditional tapas bar called Alfonso for lunch and theTralaguz restaurant for a big night meal.", "title": "Excellent Hotel - Tranquility in the madness of Ramblas", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Douzer", "date": "August 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8470243, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 quality bed and furnishings, electronic gadgets, silent aircon", "disliked": "\u2014 no irons in hotel"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Everyone has said it all already!!!", "title": "Great Location...beautiful Hotel!", "user": "jbohun", "date": "August 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8462825}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stay here...the only painful part is the price of the cocktails...but after your 3rd amazing Mojito..you will not care!!!!", "title": "Lovely Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Womble9", "date": "August 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8456506, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 It was so quiet in the middle of a noisy area!", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We book thru their website and found a package that included break for only 10 euros more a night...totally worth it!", "title": "Fantastic", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Scudamore", "date": "August 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8434465}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a find!", "text": "GO NOW...and have fun!!!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "CatEastYorkshire_uk", "date": "August 11, 2007", "id": 8395941}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006", "text": "We were in Barcelona for three nights.
