It was a good base for exploring Milan. Close to the Central Station, Metro and trams. Unhelpful Staff. \"ask at Tourist Information\" was the answer to everything! Rooms OK but noisy airconditioning. Breakfast not worth getting up for. U even have to pay an extra euro for an eggcupful of fresh orange juice! Stayed in room and had a lovely cup of tea made with good old British teabags! We didnt pay very much for our stay so we were quite pleased at this. This hotel didnt spoil our great weekend. Visit the Navigli area. U won't be disappointed.

I tried the delle Tulipe on my return to Milan and was given a room there. The single room was very small (which is fine with me) but quiet and easily accessible by the small elevator. The breakfast was as mingy as the other reviews have mentioned, but acceptable.
