The first night we arrived they simply told us to call back in the morning as there was nothing they could do. After the engineer left the airconditioning still left a lot to be desired. When asked if we enjoyed our stay upon check out my husband told the desk manager that the airconditioning was not working properly in the room despite a visit from maintenance. The manager told my husband that \"Americans find the European systems weak compared to their own but that this was normal for Europe.\" I held my tongue and did not tell him that our friends in 754 had a perfectly good system, we lived in London and are used to staying in European hotels and no this was NOT normal.\"", "title": "Perfect location, lovely rooms and facilities", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "brfk86", "date": "June 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 114694306}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Provence", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 125, "average": 194, "very good": 322, "terrible": 80, "excellent": 208}, "aka": "Le Meridien Nice Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.455399061033, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "At n\u00b01 Promenade des Anglais, Le M\u00e9ridien Nice is set in the perfect location, facing the sea, right in the centre of town.
