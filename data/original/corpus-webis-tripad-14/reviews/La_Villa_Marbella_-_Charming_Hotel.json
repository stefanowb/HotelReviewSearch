I loved walking by the warm sunny coastline everyday which was just a stone throw away from the hotel. The Old Town certainly did not lack in food department. As a seafood and tapas lover, I sampled some of the best seafood restaurants as directed by the hotel crew, and from experience, the small little busy all-spanish restaurants were the best places to go for authentic foods! The exceptional service by the hotel crew gave my partner and I such a memorable time during our holiday. Attention was paid to every single detail to its very best; the rooms were immaculate, breakfast served every morning was served with such hospitality, the hotel crew made sure all our needs were met, and everyday they tirelessly gave us detailed directions to places of interests, and restaurants we had to try.
