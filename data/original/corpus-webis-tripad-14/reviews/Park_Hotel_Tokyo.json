We received an adorable room with an outrageous view of the Tokyo Tower. We slept with the windows open both nights to admire the view. The hotel described the walk to the hotel as 7 min. but it was a good 15 for us with large luggage in tow. Using the hotel's provided maps and directions the property was very easy to find from the JR Yamanote Shimbashi station. Check-in was a breeze. The room size was slightly small but perfectly sized for our needs. The room was very modern and the bathroom decked out with a fancy toilet with all the bells and whistles. A TON of nice toiletry/spa amenities available. For a 2 day stay in Tokyo the hotel couldn't be better located. We were within short walking distance to the Tsukiji Fish Market and Hama Rikyu Garden. Additionally the JR Yamanote line gave us great access to the Shibuya/Harajuku/Shinjuku areas. The hotel staff didn't have a great range of English, but they did go above the call of duty in one case. I bought an int'l/domestic calling card from the lobby and tried to make a call to a local cell using the card but upon help from the concierge I learned the card I bought couldn't call local cells in Japan. He was kind enough to let me use his cell phone to call my friend - a huge help. Just a note that most US cell phones don't work in Japan as apparently they are on a different network. We had a 9am flight to Beijing on our final morning and the concierge wasn't really able to help us arrange travel to the airport other than recommending the T-CAT since the airport limo bus did not run early enough for us to get to the airport by 7am - again, lost in translation.
