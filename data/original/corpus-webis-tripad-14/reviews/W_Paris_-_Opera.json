We arrived around 5pm and our room wasn't ready. Cecil, the W Insider, was so kind and friendly. She apologized and gave us a tour of the hotel and gave us each a glass of Champagne. After an hour of relaxing at the bar, we asked if we could use the gym - no problem. Cecil even brough our room keys to the gym! Our bags that we left at check in magically appeared in our room. We loved the Magnificent Suite (Room 414) - King bed, sofa, huge closet, soaking tub, rain shower (watch out - it's slippery!), dual sink, and many windows with views of the Opera house. We felt pampered the entire visit. Turn down service in the evening included a treat, window blinds closed, etc. Breakfast in bed was nice and the bartenders were super nice (Thank you Chloe!). Highly recommend the espresso's at the W too. They come with vanilla simple syrup - yum! Transportation to CDG was also very easy using the Roissy Bus - note: the bus drivers take bills and US credit cards - just not the automated machines at the bus stop).

They gave me an upgraded room and free internet which was very welcome. I had an entire afternoon of meetings in the bar and wished there were more places on the ground floor (living room) where the music wasn't so loud. But thats the same at all these properties. I did notice that the wall in the entry foyer in my room was pretty banged up with nicks and marks. The matte black paint shows a lot of wear and tear to an otherwise clean and tidy room.
