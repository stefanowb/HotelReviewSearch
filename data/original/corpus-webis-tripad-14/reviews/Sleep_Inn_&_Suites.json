I hadn't stayed here in the interim, but returning now, I'm amazed and shocked at how much it's gone down hill. The low quality of the furnishings and finishings are beginning to show: our room needs to be freshened. Cleanliness is OK but nothing stellar. And there's lots of little things: doors that don't open easily, an elevator that takes forever, etc. Four years ago, this Sleep Inn was a shining example of what a budget hotel could be; now, it's a sad example of what lack of attention will do in a short time.", "title": "Slip Sliding Away", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Twoprofs", "date": "June 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 131795256}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "For a Sleep Inn, this one is very good.

It is VERY clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable...HOWEVER everything was overshadowed by the poor construction. I have two small children and when making my reservation requested a crib be in our room...after checking in and as I'm carrying my bags, my children's, bags, pushing a stroller, and containing a 3 yr old through the lobby, the clerk plops the portable crib on the front desk and says \"Here's the crib you requested.\" Needless to say that didn't impress me. I had to go back down for a sheet for the crib. We enjoyed the nice pool that evening and returned to our room around 9pm...as we settled in for the night my enjoyed the squeaking mattress and squeals of delight coming from next door...a young child was jumping on the bed...that last around an hour before we fell asleep. At 1am the child was SCREAMING for a blanket...I finally pounded on the wall and the parents got up and quieted the child. At 2 am a smoke alarm was pulled...the front desk attendant wasn't sure what to tell people and the next morning another guest told us it was pulled by two young girls not even staying at the hotel...apparently the doors don't have card swipers to access the hotel after hours...I see this as a huge security risk and probably wouldn't of stayed there knowing that. After everything quieted from the alarm our neighbors on the other side of us returned...they proceeded to smoke and hosts guests...first of all the hotel is non-smoking, the room adjoined ours and the door had a gap around an inch wide, directly where my 10 mth old sleep. The walls were so thin we could hear them word for word. I finally called the front desk around 3:30 (thinking they'd go to bed eventually). The clerk knocked on the door and informed them they'd be charged for the smoking...they denied it and the clerk left asking them to quiet down. At that point the guy got angry and went downstairs telling his friends he'd be back...when he got back he proceeded to throw something against our wall...they talked (although quieter) until 4:30-5am. We had to get up at 7am to get back on the road. The next day checking out I complained to the front desk and the only thing I got from the front desk was an \"I KNOW...I'm trying to get them to invest in sound proofing.\" and some sympathy. It further annoyed me that it seemed to be a common complaint from guests and the management/owner was still not doing anything yet charging people the same room rate.
