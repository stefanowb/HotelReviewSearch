The shuttle driver was very nice and we had a great chat on the way to the hotel. It took us about 20 minutes which seemed like a long time since it was so close by mapquest. The driver even volunteered to take us to the grocery store or CVS pharmacy down the road before we go to the hotel if we needed anything. Even though we were his last pick up before he could head home. When we got to the hotel the desk just handed up the keys, signed one form and up to the room--all this while he was trying to deal with an unfriendly women who wanted a room for dirt cheap.
