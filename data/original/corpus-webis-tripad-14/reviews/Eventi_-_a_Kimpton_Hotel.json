It was a very nice experience. We had a basic king-size room on the 11th floor (#1114). The room was well decorated, small but cosy and perfect for a couple. The bathroom was very nice, well lighted. Everything was super clean. We asked for a quiet room and were very pleased with the room they gave us; we almost didn't hear from the outside, and didn't hear our neighbours as well. As Kimpton Intouch members, we got a $15 gift card to use on items from the mini-bar at our arrival, which was a nice touch. The only complaint I would have, which prevents me for giving this hotel a 5-rating is service. Three times we asked for something, and were disappointed. 1) We asked for an extra comforter at the reception at 6:00pm the first night and when we were back in the room at 10:00pm it wasn't there; they forgot our request. 2) The second day we left the room at 11:00am and were back at 3:00pm to find the room undone. We had to ask the cleaning lady to come and do the room. 3) When we asked for our car at the reception (valet parking) it took them almost an hour to bring it to us. Knowing that the parking was not even a block away and that we were the only ones waiting for their car, we found that delay a little excessive. Talking about parking, the one the hotel use is a public parking under the building. They charge you $50 a day for valet, it's $22 a day when you go park your car yourself. It may be worth doing if you don't mind parking your car yourself... We did not take advantage of the wine offered between 5:00pm and 7:00pm but did enjoy coffee in the morning.

We stayed there because we were in town to see a game at Madison Square Garden and though it would be easy to walk back to the hotel after the game. Wrong decision. There was no where to even have a drink after the game. The hotel operates its only bar/restaurant as a night club for kids who wait in line to get in late at night. Even if you wanted to be there, its very loud and there are no seats available. The hotel that has no interest in catering to its guests, but instead prefers the revenue from operating its night club. As far as the hotel itself goes, its fine.
