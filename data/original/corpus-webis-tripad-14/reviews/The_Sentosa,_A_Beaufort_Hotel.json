Only downside was that although they said this was served until 10:30pm at 10:00pm the staff were trying to hurry us to take dessert as they were about to close. They wanted to/and did once we'd taken desserts, start to clear the buffet to prepare for breakfast. We did feel a bit rushed and \"in the way\" which was a pity.

There was an Indian restaurant which we asked about on the 2nd day and were told last orders were at 8.30pm - we went at 8pm and they said it was closed. When we complained they did let us stay in the bar area and they did serve us dinner, but again it was rather rushed (main courses arrived about a minute after the starters!) and we felt a nuisance.

Location of the hotel is very good, friendly staff willing to help and support, pick up and return to the airport was good. They have a shuttle service every half hour to Vivocity (very large mall with shops and restaurants) as well as to the Paragon (Singapore Orchard Road). Rooms are perfect with a good bed and a great shower. However we had the feel that they cut back on people. Staff was friendly and helpful, but not enough staff to keep things going (or not well organised?). At the pool they good have made more money if they would just come by every now and then to ask for another order, at the terrace restaurant tables were not cleaned on time or made up in full, coffee milk, sugar missing, no napkins and so on. Again the staff was doing their utmost best to keep up, but needed more hands on board.... Something you would not expect from a five star........ Keep in mind as well that the hotel is not that close to the beach. You need to go down the stairs at the pool and walk for another 5 minutes to reach the beach. Turn right down the stairs if you are looking for a beach chair. These are not complimentary. Need to rent them, so better stay at the hotel pool.

Yes, the hotel is showing its age but very gracefully. Everything you need is here including choice of 3 restaurants of different styles, prices are Singapore standard - expect to pay 18SGD for each of the many cocktails you should indulge in... Hotel runs shuttle buses everywhere you need to go and Sentosa has multiple beach transport options if you dont feel like walking. Took advantage of the good quality tennis courts and free bike hire.
