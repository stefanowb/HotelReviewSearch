The hotel is beautiful and the hotel bar had great pork sliders (had them for dinner twice in three days). I usually don't eat at hotel restaurants, but made an exception on this trip because we had good food at the Sheraton we stayed in before we came to San Francisco. I'm glad we tried the hotel bar-as I was too tired at night to go exploring to see what other food options were near by. There was a Bucca De Peppi (sp?) across the street, but I'm not big on food chains--I'd rather eat local. The room condition was good--but at night we could definitely hear the calls for the taxi to pick up other guests--especially the last night when there was a whistle. While the location was good, a block closer to Union Square would have been perfect. I liked Union Square a lot as a base and the hotel was close to the Cable Cars and bus (recommend the 3-day bus pass). The concierge were great! They recommended good places in China Town, Italian area, and I'm glad we were able to walk everywhere and take the bus/cable cars. The hotel was very clean but had some quirks--with the double bed, the person nearest to the shower can't sleep when someone else is in the shower because of the light reflection--but the rooms were overall very nice. I'd recommend to others traveling in the area--as long as they walked towards Union Square and not away. All in all, I'm happy I booked this hotel especially for the hotwire rate I got and I'm so glad we didn't stay in Fisherman's Warf. My only real San Francisco complaint was that it was so fogged in we didn't get to see the Golden Gate Bridge--which would have been cool to see.
