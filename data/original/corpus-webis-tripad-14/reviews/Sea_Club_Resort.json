Then, we receive our own room key and went up to our assigned room; it had two beds instead of one king (as specified in our reservation), and the room smelled REALLY bad of mildew. I'm pretty tolerant with stuff like that, but the odor was overpowering. BUT - here's the good part of the review! We endured that first night (was too tired from travel to address it with the front desk). The next morning, I explained the situation to the counter person (I forget her name), she was SUPER accommodating. She let me check another room to make sure it was to my liking and satisfaction - it was. We had a problem with the lock, and she sent someone right up to fix it. The new room had a nicer view, too (and very comfortable bed). The hotel IS in need of some TLC and general renovation, but overall, it's pretty decent. We didn't use the little restaurant and bar connected to it, but clearly that place (The Deck) is very popular, as it was hopping and busy the whole time. I didn't use the pool, but it looked very nice and inviting. I had a drink and enjoyed the atmosphere out there one evening as the sun set. Also, the Sea Club is very near all of the great Ft. Lauderdale stuff you'd want to experience: beach, Galleria, Wilton Manors and Coral Ridge areas, etc. Lots of dining and nighlife around there as well. We walked to Bubba Gumps Shrimp for dinner the first night. If you're looking for real high class, luxury accommodations... then don't stay here.

In particular, Sandra at the front desk and Ronen, the manager, always greet us like old friends and go out of their way to make sure that we are happy with our room and have everything that we want. The rooms are always comfortable and clean and over the years, they have done quite a lot of remodeling to update the hotel. They have complimentary beach towels and lounge chairs available at the front desk that you can take to the beach. There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel which is a nice bonus considering the affordable rates. There are many restaurants, bars and coffee shops within walking distance of the hotel although it has its own bar/restaurant, The Deck, which offers good food and drinks and a great view of the ocean.
