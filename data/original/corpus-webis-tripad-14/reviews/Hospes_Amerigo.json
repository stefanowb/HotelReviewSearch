Entry is gained through a locked door at street level which leads to a pretty, tiled foyer with stairs and an elevator. My only complaint here is that the street-level door is difficult to open from the inside. The door knob is small, hard to get a grip on, and the door itself is heavy. Anyone with arthritic hands be warned. My apartment was spacious, modern-looking, with a separate bedroom and living room, wood floors, and immaculately clean. The kitchenette area had a full-size refrigerator, stove and clothes washing machine. The bathroom had modern facilities, including a bidet, and a large shower with good water pressure. Additional perks were internet access, flat-screen TV, cable TV with some English-language channels, good lighting and a comfortable bed. The apartment had ceiling-high double doors leading to a small balcony and the bedroom had two large windows. Opening both, I could get a good cross-breeze. There was no view to speak of. The balcony overlooked a narrow alleyway and the bedroom windows faced someone else\u2019s back porch where laundry was hung out to dry. Other than the problem with the street-level door, there were only two downsides: First, loud voices ALL night coming from revelers in the street. One night I heard a bottle breaking. Probably you\u2019d get that anywhere downtown. In Spain, many people sleep in the afternoons and are up all night. Closing the bedroom door and ear plugs, which I brought, solved that problem. Second, don\u2019t drive in Alicante! It\u2019s a nightmare with one-way narrow streets that are unmarked and with no place to pull over. There\u2019s no parking anywhere. The hotel has a very small, extremely tight underground parking garage at a steep price (I believe it was 25 euros per day), plus you have to reserve it in advance. If you opt for this, be sure your car is very very small! I parked my rental car in the garage the first night then returned it the next day. I decided it would be a lot less stressful (and cheaper) to rely on public transportation. Overall, I found the apartment extremely comfortable.", "user": "annnocella", "date": "April 22, 2011", "id": 105072697}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice hotel but dangerous bathrooms!", "text": "Stayed in this hotel on Saturday 9th April with a mate on a night out in Alicante! Reception area fantastic and efficient friendly check in. Very hard to find and intially I had emailed for directions to parking and am still awaiting the courtesy of a response. First room room was too dark with no natural light and we quickly asked to be moved which reception happily did. Our second room faced the road, was airy/bright and had a small balcony. We wanted to use the pool but was closed for a week with no advance notice. Bathrooms were very large but poorly designed. Our shower was over the bath and difficult to enter and leave due the full glass shower door......entry and exit very slippy. I slipped and fell hurting my back, foot and elbow.

A city centre location does mean however that you can expect a LOT of noise and this was certainly the case here. We were woken each morning by a street cleaner which starts at 6:45am. On Thursday night there was a lot of noise from rowdy groups standing in the square opposite shouting and singing. To make it worse, at the time of our stay there were public drilling works going on right outside the apartment. The noise was deafening and one day we couldn't get out of the main entrance because there was a large hole between the door and the pavement which we would have had to jump across. When we have previously stayed at hotels, we have been informed in advance of building works due to take place and offered a discount. Here, we were told that if we wanted to move to a less noisy room in the hotel, we would be charged extra!", "user": "GASUk", "date": "May 13, 2011", "id": 108068374}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Noisey and poor sewage system", "text": "The reception staff give the impression of simply not caring about the comfort of their guests and you feel as though you ought to be thanking them for allowing you to stay at 'the only five star hotel in Alicante'. We clearly requested one of their advertised twin rooms but got a double bed. We were told you could split the bed into two, but there was only one sheet and duvet. I had to ask 4 times before somebody finally came to assist. The complimentary toilettries consisted of shower gel and shampoo - not even a bar of soap! The advertised bathrobes, slippers, hair dryer were all absent from the room - on requesting them we were told 'guests like to bring their own!' You get a hairdryer and soap in a Travelodge so why they don't bother here smacks of laziness. There were only 4 coat hangers in the whole apartment, we requested more but they never turned up. The satellite TV didn't work, I reported it but nobody came to fix it.
