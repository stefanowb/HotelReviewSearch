Check in was smooth; front desk team super friendly, helpful, and professional. This hotel has valet parking for which they hit you up for 18 bucks a day. They helped us unload the car which was huge because we were traveling with our 4 month old, so we pretty much brought all the baby gear we own. Our room was on the second floor away from the elevator and near a side exit. There really aren't any great views from this property...the \"waterfront\" claim is pretty misleading as you have to walk down Deer Street to catch a glimpse of the Pisqataqua River. We did have a decent view of downtown. The room layout is typical Marriott. Kitchen space, desk, sitting area in one room, bedroom and bathroom in the next room. It worked out great for us, as we could put baby to bed in one room and watch TV and relax in the living room. The downside was that there were a couple strands of hair on the shower tile. It was gross. I wiped them away and moved on. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great and was quiet. Kitchen had full refrigerator, toaster, stove top, dishwasher. Linens and soap are provided. One day we went down to the pool thinking we might go in. It was filthy! Large clumps of hair were floating in it and the water was cloudy. Disappointing. We alerted the front desk and they sent \"Channing\" to take care of it. Breakfast was good. Lots of space so you don't feel like you're on top of people as some other brands we've experienced. Staff was always asking guests how everything is, replenishing items, cleaning, wiping surfaces. Food was decent. Breakfast was included. The property is just a short walk to Congress and Commercial Streets. We only got our car once on a rainy day to go to LL Bean in Freeport. We took advantage of the walkability and that is really what makes this property a good choice.

We loved the daily included breakfast that had hot and cold options which were tasty and not \"fake\" food. Our check in was smooth as was our check out. Room was clean, fresh and modern. I didnt hear anyone else walking around or making noise. The only downfall was that we were on the back side of the hotel away from the construction (which was good) but we heard all the in and out of the staff emptying trash or the dumpsters being emptied in the very early morning hours.
