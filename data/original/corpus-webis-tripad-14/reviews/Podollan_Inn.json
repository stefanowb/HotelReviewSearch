I called the Podollan Inn and they were full except for the honeymoon suite. The cost for the suite for one night was more than I wanted to spend for one evening and I was not honeymooning! The clerk I spoke with spoke to her manager and gave me a significant discount in order to help me as the other hotels were booked up as well. The service was great, the room was lovely with a fabulous view of the hills and the pool area. I think my favorite part was the bed and the linens! I need to find out what type of beds they are because I had the best sleep of my life! The linens were top quality and the room was spacious and very clean. Definitely stay at the Podollan Inn, it doesn`t feel like your typical hotel but much more personal with the added bonus of a great night sleep! :)", "title": "Amazing bed!

Judging by the beautiful pictures on the website and the expensive price we paid, we were looking very forward to our stay. When we pulled upto the \"motel\"...we looked at eachother wondering if we were at the wrong location. We arrived late afternoon and were told our room wasn't ready - they have a \"guaranteed\" room time of 3pm, and so if a guarantee isn't met, then what? We were told 2 girls \"didn't show up\" and therefore they're behind. What they didn't tell us was it would be over an hour wait for our room to be ready - and what they didn't know was we had a wedding to attend to at 5pm. We asked how we would be compensated for the inconvenience and they said they would \"invite us to sit on the couches in the foyer.\" We laughed. Are they for real? As we were waiting, an employee walks in to start her shift and the girl at the front desk asked her how she was doing and her reply was \"hungover...but i'll survive.\" Oh, that's classy. Exactly what we wanted to hear. Over an hour went by and our room was finally ready - when we got there we saw the manager and her highschool daughter putting the finishing touches on our room. We walked in and it was NOTHING like the pictures. That was the icing on the cake. They knew 4 people would be staying in the room and they only give 2 towels and 1 bar of soap. Smart. Upon checkout, they said they did all they could do to accomodate us as best as possible. We refused to take that as an answer and they decided to give us $10 off our room rate, which was nothing for the time wasted and TOTAL inconveniece of the whole stay. Friends of ours stayed at the Best Western and Super 8 and were treated like royalty for half the cost.
