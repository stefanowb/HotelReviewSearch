The hotel wasn't like \"OMG this is beautiful\" but more like \" Eh, this is nice... and interesting... but I've had better.\" I had asked for a double Portola room with a view of the beach and a balcony. We were accomidated the room, a balcony, but if we wanted to see anything, besides the back of a night club's brick wall we'd have to stand on the two chairs on the balcony and look over faaaarrr to the right. Anyhow, that was a total bummer. :( The room was comfortable, it's like every other hotel room. The toilet didnt flush well, and we were very limited on hot water from the sink and shower heads. :( So while trying to shower, you'd get luke warm water, and then a gush of cold and then a gush of blazing hot would pour out on top. so strange. On our second night there, my sisters and I were returning to our room from shopping. It was approximately 6 pm and there were ZERO parking spaces in their garage! So I called the front desk and the guy whom had answered stated that we can park down the street, about 3-4 blocks away from the hotel, and we'd just have to walk to the hotel (in the pouring rain). Also, there was going to be a $7.00 charge each time we'd leave the garage, even if it were only going to be for dinner or something. So what ever, we just sat around the garage, and finally, after 30-45 minutes of doing so, a couple left so we took their vacant spot. The girls and I spent an hour or so, soaking in their hot tub and swimming in their pool, in the rain. That was very nice only except, my lips were completely salty. EEWW gross! Upon check out, we found that our TV remote didn 't work, why? I don't know. So I called downstairs and checked out. With the prices here, I think I'd rather fork out a little less to stay at the Best Western... I mean, you'd pay less, get the beach view... heck, you'd be on the beach!!!
