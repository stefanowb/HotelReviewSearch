We arrived at 10pm to a very helpful guy at reception who explained everything to us and how our all inclusive worked. As we had missed all inclusive meals for the day, he advised that there was sandwiches that we could have. Rooms where very clean (room 509 on 5th Floor). Maid service was very good and towels where changed everyday. The pool is very small and only gets the sun until 1pm which i found quite annoying as i like to laze around the pool all day, but the sun terrace on the 6th floor gets the sun all day long and there is a cold water jacuzzi that you can cool down in, there is also a bar on the sun terrace. I really cant understand why alot of people where saying that the food was terrible, it was far from it. For breakfast you could have toast, cereal, fruit, yoghurt , bacon, sausages egg and beans. Lunch and dinner consisted of soup, pasta's, salads, 3types of meat/fish, vegetables, potatoes and a choice of cakes. Everyday the meats/fish was different there was never anything repeated for the 7days that we were there apart from the lasagne which we had twice and i was pleased to see it the second time becuase it was just beautiful. Tip: if you are all inclusive and heading out for the day, you can get a free packed lunch from the hotel to take with you. The hall lighting was very dull especially when you just come in from the sun. We met a guy on our first night who advised us about the cockreal which he heard every morning at around 4am which then set the dogs off from the pet shop that was next door to the hotel and that this went on all day long, But this did not happen, we heard the cockreal the odd time which did set off the dogs at times but it definatley didnt go on all day. There was a fly problem, im not sure if it was just the hotel or if it was all of malta, but we had insect repellant which we sprayed on and around our sun beds and it did help keep them away. The entertainment in the evenings was geared towards the older crowd but still we enjoyed ourselves. The staff where very friendly and very helpful. We also found the people staying at the hotel were friendly also.

Yes, if you compare the hotel to 5* hotels (at 5* prices) you might be able to whinge a bit, but for what we paid, it was great value for money. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the place was spotlessly clean. My 23 year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we are keen to put this positive review forward for the hotel, because it is well deserved.
