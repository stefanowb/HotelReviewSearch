We didn't take the breakfast, as it is really overpriced (22 euros per person). Hotel is in the business&medical area and the U-bahn is 10-15 minutes away, 7 stops from the city centre.

The staff was super nice and curteous, always ready to help or assist in any way possible. The rooms are cleaned very well, and the bed was the most comfortable I had ever experienced at a hotel. The clear glass wall that let's you see in to the bathroom took a bit of getting used to, but after a couple of days, my wife and I just laughed at it and thought...oh well...after all, we are in Europe. The spa was nice. It's co-ed and nudity is allowed so don't be surprised if you see some. Again...after a day or two you just get used to it. If you go during Summer months expect lots and lots of young children from Dubai to be running, rollerblading, and playing soccer on every sqaure inch of ground both in and around the hotel.
