I keep coming back because I have a positive experience every time. I give it a four, but it's a four based on the type of accommodation it is - an airport motel, and for an airport motel it's very good. The pick up/drop off service to and from the airport is excellent, the rooms are of a decent size and the bathroom is bigger than my one at home, so no complaints there either. The staff are all helpful and friendly, and as long as I keep receiving the same level of service I'll continue to use BKs Pioneer when I need Auckland airport accommodation.", "title": "Good, consistent service every time", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ChilliCat16", "date": "August 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117018765}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I am fusyy when it comes to hotel, motels, and now prefer a classic motel, more room and more comfortable!
