Alas, it did not come up to my expectations from the wellness point-of-view (wellness area too small, few facilities on offer). The room in the new part of the building, while quite large and fairly cozy, has many disappointing features. Whatever did the interior designer think? When you want a shower and have the lights on, you have to draw the curtains if you do not want the opposite neighbour to see you. The bathtub is the most dangerous that I have ever come across - you slide right down in the water and there is no handrail. The shaving mirror is a joke and you cannot read in the chair as it has no armrests. In summary, the room is full of cute little gadgets but it is not at all functional. A lot of love has gone into it but the result is annoying.", "title": "Very kind staff", "user": "blacklab", "date": "November 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 49172585}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled on business", "text": "On the positive side, the staff are charming and efficient, the manageress ever-present and most helpful, the food is good and the breakfast is just about the best I have ever come across.
