The walk to a beach is about a mile: on a path along the shoreline over the rocks, through the streams and coastline forest to the town, then a skiff awaited us to help us cross the river to the beach (for 10 pesos and operational until 2pm, thereafter, a bridge will get you across, add another 1/2 mile to your journey). The rain did not start until after 2pm, and when it rained daily, it pounded warm rain, flooding the streams and the river, walking back was tedious and dangerous. Another option was hiring a motorized skiff from the beach (for a small fee) to carry you back through the rain to a rocky shoreline area near the house.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Pamela4400", "date": "September 27, 2009", "id": 44936735}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This house is not for the weak of limb or heart. A recent change in management led to some confusion in the booking process. Yelapa had no cars, no computers service available, we had cell or land line service and and no neighbors nearby. Of course sounds like a getaway from reality , and it is - but being truly incommunicado I had issues with safety isolated at the house, should I need it (reality) . Although we had no incident, we heard from locals of incidents with tourists walking the coastline back to their houses. As the house has an open format, exposed to the mountain in back, and really a balcony over the water in front, critters creeped, crawled and flew into our #2 unit. Advisement of scorpion vigilance made it difficult to fully relax (although we never saw one!). When the rains blew in, some furniture was soaked - including our beds until we moved them. Nothing ever dried while I was there due to the high and constant humidity, I went home with a suitcase of wet things. And my personal pet peeve, the safe is not safe (as it is lightweight and not bolted down.", "title": "Depressed to leave this paradise!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "kublueyes", "date": "September 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 42680780}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "That being said, the house is beautiful.

The small waterfall is worth the hike - just lovely. The pie ladies sell their homemade goods on the beach and the pies are delicious. The eternity pool at La Lagunita is soothing and fresh watered. A visit to UNESCO's Isla Marietas was fabulous for snorkeling and views.

Make an excellent choice and go here! Its a bit of a walk to get to the main beach and you must cross a small river to do so. Bring flash lights, be friendly and attempt to speak Spanish!

All three romantic Indonesian-inspired loft suites of Casa Pericos sleep up to 14 when rented together, but may be easily closed off to be two or three very spacious lofts, all with private baths and separate kitchens to accommodate our guest's needs.With breathtaking ocean and jungle views, calm warm ocean breezes, and waters teaming sea life literally at your front door, you will immediately understand why people are instantly lured to jump into the water before they even unpack. Once settled in, take a soak in our Zen Soaking tub with expansive jungle and ocean views, or shower in our private outdoor shower pavilion, before enjoying a margarita on your balcony overlooking Banderas Bay. We are located in the quietest area of Yelapa on The Point, yet Casa Pericos is only a five minute walk to the village restaurants and two locals dance clubs, or 20 minutes walking to the main beach or nearest waterfall.
