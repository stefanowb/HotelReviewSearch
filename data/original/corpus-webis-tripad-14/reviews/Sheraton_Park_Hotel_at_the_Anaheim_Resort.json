The pool area is very nice. If you are traveling with your dog, they will provide you with a special dog bed and food dish - make sure you request it with your reservation. There is no initial charge - but they do a room inspection after you leave and will charge you for any damage. The $14/day for parking seems a bit steep, but it is a resort area and parking is at a premium. Remember where you are and just be prepared. One great aspect - request a room facing the parks - free fireworks show at night and it is fun to sit on the patio and watch! Also, the club lounge service was great.

The cleanliness of the pool area was also great. The rooms were also clean and excellent. The beds, like most have said, are very comfortable and we ordered room service and were pleasantly surprised with the quality AND quantity of the food. We slept perfectly at night with no outside noise and the staff was great. Basically, I recommend this hotel to anyone. If you're staying to visit disneyland, it's close enough to walk to or they have a transit system stop right outside the hotel.

The hotel appears older however it was clean and the service was good. I have 2 main issues with this hotel of which only 1 would keep me from coming back. It allows smoking and you have to walk past the smokers to get to the room towers. There are ashtrays everywhere at the pool and the smokers that go with them! We had to move several times to get away from the constant smoke! The other issues and this is just an FYI \u2013 there is a small store/coffee shop and a gift shop at the hotel and they do not accept room charges so I had to trek back to my room past the smokers to get some money so make sure you bring your CC or cash. There is also a caf\u00e9 that serves breakfast and lunch and it was very good. I had oatmeal with fresh berries for breakfast and it was delicious and for lunch I had the clubhouse and it was excellent with fresh avocado and was so large I could only eat half. Our room was on the 11th floor with 2 queens and a Juliet style \u201cbalcony\u201d that overlooked the pool. The rooms on either side of us had full balconies. This was not an issue for us but it might be for others. The room was compact and the bathroom was small. The vanity was outside the bathroom and in the bathroom were the toilet and a shallow tub/shower combination with a shower curtain. The room had a complimentary safe and small refrigerator which we used. They charge $9.95 per 24 hours for WiFi internet which is annoying however you can print up your boarding passes for free in the small business office near the lobby. My sister had a king room overlooking Disneyland and her room was very large although the bathroom set up was the same however her closet was nearly twice the size of mine. We watched the fireworks from her full balcony and it was great. We took cabs to and from the park which was much easier than dealing with the shuttle. My son loved Disneyland and I loved watching him love it however for me this place is over priced and over commercialized and I hope I never have to go back. With the exception of California Adventure, Disneyland hasn\u2019t change much (inside the park) from my last visit nearly 20 years ago and having to exit through gift shops at the end of popular rides is criminal!
