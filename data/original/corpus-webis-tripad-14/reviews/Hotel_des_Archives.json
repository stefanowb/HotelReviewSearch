Hotel De Ville, Notre Dame, Picasso Museum, Pompideau center are also within walking distance (15-20 minutes) of the hotel. The room I had was a single, well appointed furnishings and a decent sized en suite bathroom. The hotel staff was incredibley friendly in offering restaurant suggestions, providing directions to museums, and helping make a few local phone calls. The hotel also has free wi-fi access.
