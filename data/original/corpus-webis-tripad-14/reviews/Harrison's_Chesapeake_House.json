I knew that the hotel had a smartphone app for \"concierge service\" and I was excited to try it out for my stay. So, while en route in a taxi from Penn Station, I confirmed my arrival time for check in. The app would also allow you to order room service and other amenities.

My room was on the 9th floor and was fantastic. A somewhat smallish 1BR suite, but with great looking furniture, control panel buttons for lights, lamps, etc., a large desk area, two flat screen tvs, a bar area with sink, a large walk-in shower stall, large comfortable bed, lots of closet space. Really a nice room that you could spend a week in without getting uncomfortable. My one complaint is that the despite the various lighting options throughout, the room was never really brightened. Very low wattage bulbs in use, I think.", "user": "Sharon L", "date": "July 9, 2013", "id": 166938068}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "worst crabcake I have ever had", "text": "I had a drink on their rooftop bar. Very nice and a good staff. Had it not been cool and breezy that evening, I would have stayed longer. I ate dinner in the restaurant bar. A very good wine selection, but I had a disappointingly over-cooked pizza; I could only eat half of it and as I had a large salad, was not left too hungry.
