Absolutely what you would expect from the Marriott brand. The service however was not the best. We called ahead to inform them of our late arrival as we had a reservation. Yet when we did arrive, the night desk clerk was not exactly friendly or welcoming... not even a smile! The next morning we requested a late check out, but the front desk apparently neglected to tell housekeeping. Oops! The worst part was finding a used washcloth on a tub \"shelf\" from a previous guest. GROSS! Obviously an oversight from housekeeping. Would loved to have enjoyed the pool facilities but when it's 90\u00ba outside who wants a hot, sticky indoor pool? With the climate here, they need an outdoor pool. We love to stay at Marriot properties, and will again. Maybe it was just an off day for these folks? ??", "title": "Beautiful property, but service not the Marriott quality we expect", "user": "bessiedear", "date": "July 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 169482101}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "During my stay at Residence Inn San Bernardino, I was treated respectfully and professionally.
