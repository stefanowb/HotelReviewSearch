The room rate is very good value, especially if you get a deal with free wifi in your room and breakfast. Breakfast is the standard 4 sar hotel fare. It does though most of the cooked food tends to be more in line with asian tastes - not even beef bacon. The freshly cooked eggs are very good! The rooms though on the small side are very clean, well maintained, good flat screen tv but only 5 channels for english speakers, 2 sport, disney, bbc and movie station. The pillows are excellent bu those who prefer a softer bed will find the beds very unforgiving - my wife prefers a hard mattress and found it a non issue - opoosite for me. The hotel pool is an aceptable area - it is though not an inviting area, few plants, starting to show it has not been maintained in a while and very few lounge decks. If you are lucky enough to get one they are very comfy. We found all but 1 of the staff to be very friendly and helpful - especially the waiters in the restaurant. The lifts are quick and efficient. The hotel is attched to a very large shopping Mall. The mall has a lot of shops but not many shoppers! It has a few good things for children, bowling, internet games and a very good picture theatre with latest release movies - very cheap! There are no quality restaurants, the KK food blog are correct when they say that most of the restaurants are 2 to 3 stars out of 5! There are the usual food chain restaurants from KFC, Pizza Hut to malaysian chians such as secret reicpe.
