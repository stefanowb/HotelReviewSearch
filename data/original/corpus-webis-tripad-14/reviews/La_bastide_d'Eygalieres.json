The room (#10 - a premium cost corner room, a little larger, beautiful views) was perfect, and the dinners we had at the hotel were exceptional. The pool was cold, so only brave souls partook of it, but we enjoyed many afternoons beside it. Our friends were next door in room #8, and they were just as pleased with their accommodations. Breakfasts were robust and good. The proximity to Eygalieres meant it was a nice walk to town or a very short drive. And what a great little village!

Saying, \"You can't miss it\" just didn't cut it for us, since we got lost both times we relied on his directions. We commented on this while there but maybe to no avail. At least ask.
