The location is good - quiet at night, but right next to the S Bahn station with easy links all over the city. There is a shop in the station where you can buy cold drinks and snacks which are cheaper than using the mini bar. There's also a good licensed restaurant/cafe open all day from breakfast, called the Giraffe, with a nice outside seating area. Its just under the railway arch past the back of the local burger king. There is also a flea market right outside the hotel on Saturday and Sunday - a bit junky but interesting to wander around. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are a very good size and offered separate shower and bath. A couple of things to note: We were a group of 6 people and the lifts will only let you travel to the floor that your room key is programmed to which can be a bit annoying. The aircon is a bit tame on a hot day and the bar prices are a little steep. However the bar area is lovely and there's outdoor seating too. All in all, a very good choice at a very reasonable price. You could do a lot worse. I probably wouldn't recommend for those wanting to be in the middle of the night life though.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "LInksfahrer", "date": "July 16, 2007", "id": 8126357}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a New Year", "text": "What a fantastic location for a New Year break in Berlin.

We wanted to be near the main festivities for new years Eve and we had a 20 to 30 minute walk towards the Brandenburg Gate area where there was a huge party taking place. We took the train from the airport at Schonefeld directly to Tiergarten and the hotel is just across the road from the station. The trains are cheap to use and we had access to most areas within the city in a matter of minutes.
