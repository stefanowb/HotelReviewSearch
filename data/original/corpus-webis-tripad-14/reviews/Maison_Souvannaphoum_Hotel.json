It was a great treat! We booked through the hotel website and immediately received a response. We arranged for airport pickup and were greeted by a staff member and given hot towels on the ride to the hotel. Once we arrived we were given a delicious ginger tea while we waited for our room. We also took in some spa services. The staff and service at this hotel were by far the best I have ever experienced. The room and the hotel itself were stunning and conveniently located to the night market and many temples.

I stayed in the low season and got a good rate and was upgraded to the Maison Suite which is huge. The staff are very frindly, professional and always on top of things. The breakfast buffet was excellent and included seasonal mushrooms which are a real local delicacy in summer. The grounds are neat and well groomed and all in all I would highly recommend this hotel. It is a ten minute walk from the action or a short tuk-tuk ride. My only complaint is that the air conditioner was too loud. In this day and age of highly efficient machines, it shouldn't be loud. That said, I would strongly recommend this hotel in the off season because of the great value. In high season when prices are also high, you should do your homework and check out other hotels as well. The biggest plus to this hotel is that it is a well-run, smallish, non chain-like hotel in the European tradition. Don't go expecting a five star chain and you won't be disappointed. I would give it a solid four stars.", "title": "Great Hotel", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Abbyx007", "date": "August 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5555396, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Food and staff professionalism.", "disliked": "\u2014 Loud air conditioner."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Service!", "text": "The Maison is a really wonderful property!
