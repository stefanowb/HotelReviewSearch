We choose this hotel again because we were at WDW for Marathon Weekend, and the proximity to the race start was a plus. Like others reviewers, we completed the on-line check-in, only to find that there is no expedited, separate station at the Boardwalk. As a result, I waited in the same long line as everyone else. I did receive a view upgrade (without asking), which was wonderful until I see the rusted windows and obvious leaking and wallpaper destruction underneath. (This did take away from the view of the courtyard just a bit...) HOWEVER, the most disappointing and unacceptable part of this stay was the fact that THERE WAS NO HOT WATER IN OUR ROOM. Imagine running at 5:30 am, at 45 temperatures, coming back for a nice hot shower, and finding less than lukewarm water. I initially received no response from management, and called back after waiting for 3 hours for maintenance- time not spent at the parks. After 6 additional calls, someone did come up, and the engineer did admit to me that \"one of their boilers was down\". It wasn't until the following morning that we had hot, hot water, and not a single manager called back to check if our problem was resolved.
