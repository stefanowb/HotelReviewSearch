Beach included with all the necessary amenities. It is a place to relax and let the hotel staff pamper you. We were particularly satisfied by the unconditional assistance received from the local advisor team. They assisted us with splendid results in findings from classical concerts at nearby locations to a diverse sample of exquisite local restaurants from different cities. Breakfast was delicious and is served in a beautiful dinning area. The only place for improvement we believe to be the pizza served in one of the restaurants.
