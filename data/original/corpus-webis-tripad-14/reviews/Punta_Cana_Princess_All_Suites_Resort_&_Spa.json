We are both in our sixtys, and just didn't realize what an all inclusive, adult only vacation could be. Although my husband ended up with the flu, the size of the Punta Cana Princess was just what we needed. The Princess is a smaller resort and was so easy to get to the pool or the beach without a long walk. Just what the Dr. ordered. There is lots to do if you are wanting adventure from swimming with the dolphins, snorkeling, tubing. We could lay around the pool and tan or sleep in the shade, we could always find a spot at the beach and watch the people or swim. The service was beyond expectations. It didn't matter if it was water, or a drink, the friendly staff was always there to assist. The ala carte restaurants were an adventure in fine dining. Although the language was a small barrier, it was not hard to explain with gestures and a small dictionary that we had a bad stomache and they adjusted my husbands meals accordingly. We had alot of fun at the Domincan Restaurant at the Caribe. The staff was fun to be around and they certainly enjoyed their work. The Steak at the Tex Mex at the Punta Cana Priness would give our good Alberta beef a run for the money. The amount of ala cartes allowed was terrific but we found that we enjoyed eating at the buffet as the food there was also great. The work and effort put on by the resort was greatly appreciated. The whole buffet area was moved to the beach for a beach party one evening and the meal was to die for. The cleanliness of this resort is at least 10 **********. It didn't matter if you used their public washrooms or your own suite, they were spotless. The grounds were gorgeous and the grounds keepers just fade into the landscaping keeping it in beautiful shape. Although my husband was ill for the first 2 days I felt right at home wondering around the resort on my own even going for meals in the evening and never once was worried about my safety.", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "SixtiesLady", "date": "February 26, 2007", "id": 6843235}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We took the trip to Manaiti Park and were treated with the same hospitality as the Hotel.
