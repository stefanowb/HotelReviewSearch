Absolutely amazing. Wow factor as soon as entering the hotel! Philip Starck design in an excellent mix with traditional Venetian atmosphere. Colors are rich and warm. The beautiful Venetian (Murano) chandeliers are spectacular. Fantastic mirrors in all sizes everywhere. Furniture, decoration, glass sculptures, vintage objects \u2013 all items are so thought through. And yet, it is extremely cozy and welcoming. The Krug lounge is special with its furniture and d\u00e9cor combined with great views over the Grand Canal. The terrace on the second floor is charming. Although no great views, it\u2019s a relaxing place to sit down at with a glass of spumanti or having your breakfast in the morning. Talking about breakfast, another great invention to serve \u201cat any time or place of the hotel\u201d! Walking the way to our room was a delight. The hallways are wonderfully decorated with large framed pictures standing off the walls, art pieces and grand backlit Venetian mirrors along the walk. Stunning! Our room (which \u201clowest\u201d category) was of very good size with a large bathroom. Obviously the d\u00e9cor and design in line with what we had already experienced. Large backlit mirrors, warm dimmer controlled room lightning, design furniture and a modern bathroom in natural stone. TV is hidden in the mirror in front of the bed. IPOD plug next to the bed with ceiling speakers in room and bathroom. Bed was ultra comfortable. Although no views, which a pity, however only believe there are some suites with Grand Canal view.", "title": "Gorgeous hotel - but with room for improvement", "user": "LoveGrandHotels", "date": "August 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 76421793}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Personalized service with a very attentive and polite staff. Easy check-in over a welcoming glass of prosecco or cup of coffee. Breakfast was basically anything you could wish for. A perfect location. There is a gondola service taking you over to the other side of the canal, which is very convenient. Hotel price fairly good for Venice, although everything consumed in the hotel is expensive!

The property itself is gorgeous, although would be a bit too Philippe Starck for those not familiar with his incredibly contemporary and chic designs. In other words, I liked it, but my elderly parents would not for sure. Absolutely great arrival service. Welcomed to the lobby bar for canap\u00e9s from the chef and a welcome drink of our choosing. Very nice and relaxing! Check in is done in the bar seated 1-on-1. No traditional front desk here. Location is excellent, right on the Grand Canal but far enough away from the touristic chaos that is so much a part of Venice these days. [BTW, a little off topic, but I\u2019m through with going to Venice. Been there a few times now and it\u2019s SO touristy and SO SO off the charts expensive that I might as well go to Italy in Epcot and have a better time. Everyone should see the place once, but the prices are so insane for everything, from shopping to food to even a 17 Euro bottle of beer! Simply outrageous! The whole town was a bit of a letdown after a couple of prior visits.] Back to the hotel now. We occupied the cheapest room, and being new, it was very nice. The room itself was small (I\u2019d say about 130 sq feet or so), and the bathroom was just about as big as that I\u2019d say. So all in all it was comfortable for a 1 night stay. Now the bad part\u2026 as other reviewers have mentioned, the electronics in the rooms are a nightmare. Lights went on and off without doing anything. This was a MAJOR pain in the neck. I could deal with it, but older/less sophisticated travelers would be extremely frustrated with all of the inoperative modernization. When you told the staff about it, they acted surprised and said they\u2019d look into it\u2026 all the while knowing I\u2019m sure that there are issues since many of the reviews here already point this problem out. The air conditioning temp could not be controlled from the room. You had to call downstairs to have them adjust it for you via their \u201ccomputer\u201d so I was told. The shower door was improperly installed and will break sooner than later if not corrected. One good slam shut and there will be glass everywhere (yes, I reported this to the staff). And I did not care for the bathroom infinity sink. Nice to look at but water splashed everywhere on the countertop, walls etc. The mirror was also not positioned directly above the sink so it made shaving and some other tasks a small challenge. As for food, only had the welcome canap\u00e9s (excellent) and breakfast in the morning (included in the rate and very tasty and deluxe \u2013 if not in your rate, it\u2019s 38 Euros per person!). Late night bar service was good \u2013 but again those prices, 30 Euros for 4 beers (but better than the aforementioned 17 Euro per bottle price that you\u2019ll find near San Marco square). Now here is a weird thing. We stayed on a Friday night in mid-August, the height of the tourist season. There were far more staff working than hotel guests. I\u2019d say only about 4 rooms were booked from a comment I overheard from a hotel staffer. The place was eerily quiet. Would I say here again\u2026 probably not unless there was a great rate/offer and the tripadvisor reviews steadily improve.", "title": "Best hotel in venice", "user": "autolink", "date": "June 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68176560}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Palazzina Grassi was quite a disappointment to us.
