First, the troubles...I booked a night by internet and arrived the next day for our room. We had mistakenly booked the night before. I hoped that we could then pay the extra for the night that we did show up, but the manager was completely rude and basically said tough on you. Rather than work with the customer, she preferred to alienate us. The hotel was nearly empty, off season next to the beach, but no chance we could work this out. The room was okay, but there was a dredger just outside the hotel making noise until late in the night.

It's part of the charm. This one was not as old as many. It was well cared for and we enjoyed our stay. The Embarcadero Inn is right on the Embarcadero .. across the street is water! Its at the south end, about 5 minute walk away from all the shops/touristy areas. This is really a great location - close enough to walk on over, but not have to deal with the parking, or noise of it all. I think all the rooms have water views, which is nice.

We got a decent price for the room, and I felt like it was a good value. The room was pretty nice, dated, but nice and comfortable. We had a King size bed, table and a chair, small frig, microwave, dresser & old style tv. Small balcony with a couple chairs, and the best part was that the hotel jacuzzi was right across the hall. The bathroom was a typical small hotel bathroom. Nothing special, but it was clean and had great water pressure. I did like the fact that the shower/toilet were in a separate little room so you could close that door for privacy, while someone else used the sink area. The shower curtain was very thick rubber/plastic of some sort - it was driving me nuts because it kept hitting you as you are in the shower, but thats just a nit picky thing.

Clean room, prompt service. Shampoo and soap came through dispensers which while not greatly appealing, was tolerable. Good bed and pillows. Continental breakfast with standard items was on the 3rd floor and helped us from having to look for breakfast elsewhere in the morning. Didn't use the available Hot spa but when we took a look it was neat and deserted. My only problem is with the partial view of the QQ room that we booked. We went on a week day and paid $155.00 for the night. The excuse of a view we had was the tip end of a sail boat and the water around it that was barely seen through the slits of the buildings right in front and the full view rooms jutting on both sides of the balcony from the same building. Even that was impeded by a large crane from an ongoing construction. We stayed in room #212. So at least for the 2nd floor rooms b/n the full view rooms with the bldngs in front should not be described as having any view. The nearness to Embarcadero street and the Bay itself was pretty good and we enjoyed our stay. Pelican Grill next door served a decent dinner and Giovanni's Fish Market all the way at the end of the street stood up to its reputation for fresh fish and chips. I like it when the batter is thin. Estero, Anderson Inn, Gray's Inn etc are on the water side of Embarcadero street and Embarcadero Inn was on the opposite side. To be fair the Inn has no control over how the buildings come up on the other side I guess. So if you are expecting to enjoy any partial view I will not recommend it but otherwise the stay was good. We drove to the beach which is at walkable distance and external showering up facilities was after was better than Monterey. The place itself and the streets reminded me a little of Carmel/Monterey. Natural History Museum was wonderful. We plan to make another visit when the Monarch Butterflies arrive. It is also a great place for bird watching. Morro Rock is spectacular and can be seen in many states throughout the day due to the coastal fog.
