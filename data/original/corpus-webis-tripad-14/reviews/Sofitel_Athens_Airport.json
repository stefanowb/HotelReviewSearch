As another reviewer my only complaint was the lack of hair conditioner and that breakfast was not included in the cost of the room. Very friendly staff. There are restaurants in the airport if you don't want to eat at the hotel. We ate a snack in the bar at night with delectable twice fried chips and a very fresh Greek salad. We ate the mid range breakfast for 12 Euros and were able to choose from a very wide range of bakery products, cheeses, meets, fruits and yoghurts plus as much coffee as required. We had booked a private transfer through Viator - which was seamless. Hotel also gives you 15 min. of free internet on their lobby computer. Spa/indoor pool area also - although we investigated we didnt use it.. There was absolutely NO noise from the airport and we had a room facing the airport. Nor was there any light, so much so that when you wake up it could be any time of day!

We were really excited due to the high rating on here and how Sofitel is known for being a \"luxury hotel.\" Man oh man were we disappointed. the lady who was checking us in barely spoke any english and kept talking to us in Greek. I understand that is their language, but when you work at the ONLY hotel at the airport I suggest putting people on who speak different languages. Once we had muddled through our check-in we went to check out the room. relatively big, soft beds. marble bathroom (bad idea). we then headed back to the airport to have dinner at the olive tree (like many of you suggested) and grabbed some yummy-looking pastries from the bakery on the first floor of the airport. I wanted to send an email to my family saying we made it to Athens safely, so I went on their wi-fi network to find out we only had 15 minutes of access. more than that was some ridiculous fee (maybe 18 euro, I don't really remember). So, we found that cheap and tacky. Next, we went up to the spa/pool for a swim. it was nice, but rather small and bland. full children splashing around, even due to the late hour of the day. when we were done we went back to the room and both wanted to shower and go to bed. Dad goes first and heads to bed since it is late. I go next and I need to do things like shave my legs. I sit down on the seat that is in the shower and there is a brown slimy mould everywhere in the shower/tub area. it was revolting! (I'll post pictures) I wanted to change rooms but due to the late hour (11pm) and my dad already asleep I decided it would be best to talk to the front desk staff in the morning. I talked to the front desk staff in the morning and he was SO unbelievably rude (his name was nikolas I think). he said there was nothing he could do and did not understand how inconvenient it would be to change rooms at 11pm at night. He said there was NOTHING he could do, even though I was visibly upset. he didn't even try to offer us free breakfast. he didn't even bother giving us an apology. I expect much better service and standards from a \"luxury hotel\" it is disgusting and I plan on writing to the company to complain about the staff and the lack of cleaning standards. NOT impressed. stay here if you must, but you won't get what you paid for. :(", "title": "NOT a luxury hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "stephiesquirrel", "date": "October 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 119676005}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here on our way out of Athens.
