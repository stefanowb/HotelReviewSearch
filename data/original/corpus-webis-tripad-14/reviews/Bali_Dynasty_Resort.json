Bali Dynasty would have to be the nicest hotel Ive stayed at so far. The room was beautiful, I couldnt find fault with anything. It was very spacious and had a dividing door between us & the kids which was great at night when they went to bed, we could close the door and watch TV without keeping them awake. The room had 2 flat screen TV's, DVD player & Playstation with games. The bath towels were thick & white, the beds were huge and comfortable, with thick comfy pillows. The decor was modern & bright. The room had a small fridge, kettle, glasses, coffee cups, tea, coffee & sugar. Bottled water was provided each day for free. There was a large wardrobe and plenty of draw space for our clothes. We were on the ground floor overlooking the garden and it was so quiet, there was no noise from surrounding rooms. The airconditioning was perfect, not too cold and very quiet.
