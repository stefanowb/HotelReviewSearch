The area is filled with new construction, but is rather devoid of restaurants or other attractions. I didn't have a car in Bahrain, but I found that I was about a twenty minute walk from the Bahrain Mall, or a fifteen minute walk in the other direction from the Dana Mall. Unfortunately, dining choices are limited if you want an alternative to the hotel restaurant, although it really wasn't bad. Each mall offers the usual franchised fast food courts, but the other choices were only an Applebee's at the Bahrain Mall, or a Chili's in the Dana Mall. Not exactly fine dining, or even interesting local dining.", "title": "Service is a Problem", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "joeb1249", "date": "November 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10740695, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Modern room decor", "disliked": "\u2014 Continual service breakdowns"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled solo", "text": "The staff was pleasant enough, but from the beginning of my stay, there was a steady stream of service problems that were annoying.
