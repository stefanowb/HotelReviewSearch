First, it is in a very, very dirty part of town. On the outside the windows look like they haven't been cleaned since 1970, and the decor is the same inside. Old, faded, and extremely CREEPY! It is NOT \"charming\" for a high rise to be this way, even in this part of the country. Lastly we must not forget waking up to \"something\" crawling next to me.
