A bit difficult initially to find as hidden away behind a row of shops built in what was its main entrance! The hotel is enchanting. The staff on the desk were friendly and very helpful. There were four of us - two couples, arriving at different times and leaving on different days! Thought that might give them problems - but everything went perfectly. We had rooms on the top floor with large (but basic) balconies - unexpected but most welcome. The rooms were both lovely, clean and with everything you needed. Breakfast was super. A great continental buffet breakfast with plenty of everything, constantly refreshed. The dining room is small, so best to get there early just to make sure of a seat. Ten minutes walk to the Promenade des Anglais and all attractions. Five minutes walk from the bus station - 20 minutes from rail station.", "title": "Lovely, friendly hotel in good location", "user": "weefyuk", "date": "October 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 46943263}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed for 3 nights.

My husband continued to ask for something better and we eventually got an excellent room on 5th floor...Room 504...worth mentioning!!!! A huge and lovely bathroom, a tiny hallway for coats...a huge balcony with table and chairs( if we'd wanted breakfast in our room for example. ) A fair bit of space for moving around and a light and airy room. We were delighted!!!!! It has to be said however that there was a problem with the occasional ant...they must have lived in the walls...and got through the cracks...which we eventually tried to block as well as we could!!!! There was tea/coffee facilities as well which is unusual in a French hotel from our experience. Hotel staff very pleasant and helpful! The breakfast was excellent although the breakfast lounge was too small for the numbers using it. It was continental breakfast but with cereals and yoghurt in addition.
