The room was spacious and had a small sitting area with chairs plus a beautiful armoire to hold our clothes. The decor was very romantic - kind of vintage. The best thing about the room was the bed - it was almost a king size and hands down it was the most comfortable bed we slept on in Italy. At first we thought it was a tempurpedic mattress, but I don't think it was. At any rate, I have back problems and I slept great each night. The other winning point for me was that the place was spotless and very well kept. I also noticed that there were lots of places to hang things up as opposed to other hotel bathrooms. This may not seem like a big deal, but I don't like to put my stuff on the floor and for the first time (esp. in the shower) I didn't have to. These small things added to my comfort.

The building is one of many fine structures sandwiched along a cobbled road near the river that runs through town. And it's in a great location: just far enough from the huge cathedrals and Medici castle so that it's not thronged by the crowds (which never seem to dissipate--said fully aware that we constituted part of that infinite crowd during our stay).

Maybe not a big deal. Once you get into the inn, on the second floor, it's striking how beautifully appointed the place is: mild and tasteful medieval decor, with low lighting, and a general atmosphere that itself is almost worth the cost of the room. You'll feel like you're in a tranquil abbey just sitting by the innkeep's desk receiving your key. As every other review here attests, the couple running the place are indeed a fantastic pair: cordial, considerate, and quick to share names of places to eat and stroll. We tried all the eateries they suggested, and they were all fantastic (and all within a ten minute walk). And more: I was trying to find a particular place which neither of them had heard of, but the fellow, un-hesitating, got out a few books and in no time had located the place I was seeking.

Almost too massive, if that makes sense. It was as if they'd placed a bed in a huge converted dining room; although of course I don't mean to say there was a table and settings; it was just an odd room to be sleeping in, probably not a bedroom in the flat's former incarnation. And here began the sense of being less in an inn, more a guest in someone's large and exquisite home. There was no phone in the room, no bedside clock, no television (and of course many will tsk tsk my mentioning this ommission...but frankly I like having the choice of watching the evening news or not, and don't appreciate inns that make this choice for me); and no air conditioning or fan. This last bit would be fine if you could sleep with the windows open, except that we tried doing this and the screenless windows resulted in a misquito-party buzzing around our ears through the night. The next night we kept the windows closed, and it was a bit tight with no circulation, even in a room so generous. There was a bed, a few chairs, and a wardrobe. It was elegant, and the bed was fine, but the room itself was...uncomfortable.

You receive a skeleton key to your room...but you must return the key to the innkeeper whenever you step out. And so when you return to the hotel from wherever you've gone, you must get your key back from the innkeep in order to enter your room. It strikes me as being terribly inconvenient for the innkepper to have to constantly be on alert for guests in need of their keys, or in need of handing-in their keys. Now, the innkeeps were always nearby, and so we didn't have to wait at all for the key: but it was just odd that you continually had to hand the thing in and get it back. And you only receive a key to the building's front door if you're going to be out later than 10pm: before then, you must buzz for entry. Every time. The result is that we found ourselves not returning to the hotel as often as we might have, and staying inside sometimes instead of running down to the cornerstore as we might have, simply because of this odd key situation and the akward sense it imparts of \"being a bother\" if you were to need a series of in-and-out jaunts. The whole thing could be remedied by simply giving guests a set of front and room door keys to retain during their stay...as does every other hotel/inn I've ever visited. This place does not.

Before we travelled they had helped us with advice, and reserved a slot at the Uffizi for us (a must if you plan to go, because you totally avoid queueing). And then, when we got there and asked about somewhere for lunch, Alessio produced his own personal list of favourites and talked us through it, marking places up on a map, and even making reservations on our behalf. And these were out-of-the-way gems frequented by locals and tourists fortunate enough to have had advice from someone like Alessio.

You hand in your key to one of them when you go out, and they let you in by the buzzer outside and hand you your key when you enter. They live right there in a private area, so you are in a way a guest in their home. This was fine for me as a 72 year old single male, who likes the feeling that if I didn't return someone would come looking for me! The single room was spare, in an old Italian antique fashion, with huge ceiling and sink and bidet. It was abit dark, but one is rarely there except to sleep. It had a unique atmosphere. I enjoyed a number of meals at the excellent restaurant they recommmended nearby at really good prices. I loved the street it was on...very stylish and nice shops and friendly people. The owner got up at 6:15 am to help me into a waiting taxi for the train. All in, I would not hesitate to go back, and probably would pay abit more for a private bath.
