They told us that it was impossible and we just had to take what was available when we arrived. And when we arrived three months later the new part off the hotel was full , off course\u2026.and the room we had to stay in was really really old and next to the road. We had to sleep with ear plugs\uf04c the hotel staff are rude and not helpful at all. I would only recommend the hotel if u can get a room in the new part away from the road.

One female and two older male staff were certainly not doing much for public relations for this hotel. Any question was too much for them. They seemed to have a little English but had no interest in using it. As soon as you asked them a question it seemed that they had a one word answer ready and then they turned away and left you standing there.On reading the adds for this hotel it seemed to have everything we needed for our 5 day break, Close to city, near the beach, swimming pool, minibar etc. The location was good just about 20mins walk from city centre and quite near the beach. We had asked for a room on the lower floor and when we arrived we found we were on the 6th (Top) floor. When we asked if there was anything else we were told no so we said we would see the room anyway. The first thing that struck you when you got out of the elevator on the landing was the smell. It was a strong musty/damp smell and it was also there to a certain degree in the bedroom but not as bad. We think it may have been caused by the condensation from the drinks machine on the landings maybe making the carpet damp. Some days the smell was so bad we just took a deep breath as we left the elevator and ran to the bedroom so we could take the next breath. The room was clean but basic and dated the balcony door did not lock (they did fix this without delay) there was no door on the safe in the room and no sign of a minibar (this didnt matter we were not really drinkers anyway) When we went back to reception and mentioned the smell in the room they said they would have an airfreshner spray used.
