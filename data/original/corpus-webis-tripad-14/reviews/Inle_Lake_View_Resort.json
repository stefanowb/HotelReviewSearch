The rooms are modern and clean -- not quite 5 stars, but still better than most other places in Myanmar. Each room has a balcony or deck with gorgeous views of the lake. The restaurant is wonderful -- fairly pricey by Myanmar standards, with 3 course meals running around US$14, but the food was absolutely delicious - try the homemade coconut ice cream! The staff are a bit inexperienced and, as a result, the service is not quite up to international standards. However, they were so sweet and tried so hard to be accommodating, that it is difficult to be critical. One thing to note is that the hotel is in the middle of no where, and there is no swimming pool or gym (although spa facilities are available). The tv reception is also pretty bad, so if you are easily bored, then I would recommend bringing a good book, game boy, portable dvd player, etc. Otherwise, once it gets dark, there is very little entertainment around. Finally, if you stay at the Lake View, try to find a little time to walk around the village directly behind the hotel, especially around 4 pm, when the children are going home from school. The villagers are so friendly and the children so charming that my interaction with them was one of the highlights of my trip.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Rabidpuppy", "date": "September 21, 2004", "id": 2589004}], "location": {"country": "Myanmar", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Taunggyi"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 21, "very good": 50, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 101}, "aka": "Inle Lake View Hotel Taunggyi", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
