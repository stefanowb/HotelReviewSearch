There were a number of \"preferred\" hotels that the organisers recommended including the Hard Rock and the Radisson but I am convinced this was the best choice. The room was an excellent size, clean, comfortable with good amenities (although a walk-in shower would have been preferable to one in the bath). Wi-Fi in the room has to be paid for but I either used the free Wi-Fi in the lobby/bar or at the conference centre itself. Breakfast was good (with lots of fresh fruit) although the dining room did get very full at certain times. Situated between the financial district and the old town the location is spot-on and taxis are cheap if you don't want to walk. But above all else the view from my 14th floor room, both at night and during the day, was just superb.", "title": "Amazing views in a great location", "user": "BigMac58", "date": "November 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 186365674}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled on business", "text": "top location, loved the sea view from my room and my morning runs on the cinta costiera...", "title": "loved the sea view", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "alguccia", "date": "November 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 185731203}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with family", "text": "big room and bathroom, nice staff, will definitely visit again. probably a bit noisy so try to get a high floor room (16+)", "title": "Excellent location & Services for Panama", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mike J", "date": "November 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185532519}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Staff was very helpful, the restaurant & room service was great. The breakfast & Lunch buffet is to die for, along with the view, ambiance and live piano music is the icing on the cake. Also has a great pool & Gym with all sorts of cardio classes through out the day along with the spa for sauna and massages. Used the travel agents located in the hotel to book a tour of the Panama canal and the rain forest along with a ride on the zip lines, which turned out to be a lot of fun!
