Had arranged for an early check in and confirmed the room type and early check in the day before. Upon arrival the room type and early check-in were not available...the front desk was totally inept. Advised us they would call us on our cell phones when the room was available and estimated a delay of about an hour...Three hours later when we called them the room was still not available...and also was not smoking as we had requested or a King bed...we eventually received the suite we had arranged...It was a very nice room...Mardi Gras Suite...nice color scheme with subtle useage of purple green and gold( mardi gras) colors in the decor. flat screen TV, dining room table, sitting area, nice useage of marble in the bathroom ,wet bar...it faced a courtyard that had a bit of noise from a jazz group but it wasn't excessive. An apology for our being inconvienced would have been nice but it was never offered. I'll definitely stay here again...but only if I don't have an pressing plans or engagements and can afford to not have access to lodging till the evening of day of arrival.", "title": "Suite Sweet?", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ssful", "date": "April 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 7417356, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beautiful Marble", "disliked": "\u2014 The front desk was positively awful"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "This is one of the nicer Harrah's properties that I have stayed at. The rooms were beautiful, very well appointed. Being a diamond member of Harrah's Total rewards program, I was upgraded to s suite for free. The staff was excellent everwhere--front desk, housekeeping, valet, everyone!! The valet charges $25 to $35 per night to keep your car which i thought was high, but not uncommon for New Orleans. I love this casino. It so classy and upscale, yet so comfortable. The main bar in the middle of the casino is awesome. The only down side is that it's quite a hike to Bourbon Street.
