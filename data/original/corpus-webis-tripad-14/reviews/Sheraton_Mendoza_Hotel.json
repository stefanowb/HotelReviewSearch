Highlight being the outdoor decking area beside the indoor pool. Lovely to be able to catch some rays in the city. A short walk to the main street bars and restaurants. In house tour companies sell tours of the surrounding area's. Wonderful breakfast buffet. We took tours of the winerys nearest mendoza, didn't want to drive longer than 1 hour and the 3 we saw were very impressive. Also recommend the tour to the Andes, to the border of Argentina and Chile. There are nicer restaurants on the far side of the park from the main street and v. safe to walk there.

The breakfast was outstanding and provided a variety of delighfully presented choices. It was the perfect place to enjoy Mendoza due to its central location.

We felt the room and the hotel's pool area were great, as was the restaurant on the 17th floor with panaramic views of the city. The room is pretty large and the bathroom is spacious compared to most. The service at the front desk was great and we were treated well by a professional food & wine manager, Warren. However, most staff seemed somewhat inexperienced. I chose the hotel based on it's newness and my unfamiliarity with the area. After having spent 4 days there and having walked all over the central areas of town, I felt it was safe and the people very friendly. Unless money is no object, I would recommend a less expensive option (I paid $189 + tax = $239!/nt).

The internet was great and free in the lobby and very reasonable rates in the room. The front desk staff was great and when one of the computers had issues with printing offered me an email address and they scanned and sent everything to my Realtor and also faxed later after they printed it out on their front desk computers. The best part no charge for any of it. Not sure if that was a mistake or just part of the service. The cleaning crew was great and better than my housekeeper at my own apt. Staff was all so very nice it was amazing. The breakfast buffet was delicious and they were fast to fill up the coffee. Much better than the normal continental breakfast.

You won't notice it as the casino entrance is situated to one side, off the main lobby. Anyone who has stayed at a Starwood or Sheraton hotel anywhere in the world will know what to expect here. The rooms are standard, reasonably-sized, comfortable rooms, with good air-conditioning and nice bathrooms with good water pressure and amenities. Apart from a lack of English TV channels (as in most parts of Argentina) there were no nasty surprises. SPG Gold status members get a free upgrade to higher floor rooms with views towards the Andes. There are several free computers/wi fi situated near the main bar on the reception/main lobby level. There is a nice pool with sundecks, and the gym is surprisingly well equipped and large. The advantage of this hotel over its main competitor, the Park Hyatt, is that this is a high rise building with great views from rooms on the upper levels. Our room was on the west side of the building (i.e. the same side as the front entrance) and you get a nice view towards the Andes mountains and over the city. Like the Hyatt, this hotel is very close to the town centre where the shops are. The centre is marked by a pedestrian promenade with many stores, including tourists stores selling local handicrafts and leather goods. The pedestrian mall is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. There is a small store right across the road where you can buy bottled water and snacks and avoid the higher priced mini-bar. Unfortunately, all the good restaurants are closer to the Hyatt, which is a 15 minute walk away. Still, it is a pleasant walk and a great opportunity to people watch. Mendoza is a small, pretty, safe, leafy and walkable town with great weather in March. The hotel staff are friendly and efficient, and the breakfast buffet is more than adequate. It is a great place to base yourself for touring the wine area (and I highly recommend Ampora Wine Tours in this regard) and I enjoyed coming back here after a long day out. No complaints at all about this hotel. In comparison to the hotel prices at the Park Hyatt, the Sheraton is much, much better value and offers the same 5-star service and quality.
