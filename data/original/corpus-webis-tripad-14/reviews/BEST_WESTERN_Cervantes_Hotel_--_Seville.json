One day we walked to the Santa Justa train station which only took about 15mins too - we took a train to Cordoba which is just a 35min journey - well worth a visit too. All sites are within walking distance - just wear your (flat) sandals and stroll about and enjoy the sites. One more thing: don't bother packing dressy clothes - it's a very casual city.
