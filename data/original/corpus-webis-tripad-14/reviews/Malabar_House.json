The Malabar House is much more cheerful, unique and in a great location with many of the main sites in walking distance. The hotel is 15 years old and could use a few tweaks (replace bath tub, chalk bathroom, upgrade air conditioner) but really it was the nicest we saw. The food was also the best we had in Cochin but not as good as other places we visited in India. Dining outside in the courtyard was very pleasant with local live music. We also liked the bar.

Because we made a rather late decision to go to India, we made all the bookings ourselves, and took the Malabar House seven night package, staying at their various properties, including a night on their lovely houseboat, Discovery. This package is tremendous value, including half board, transportation between the different stops, a half day tour around Fort Cochin, a tasting of Indian wines, even an elephant ride. The hotel in Fort Cochin has been beautifully and sensitively restored and extended, and has a first-rate restaurant, with a mix of local and international cuisine. We had a ground floor room the first two nights, with an enormous bathroom and an outside terrace. On our last, extra, night we were upgraded to a suite on the first floor, even more beautiful and enormous, with a wrap-around terrace. The restaurant is mainly outdoors in a tropical garden, near the swimming pool. The staff were delightful to deal with and endlessly helpful.

The hotel is centered on a pretty courtyard with a small pool and an excellent restaurant \u2013 the best by a long shot of those we tried in Cochin. While the food quality and presentation was excellent, the hotel was licenced to sell only Indian wine and beer (an international beverage licence is expensive) this was a big disappointment because as much as we love Indian beer, the quality of wine does not stand up and often has an after taste.
