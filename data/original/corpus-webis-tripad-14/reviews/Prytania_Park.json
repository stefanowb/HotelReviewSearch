They have wonderful restaurants just a few blocks away. My wife and I decided to go to Bravo's on this trip. What a fantastic meal. We were able to walk there in less than 5 minutes and it was probably one of the best meals of our lives. No kidding. We had wonderful steaks, a fantastic lobster bisque and a creme brulee to die for. We got out for less than $55.00 without drinks. We also ate at Voodoo Barbeque and it was great. Have the pulled pork, corn pudding and chocolate cake. Delicious. It was less than a block from Prytania Park. I had to attend to business while in New Orleans, and I had left my laptop at the airport. The great front desk clerk, made multiple calls to the airport and found my laptop which was delivered before my meeting. A clean comfortable room with attentive staff.

New Orleans was our last stop on a 7 mth vacation. When we checked in we were greeted by a friendly and knowledgable staff. We checked into a wonderful two level \"loft\" room which had great space for our daughters who are attending school in New Orleans. We were thrilled with the price. Just $99.00 for a weekend night! Downtown hotels were $180.00 and up for the same nights! The room was both clean and inviting. The continental breakfast on the first morning was simple yet high quality. We ate outside in the wonderful courtyard which we just loved. On our second morning we went to the Blue Plate Cafe which was only a block away. What a delcious breakfast. It was one of the best breakfasts of our entire stay. One of the front desk agents also suggested Copeland's Cheesecake Bistro. We had serious complaints about that place. It was just too much delicious cajun food! Many other restaurants were also just an easy walk away. We picked up the streetcar just a block away and took it to Bourbon Street. The wonderful front desk staff also suggested the Cajun Pride Swamp tour. That was the best time. Drinking a daiquiri and watching gators. We had never seen a gator before except on a belt. Would we recomend the Prytania? Absolutely! Wonderful staff, clean rooms and good location.

The photos on the web showed a quaint and authentic New Orleans style hotel - just what I was looking to stay in for my first time to the city. My husband and I arrived with our two small children shortly after midnight. Driving up to the hotel, the surrounding area was a bit ominous. I thought we were staying in the Garden District? I guess they meant \u201calmost\u201d in the Garden District. We checked in and went up to our room exhausted from our long drive and ready to retire. Being so late we requested a different room. Although this one was cleaner than the first, it was still unacceptable. You say my standards are high? Well maybe, but let me just mention a few things I noticed and you be the judge. 1. Thick dust collected on the curtains 2. Wallpaper peeling off the walls. 3. Water stains on the ceiling. 4. Hairs on the floor in the bathroom. 5. The loft bedding was soiled with stains on the inner blanket and what I can only describe as dried up goop on the sheets. (I always pull back sheets to check for stains and bed bugs \u2013 Thank God I did) 6. I killed to small baby roaches in the bathroom/kitchen area (the dormitory size refrigerator and coffee maker are behind the bathroom door). Note: The room was cramped with all the furniture and if you are on the heavy side do not request the loft room.
