I couldn't affort it back then, so we decided to try it for a Valentine's Day getaway. We have been fortunate to stay in several nice hotels recently(like The Peninsula in Beverly Hills and The Carlyle in NYC) so I was interested to stay at Auberge to compare because Auberge is, by far, much more expensive. I had the same experience as a previous reviewer, in that the rate I was quoted on the phone was $100 more than the rate I found on the Internet, which was frustrating and unnecessary in my view. I also used the Concierge prior to my stay to book winery tours. She was very helpful and friendly and her follow-through was excellent. She also booked a couple of local restaurants, which was great but we did not have a car and had no idea it would be impossible to get a cab back to Auberge from St. Helena. One of the couples dining at the restaurant was kind enough to give us lift - make sure you have a car. We booked the cheapest room and got an upgrade at check-in. We had a terrace but could not see the Valley yet we liked the privacy. The complimentary snacks and bottle of wine in the room was a very nice touch, as was the nightly turn-down. The staff throughout the property was very friendly. The grounds are lovely; loved the sculptures and landscaping. We ate 2 dinners at the Bistro, which is more casual than the formal dining room but we much preferred it. We had reservations at the formal restaurant for Valentine's night, but sat down and saw it was a fixed-price, four course meal and we had had so much wine that we again opted for a cheese/pate platter & oysters in the Bistro. The staff at the restaurant did not make us feel at all uncomfortable about opting for the Bistro. We had very noisy neighbors two of the three nights during our stay. I mentioned it to the front desk manager our final morning and she followed up with me after we checked out and gave us a discount on our bill.

This place is all about the details (we even received a thank you card via mail at home!). The staff is great, always looking for the extra thing to make your day. There is a complimentary Mercedes rental program for guests as well. We stayed during the off season while they were renovating, but we barely even noticed the work -- even with them getting a new roof! We sadly left and headed to the next relais, but Auberge was the best of our week in Napa. The location is close to all the great food and wine locations but far enough away to make it seem like paradise where you are the only person in the world who matters. The rooms are full of natural light, and the beds are feather alternative and provide for the best sleep ever. The bathroom is divided, so the toilet is in a side area with its own door.

(On top of that the room was cleaned very late in the afternoon, just when we were ready to leave for dinner). We were so disappointed. I called the front desk and they explained that due to a large group they had no time to send someone! Really!!! Several minutes after my phone call an employee arrived with a fire log for the fire place and suggested that we light the fire ourselves and that the matches could be found on the mantle. Yikes.
