I was prompted to post a review after reading the negativity... The hotel is GREAT! Well maintained and the staff is used to dealing with guests that expect a \"catered experience\". We are BIG travelers and have stayed at many of the finest hotels in the world, and have always had a nice experience at the Bacara. The rooms are very clean, well appointed and unique, they don't feel like typical hotels rooms, as there are different room configurations and many buildings on sight. So there are no long indoor hallways, the individual buildings give a more intimate experience. The pool is pretty, and the view down the coast is relaxing. The only negative I would have is that the Bacara is a bit pricey, but not ridiculous if you are used to staying (and eating) at better hotels. And, if you are looking for a TRUE beach experience, the Bacara sits up on a bluff and the beach isn't that beautiful. But, none of the hotels in that area sit on the beach... I have stayed at the Four Seasons Biltmore, and their beach is across the street and not that beautiful either (a narrow strip of beach, nice for walking like the Bacara). The Bacara offers beach services and the Biltmore does not. Also, if memory serves me one cannot view the beach/ocean from the pool and very few of their rooms are ocean view. I also felt our food bill was probably 20% higher than your usual high end resort, although the food and service were very good. I felt the additional $150. for the weekend wasn't a big deal if one can afford the room rate. I don't know what the other posters are complaining about... maybe they are not used to high end resort prices? If you visit the area, I suggest eating outside at the San Yisdro Ranch, it was FANTASTIC. So charming and beautiful... we could have been anywhere... that was a real escape!

Secondly, after we arrived we had to wait for a hell of a long time to get checked in. Why, I don't know because there wasn't a whole lot of people in front of us. I did notice off to the side of us, a manager or somebody with some authority was giving an employee the third degree for something or the other. the poor kid looked ready to cry. I can't imagine dressing down someone right in front of your guests. Classless and tacky to say the least. our room was a huge dissapointment. For the price you pay, you expect something better than what you could find at any Ramada Inn. The walls are terrible. It's easy to hear everything going on in the next room. Also the food was mediocre at best and way way overpriced. The views are great if you like staring at rooftops. The beach was horrible. There was oil or some substance everywhere. I guess it's no coincidence that you never saw anyone swimming there. Also it's not very pleasant to try to take a walk on the property and be nearly run over by golf carts. I have to say that while some of the bell/valet staff seemed good, most of these guys look like they spend most of their time watching Beavis and Butthead. I presume they're college students. Probably not the best group to handle chores for a supposed five star resort. All in all this place was a huge dissapointment. You're paying a hell of a lot of money for not much.

When we first arrived the man at the desk told us we would have a room with two full-sized beds instead of the King that we reserved. We asked if there were any king sized rooms available and he said there were no rooms left at the hotel and we were stuck with the double beds. This resort is sprawling, with many out buildings and a very long hike to the lobby which is located on a rather steep hill. We were transported by golf cart to our room by a wonderful bellman named Paul. When we got to our room and expressed disappointment at the size of the room and the beds, Paul got on the phone to the desk and within five minutes (as if by magic) we had another room...this time a king, which was what we had reserved in the first place. We were very grateful to Paul, but disappointed in the unhelpful service we received at the front desk.", "title": "Overrated", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "catmac1957", "date": "May 25, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3499242}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "Our new room was spacious, but was on the bottom floor, very dark, and looked straight into another building.

You really don't have to ever leave the property: spa, ocean views, walking trails and paths, tennis, three pools, volleyball court, game house (doubles as the conference center), fitness and yoga classes, & three restaurants - five if you count the bar and room service. I didn't have a spa treatment but I did use the jacuzzi and steam room in the spa. The spa is just as nice as the spa at the former Ritz Carlton - Pasadena. The meals we had were very good, including the room service meal. The bed is so comfortable. My only complaint is that the resort was rather dark at night so we used our flashlights and there is a lack of signage at the resort and in Santa Barabara in general. This is a high-end resort so be prepared to spend lots of money, especially tipping and for food. The service is great. The room is done in California Mission meets the tropics style. It's not oppulent but the bathroom is great: a shower with a tile bench seat, a separate tub, toilet room, and a big counter for the sink area. As with all hotels, there is never enough lighting to read a book -- so bring a book light and your flashlight (for the paths at night) and you will be fine. In my estimation the room could have easily used three more light sources. But all in all we had a wonderful stay and will go there again.", "title": "Beautiful Time at Bacara in Beautiful Santa Barbara", "user": "simplify", "date": "January 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 23209821, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff provides exellent service.
