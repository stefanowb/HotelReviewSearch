The hotel is situated high above the bay of Naples in a quiet location with perfect views of Versuvius and beyond. It has only seven rooms and is very homely. When we arrived we were treated to home made lemonade and made to feel welcome. The room was spotlessly clean, as was everywhere else, the shower was excellent, the a/c worked very well and silently and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfasts always consisted of local produce and home baked cakes and savouries cooked that morning. Maria, Dorotea and Pasquale made us feel like part of a family and would always help with any request.

We were looking forward to our first trip to Sorrento, and on arrival got a taxi to the Villa as we weren\u2019t quite sure how to get there. The Villa is at least a 15 minute walk from the town centre and up an incredibly steep hill; however we weren\u2019t perturbed by this as we had read such good reviews about the Villa. After booking our 5 night stay 5 months in advance, on our arrival Pasquale announced that a \u201cmistake\u201d had been made, they had over booked and we would have to stay in a 4 star hotel up the road (Grand Paradiso Hotel). We were assured that this hotel was \u201cvery beautiful\u201d and that Pasquale would pay the difference to the hotel as it was \u201cmore expensive\u201d. I read past reviews of the Grand Paradiso Hotel as I wasn\u2019t impressed at all with the Hotel, a lot of reviews weren\u2019t favourable and understandably so. I duly enquired when I got to the hotel the price of this accommodation, there was indeed a difference of 50 Euro, I was quoted a price which was 50 Euro CHEAPER than the room we had booked at the Villa Oriana! We decided against kicking up a fuss over the price as we had 4 nights to spend at the Villa and thought it would be in our best interests to be as amiable as possible in light of this fiasco, however after arriving back to the villa, the family & staff made us feel very unwelcome and in general were quite rude to us. Pasquale also promised us \u201cthe best room in the house\u201d by way of compensation when he dropped us up to the hotel, to our detriment our room was literally right beside the front door and all we could hear was people coming in during the early hours of the morning and talking from 7 am onwards, we could not sleep as we kept being woken by the goings on and the traffic in the hallway outside our door, I would safely say this was one of the worst rooms in the house. We went to Sorrento for a break but left feeling exhausted, ripped off and baffled by the good reviews the Villa has received. Maria, the owner was indeed quite nice and made an effort to speak to us at breakfast like she did all guests but that aside I could not recommend this accommodation, it\u2019s exceptionally over priced and in no way convenient to the town of Sorrento\u2026.in a word\u2026avoid!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mgirishrover", "date": "October 10, 2007", "id": 10062256}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Villa Oriana is a wonderful B&B, owned and staffed by tremendously nice people. Within minutes of booking the reservation, we received a warm welcome and were treated to the same hospitality throughout our stay. Dorotea was extremely helpful in recommending local restaurants and setting up trips around the region. The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and spacious. The setting was lovely. Much of Villa Oriana's charm comes from Maria, the owner. She cooks delicious breakfast treats using ingredients from her own garden and lemon grove. And Maria is so warm and welcoming that you can't help but enjoy your stay.
