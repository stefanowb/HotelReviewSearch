Our room had a balcony overlooking the pool which was completely empty, apart from ourselves, for most of our stay. The hotel is well air conditioned and the staff speak good English and are very helpful. We paid a fraction of the price we would have paid for a hotel of similar quality in Britain. Montecatini itself is a lovely, interesting spa town. We stayed for four nights at the beginning of July 2005 and could have stayed for longer. The train to Florence takes about forty five minutes but we would recommend staying in Montecatini and in particular the Francia and Quiranale.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "flubadub", "date": "July 24, 2005", "id": 3697164}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Quiet in a relaxing town", "text": "Pretty room, clean and quiet.
