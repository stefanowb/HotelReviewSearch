The hotel has a great location; in the center of the old city Bratislava, where most attractions are within walking distance. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are clean, spacious and look newly furbished. The bathrooms are also clean and spacious. Our stay was also pleasant because of the helpful staff, whenever we called the housekeeping to ask for something they would get it in impressive speed, the concierge offered to park our rented car in the car-park near by, and the receptionist upgraded our room at our third stay in the hotel. If you decide to stay at the hotel, do not miss their breakfast, it was one of the best we have had in Europe. I'd say the hotel deserves 5 stars.

The historic centre is tiny, you could walk one end to the other in 5 minutes but it is really cute and there are a few good bars and restaurants there although it isn't overdone like, say, Prague. The Slang pub opposite the hotel does the best ribs I have ever had and all the restaurants are extremely good value.
