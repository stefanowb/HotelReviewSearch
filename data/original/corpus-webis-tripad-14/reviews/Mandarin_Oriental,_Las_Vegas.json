The lobby, room, and overall aesthetics are gorgeous. The room was very modern with very clever technology included. I read a few reviews about the glass window into the bathroom - just a tip, there is a screen that slides over the glass. I do agree that it is still not a private enough, even with a spouse, but it was really beautiful. I liked that everything you would need could be found in various compartments throughout the room - extra pillows and blankets in a beautiful box, etc. Despite the beauty, our first day at the pool had a major impact on our entire experience. The pool was highly understaffed and those that were there (with the exception of one gentleman) would disappear or avoid eye contact at all cost. We had to hunt down somebody to request a lunch menu. When we placed our lunch order (after another round of hunting), our drinks arrived after half an hour. After an hour passed, I went to the desk to inquire about our lunch and was dodged several times. After an hour and a half, our lunch order - one sandwich and one salad - arrived. Yes, it took an hour and a half to receive a $75 lunch that would take about 15 minutes to prepare. We were offered nothing as an apology. We heard all of the visitors around us having similar experiences. We decided to purchase nothing else at the hotel throughout the rest of our stay. On another note, there were several visitors on both days that did not appear to be hotel guests. The hotel needs to do a better job of ensuring all pool guests are hotel guests - we never had to verify proof of our stay or a room key. With a small pool size as the Mandarin offers, they need to be a bit more careful with security - there are a limited number of seats.
