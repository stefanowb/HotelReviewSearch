The rate was very economical (about Rp 200.000/night for double room) and first I was afraid the room would be terrible. However, my doubt was proven wrong! The room, though small, was very clean. The bathroom had nice shower. It was perfect because our plan in Bali was not to relax & linger all day at the hotel.
