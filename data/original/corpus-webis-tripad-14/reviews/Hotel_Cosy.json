The food and rooms are reasonable. We did not have a view from our room but we were only staying one night, so that is often the case. The breakfast was full and varied and the breakfast room is unusual but interesting and tastefully decorated. We were travelling by car so the steep hill was no problem, but it might be for others. The price was quite reasonable though on check out 11 euros had been added to our bill and I did not really get a satisfactory answer as to why.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Dexter48507", "date": "September 7, 2005", "id": 3847872}], "location": {"country": "Belgium", "region": "Wallonia", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 12, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 28}, "slim_ranking": 0.1}
