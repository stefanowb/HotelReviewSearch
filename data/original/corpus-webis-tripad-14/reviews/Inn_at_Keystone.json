The staff couldn't help me several times I needed assistance and if there is a problem they do everything they can to let you solve by yourself the problem. For example, the hotel claims that they provide free wireless internet access to every rooms but if you stay in a room in one of the corners of the hotel, then you can't get a sufficient signal and it is up to you (not to the hotel staff) to call the internet provider (which can takes more than 30 mins) to solve the problem.", "title": "Avoid this place", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bourets", "date": "January 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 6612602, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at the Inn for one night after sleeping in our truck for two days. I have to admit, we would have been happier spending another night in the truck rather than stay at the Inn. We paid over $300 for a room because it was during a holiday weekend. You would think at this price they would at least include breakfast. The room was decent, but the service was terrible. We called to ask how much it would be to stay another night and no one got back to us with an answer. The shower was terrible. I burned my head because of the fluctuation in temperature. The people at the desk were rude. Obviously, the Inn is making enough money to not be concerned about each individual guest.

Now for the \"dings\"...The slopes are more like 500 yards away, almost two foot ball fields and can be challenging in full gear. I now rent a locker for my shoes and carry my boots etc. There is a shuttle if you want to take it. Parking is a problem. We had to park across the street from the hotel; across a four lane boulevard that had no stop light and where cars whiz by at 45mph. There is no security for your automobile. There are a limited amount of spaces that are beneath/behind the hotel but there are not enough spaces to cover a weekday evening! Forget weekends. The restaurant is hit or miss.

The bed and the pull-out bed were both comfortable. The front desk was very friendly and polite and tried to help as best as they could. We ate breakfast in the downstairs restaurant and while it was good, it was a bit expensive for a small buffet ($11/person). The walk from the Inn to the lifts is not as long as some previous reviewers have stated. It takes about 5-10mins max, and if anything, helps you get your legs warmed up and ready to go for the day.

We took our two English Bulldogs and there were many other playmates for the girls! The staff is friendly, but not overly intelligent, so be patient. The restaurant has \"okay\" food, had to wait for the breakfast buffet on more than one occasion to be restocked. Room service was prompt, but food, again, just okay. Try the steakhouse at Keystone Lodge....Yum-o! The view from our room was spectacular!!!....to say the least! The room was clean and well stocked with amenities, which is a good thing when you are with pets because your room does not get room service unless your pets are not in the room. Totally understand the policy, but we had our dogs crated and they still would not service the room. They did, however, provide clean towels and coffee every day.

I told them that was unacceptable, we wanted access to a room with hot water and they told me I could come down and shower where the staff does. I told them for $150+ a night I did not think that was an acceptable solution. After several calls, nothing was resolved. They sounded more like stoned teens than adults being paid to assit guests. They refused to check other rooms to see if the problem was more widespread, they refuse access to an additional room with a shower so we could check, they refused refund. It went unresolved for the evening. The next morning I was in the elevator with a repair man who said the hot water heater had gone out and the entire hotel was out of hot water. They were not notified until morning when additional customers called to complain, which means the entire hotel was inconvienced, rather than resolving it the night before. We requested a discount since you stay at a hotel to shower & sleep and we were not able to shower, and the repeatable phones from the staff just to annoy us hindered our sleep. Nothing, told they need to speak to their manager (a repeatable excuse with every request for access to room with a hot water).
