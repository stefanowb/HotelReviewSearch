When we got there we were greeted by a charming woman and a lovely foyer, the hotel looked fantastic, and we were then congratulated on our wedding that day but received nothing? I know it's a little bad to shave points for not upgrading or something similar but we didn't receive a thing, no flowers, no champagne, no room upgrade, nothing! Everyone I know who stayed in a hotel on their Honeymoon has had something! The hotel was quite empty as well so a room upgrade would have been ideal! We shrugged this off and were sent up the lift to our room, after walking around the 3ft wide corridors for 15 mins sweating in the Parisian heat and lugging a 20kg suitcase around I went back down only to be told we were on the other side of the hotel on the top floor, there was no lift this time and we had to walk up stairs, we stayed optimistic and decided it was our honeymoon and we would forget that as it had been a long day.", "title": "Very good stay", "user": "searcher008", "date": "July 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35700672}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "We have just returned from a stay in this marvellous hotel.
