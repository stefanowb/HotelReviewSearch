In doing my reserach, the Arcotel Camino seemed liked the best option: close to the train station and city center, a brief train ride from Porsche. This was by far the most elegant hotel we stayed in during our two-week trip in Switzerland and Germany, for a reasonable price. We were in room 143 - a triple room, that had a double bed for my parents, and a double couch bed for me. The room was very spacious with high ceilings and a comfortable bathroom. As others noted, it is a brief 5-10 minute walk from the main train station in Stuttgart, but if you are towing a lot of luggage, take a 5 Euro cab ride (we walked with our luggage for our departure, since it was downhill). The local shopping/dining district is also within about a 10-15 minute walk. Since I was just off from a business trip and was keeping in touch with my husband at home, I was using the wired internet access they offered for free, which was spotty at best. You can pay to upgrade, but I tried to do that on my last morning there and it didn't work so well. Also, we checked out before leaving for our Porsche tour (which is an easy train ride from the main train station) and asked to leave our luggage in their \"secure luggage room\" - when we returned 5-6 hours later, it was still sitting on a cart in the lobby. We ate in their bar restaurant when we arrived - their main restaurant looks very nice, but you can only order their more expensive meals to eat there; if you want a sandwich or other casual dining, you need to eat in the bar. Overall, a very nice, comfortable hotel, and a quiet stay.", "title": "Great stop for experiencing the Porsche museum", "user": "pandah88", "date": "July 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35322817}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is very close to the Hauptbanhof, about 5 minuts walking, but far enough for being quiet and nice.", "title": "Great modern and nice hotel", "user": "parracule", "date": "June 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33056315}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "It's nicely decorated, with everythig that you can need.
