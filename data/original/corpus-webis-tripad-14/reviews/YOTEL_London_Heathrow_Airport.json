The Yotel is NOT located inside Terminal 4! You have to exit through immigrations and hunt hard to find it tucked away in an odd location outside the arrivals baggage claim area. It took me over an hour to get there from Terminal 3 and track it down (no one in airport knew where it was and it's not listed on and of terminal 4's maps or information boards). After finally finding it, I had to take a train back to Terminal 1 after my stay because the Yotel is located outside the inter-terminal bus transfer service. The cabin was nice, it was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. But I lost half the sleep time I was counting on (and paid for) just getting there, trying to find it, and then making sure I had time to get back to my terminal and go through security and immigrations once again. And then to top it off, the fire alarm warning system at the hotel malfunctioned and it went off every 20 minutes. Not the rest I had imagined between two 12-hour fights! Maybe if they get their bugs worked out AND I was flying in and out of Terminal 4, I may give it another shot. Otherwise, I'll just go get a day room at the airport Novotel as I have in the past.", "title": "not really IN the terminal", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Yakatack", "date": "March 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14360992}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "What a concept!

There was nice lighting, either bright light or soothing purple light. The bedding was soft and even the single bed had two pillows and a down comforter. The only major issue with layout was the bathroom - the wall was glass, and there was no door. When two people were sharing the room, there was absolutely no privacy for any of the 5 senses. The rainwater shower, on the other hand, was terrific with tons of water pressure and hot water. The soap provided was yummy.

Directly outside the Yotel is the Arrivals area in Terminal 4 of Heathrow Airport, inside the Yotel is a place of peace and tranquility. The lighting is a cool purple shade, and you check yourself in with terminals that even pop out your room card. The rooms themselves bring a new meaning to \"tiny European hotel room\", with barely enough room for one person to walk around. They are very new, clean and futuristic looking though. The double room has a double bed (that folds down with the touch of a button), a flat screen TV, small shelving with a table and chair tucked into it, and a full bathroom. All in the size of your closet at home! The single rooms are even smaller, with half of a bunk bed and a bathroom. You literally can't have more than one person standing in them at one time. This being said, the Yotel is perfect for anyone who arrives late at Heathrow or has an early flight. It takes about an hour to get to Heathrow from central london, or about 30 seconds from the Yotel. The Yotel brings sleeping convenience to a new level, and our family agreed that every airport should have one. There's nothing better after a long flight than to be able to walk in a few minutes to your hotel and be sleeping in no time. Even if you have a long connection, you could rent out the Yotel for a couple of hours and take a snooze. It should be noted that the Yotel is in Terminal 4, so if your flight arrives in any other of the terminals you'll have to take a free train that connects the terminals together to get to the Yotel.
