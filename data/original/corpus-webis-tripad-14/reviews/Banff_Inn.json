Other hotels in Banff were quite pricey and we didn't want to spend too much on this one, so booked a suite with 2 rooms. The hotel looks great on the outside and has underground parking. It is a 10 minute stroll to the centre of Banff. Our suite consisted of a main room with 2 double beds and kitchenette, a seperate room with double bed and a bathroom with the strangest light ever. It was on a timer and went out if you were in the shower too long. The room was clean, but very small and the window looked out onto a brick wall. The wall was so close you couldn't even see the sky to guage the weather for the day. The hotel has a hot tub which looks quite new and was very nice. I wanted to use the showers there rather than in my room. If you like a good breakfast don't bother with this one. Breakfast is cereal in plastic bowls, coffee in plastic cups and toast or a muffin on a plastic plate! This was fine for us as we only had a light breakfast. The hotel had no atmosphere. It was peak season and lots of people were staying there, but we never heard or saw anyone. No-one used the bar. It might be different in winter. If I come back to Banff I won't stay here again, but wouldn't tell other people not to. I would definitely pay the money for a few nights in the Banff Fairmont!", "title": "You get what you pay for!", "user": "MapleScotland", "date": "August 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 19044371, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Size of room"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled solo", "text": "Was forced to stay here as was bumped from another hotel where I had made a reservation.

First time was skiing with friends in December 2007, great deal for the loft, 3 double beds, perfect for a family. The hot tub is excellent for relaxing after a long day of skiing/snowboarding and the free breakfast is just right to fill up before a day at one of the hills. We skiied Lake Louise and the drive wasn't bad. The second visit was a girls weekend in February, had dinner at the Keg a block down and shopped the next day.

First thoughts of the hotel were good with a nice entrance with fire and welcoming front desk. The hotel was decorated nicely and not at all dark and dingy as some other reviews mentioned. The rooms were very nice and spacious withn all the facilities you need. There was a nice bar area which also served breakfast in the morning. The breakfast was a pretty basic affair, but as the hotel doesn't have a restaurant then you can't expect a full cooked breakfast. But there was a good restaurant two doors down that served a full breakfast if thats what you wanted. The hotel had locked storage for any ski's and also a big hot tub and steam room and sauna. The hotel is located about a 10min walk to downtown Banff where you can find some great bars and restaurants and plenty of shopping. Overall we really enjoyed our stay in Banff which has some of the best scenery we've ever witnessed, a truely beautiful part of the world. The Banff Inn was perfect for our needs and will definitely stay here again in the future.", "title": "We enjoyed our stay at the Banff Inn", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RogerMorris", "date": "March 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14030356, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of restaurant"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I honeymooned at the Banff Inn and loved it.
