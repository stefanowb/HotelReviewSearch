Everything about this hotel is special, the views from the hotel over Sorrento and the Bay of Naples are simply breathtaking. Arriving at reception you are greeting by very warm ,friendly and professional staff. We had booked a room at the front of the hotel with seaview unfortunately this was not ready but we were asurred we would be moved there after breakfast the next morning which we were and were given nice bottle of fizz to make up for it, it was a very minor thing and handled beautifully by Alberto. Even although we arrived late there was a lovely cold plate of food waiting for us in the room. Once in our own room the next morning we couldn't believe our luck, our balcony had the same panoramic breathtaking views and was very private. The best thing about Grand Paradiso though is the staff, they are all amazing and made us feel so welcome with nothing too much trouble. Lovely Lawra (hope my spelling not too bad) who seems to keep the whole hotel immaculatetly clean and always has a smile for you, Mekel (olympic standard cocktail maker) who is just a joy, his laughter fills the hotel when he comes to work. The lovely girls who assist him in running the bar so well.The always dapper Giuseppe who's easy charm makes dining at the hotel a lovely experience. All the boys in the resturaunt are very professional and are all characters, they make service so slick both breakfast and dinner were delightful. We also can't speak highly enough of the food at the hotel every meal we had was delicious and varied and to have table service instead of the usual buffet at dinner was a real treat. The courtesy bus is another brilliant service that the hotel provides and is excellent dropping off in the center of Sorrento, big thank you to Mario the driver and hats off to him for negotiating that tight bending road on a daily basis. We are hoping return to the hotel next year and will book the same room if possible or 404 might be our choice. We have wondrful memories of days spent around the pool taking in the amazing view and nights of great food, wine and good company. Once again a great big thank you to all at Grand Paradiso, you made our holiday perfect!!

The balcony view was of someone\u2019s back yard and the balcony floor itself was dirty. Having complained to the receptionists, they agreed to clean the room that evening and move us to another room the following morning. The following morning we were moved to another room (316), that again didn\u2019t meet our expectations or live up to the 4 star standard. The air con was noisy, the tv didn\u2019t work and the plug in the sink was stuck. The rooms themselves were generally very old fashioned (decoration) and looked nothing like the pictures on the hotel website. Very disappointing! This view was shared by several other residents who had encountered similar problems/issues. On a positive note, all staff including the restaurant staff (especially Guiseppe!) were very friendly, however the restaurant food lacked variation from evening to evening and lacked Italian cuisine. We found the hotel manager very rude, patronising and inconsiderate to our entitled needs/requests. The views from the pool are spectacular and Sorrento itself is a beautiful place and would highly recommend a visit to this city. Given the poor standard of this hotel we unfortunately can not recommend this hotel as a place to stay.

The hotel is clean, spacious and has beautiful art everywhere you look, including an art gallery underneath the restaurant. Our room was lovely, bright and and comfortable, and when I asked if the two twin beds could be made into a double bed, the staff did this straight away with no hassle. The pool area is amazing, with breath taking views of the whole of the Bay of Naples, Vesuvius and Capri - the sunsets every night were stunning. The pool bar was great, as was the restaurant for our evening meals - we had a three course meal each night and the waiters were really lovely. The only slight, slight issue for some people may be that the hotel is half way up a mountain! It's a very steep and winding road that we quite enjoyed walking down, but walking up was tough (and we are two quite fit 25 year olds!). The hotel do, however, provide a free shuttle bus service from the hotel doors to the centre of Sorrento and back about 12 times a day.

We complained immediately to the staff at reception who regrettably couldn't provide us with an alternative until the following day. The alternative was better, however being on the first floor directly above the main entrance did mean that it was quite noisy with the window open. The breakfast was ok, but keep clear of the waiters offer of coffee, the coffee from the machine at the buffet is much better. We can't comment on the evening meal as we tended to eat in Sorrento before catching the shuttle bus back up to the hotel. The shuttle bus is a Godsend at the hotel as it stands hish above San Agnello, and quite a walk down to Sorrento, let alone back up the hill. We were full of admiration for the bus driver who managed to negotiate the narrow lane down to San Agnello without hitting any of the parked cars, the side panels on the bus bear witness that it isn't always the case. The hotel, and the swimming pool in particular, has a superb panoramic view of the Bay of Naples fom Capri to Ischia, with Vesuvius looming in the distance. We flew with Easyjet from Bristol and due to it's late arrival in Naples didn't want to risk missing the last train from Naples to Sorrento. We booked our transfer with Giovanni of Johnny's Tours, great service and at \u20ac80 as cheap as we could find. We did however catch the airport bus back from Sorrento, much cheaper and a very good service.", "title": "superb hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "stephen b b", "date": "June 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133060009}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012", "text": "just returned from having a wonderful time at the gran paradiso. everything about this hotel was fantastic, the views overlooking the bay of naples is truely breathtaking,the room was very comfortable with a large balcony with sea views,the food and restaurant staff was 1st class.
