I have to first start of the review by commenting on the obvious: it's Dayton, OH, - is just not that great of a place to be in the first place. With that said, this hotel was clean, convenient and the staff was friendly. It offers a free shuttle to and from the airport, which was very helpful. In addition, it includes breakfast which is available from 4:00 a.m. This is helpful for anyone with an early morning flight (apparenlty, many of the pilots stay over there). The shuttle starts running at 5:00 a.m.", "title": "Decent For the Price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "shida_girlBoston_MA", "date": "May 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 15817748}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Renovation nightmare!", "text": "FOOD - it is actually very convenient to a number of places to eat -since I didn't have a car, it was helpful to walk right across the way to some decent food.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dawnbart87", "date": "November 7, 2006", "id": 6079601}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "All in all, it was a decent hotel for the price.
