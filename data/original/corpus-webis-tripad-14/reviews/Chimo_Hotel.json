The carpet was filthy, there was a clearly visible layer of dust on all cupboards, drawers, TV. There were even toe nail clippings at the side of the bed. The bath and shower showed the worse for wear - very old worn out bath, leaking showere head and black mildew/bacteria on the tiles. Towels were, although clean, were worn out. So I complained, the receptionist said sorry and gave me keys to view another room - which was in an identical state of filth! The hotel was really buzy - there were 2 functions on and lots of people running around the corridors into the early hours of the morning. When I phoned the receptionist again, she was appologetic but said that ultimately there was not a lot she could do to stop them running around until 2.00am. There is also a club nearby, that has live bands at the weekend, so it is very difficult to get to sleep (should you stay at the weekend) as the building is not soundproof. The only thing nearby is a shopping mall. There is no decent restaurants nearby, and a fair jaunt into the town by foot - so you would really need a car.
