When it did arrive, my \"country\" breakfast (listed on the menu as a full english) came with one poached egg, one sausage, two slim rashers of bacon, one mushroom and one half grilled tomato. We paid the full B&B rate of \u00a3118, but if I had paid the separate \u00a315 breakfast charge I would have been disgusted (I was anyway). We all know breakfasts don't cost that much to cater, and fair enough there was a buffet - but that had run dry when we arrived at 9.50 (breakfast ran till 10.30 - there was little in the way of replenishment). They clearly cannot cope with large amounts of guests - but for a successful and reasonably pricey hotel in a major wedding catchment area I was not impressed at all.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 26, 2004", "id": 2601535}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "I booked this through Lastminute for a bargain \u00a353 for the two of us, including breakfast. What a lovely hotel, bang in the centre of Farnham, within easy walking distance of the many pubs and restaurants. Our room was very traditional, and very comfy with all the amenities you would expect of a 4* hotel. It had a trouser press, free bottled sparkling and still water, herbal teas/normal tea/coffee, and hot chocolate. The breakfast was a treat, in a beautiful room with chandaliers. It's coming up to Christmas and it was tastefully decorated, not tacky. The buffet was plentiful, with yummy treats like fresh figs, fresh honey, and the usual pastries, cheeses, meats etc. Toast came out automatically, and there was waiter service for the hot food. Yes, you got 'one egg' if you ordered the poached, but I'm sure you can order more if need be. My beans on toast came out with 4 tiny triangles of toast with the crusts cut off, arranged around a small pot of beans. I guess the restaurants theme is the appearance of the food rather than the quantity, but the overall quality was fantastic. All in all, we had a very pleasant stay in a good standard 4* hotel for a bargain price. We'll certainly consider going there again next time we want a quick get-away.", "title": "A Pleasant Surprise", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "southmouth", "date": "November 26, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4144278}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful wedding venue", "text": "My daughter and her new husband had their wedding reception here at the end of October.

On the website the hotel looked really lovely however we found it to be pretty shabby and felt that the \u00a3160 B&B rate was certainly not deserved. We waited about 15 minutes to check in which was not great as we were in a rush. Some people's rooms were not even ready and it was mid afternoon. The room was OK but the bathroom was really old and tatty and not particularly clean, we were only given two small hand towels. Breakfas was included in the price, the buffet bit was fine but the cooked food was a real let down with tiny portions, I ordered poached eggs with beans, mushrooms and tomato and literlly got 1 mushroom and half a tomato ( we also had a 40 minute wait for this).

The food was such a let down. We ordered a plowman's lunch from the bar menu at nearly \u00a310 a go and it was just a joke. Tiny amount of dried up cheese and celery. Three mingy (tiny) slices of white dry bread. A teeny tiny pot of pickle. The barman serving us said it was not his problem! Pathetic in such a hotel. We got disturbed by the disco from the wedding in the hotel. We went to bed after midnight but the noise from the rowdy wedding guests and disco up kept us awake. A drunk guest called us in the middle of the night (4am). As requested my medium boiled egg at breakfast arrived watery inside.
