The pool at the Contemporary is only 3 feet, so the boys wouldn't go swimming with the babies and their diapers. While at the Contemporary we took the monorail over to the Grand Floridian Resort and swam in their pool which was great. At night it is a little scary to go to the pool at the Contemporary because our room was so far away and I didn't want the boys to walk by themselves. It was pretty quiet and empty at 11:00 at night. We have rented the boats in the past, but this year you could not rent the boats unless you were with an adult or had a driver license. The policy was changed but nobody told me that when I called. They claim the teenagers were getting into to many accidents. The reason is the motors are bigger than the boats at downtown. So we took a bus to downtown to rent the boats. We rented them for an hour. They were so slow and my son's boat kept stalling out. What a disaster. The last part of our Florida trip was spent at Universal Hard Rock Hotel.

We were treated great the moment we arrived. Our room was wonderful and very up to date. Staff was excellent and helped us in every way. I would say if you stay at the contemporary to stay in the tower. Views of magic kingdom were the best and right from your room balcony.. The pool was great with lots of room and waterslide. They also have a marina and you can parasail or rent a boat. The beds are very comfortable. The contemporary is so close to magic kingdom you can walk. Also lots of transportation to take you to any of the parks. My only complaint wasn't about the hotel it was the huge crowds of wall to wall people all visiting Disneyword just like we were. This was only average season but it was packed. You wait a long time to ride, eat, etc. and the buses and monrails were jam packed. They do offer fast passes for many attractions but you still wait. I can't imagine what peak season is like. They also have extra magic hours for hotel guests but it was still busy. Just think of all the hotels Disney has. You get my point it was busy. The huge crowds and long lines really took away from the fun. Plus it was very hot and we noticed that it was hard on young children waiting for rides between the heat and lines. I do have to say though that Disneyworld is so clean and kept up, they have beautiful grounds. If you go stay at the contemporary. You may not love the crowds but you;ll love the hotel.

Our room was not ready at the time so we made our way to the parks. Upon entering the room, I was surprised at the renovations after seeing photos of the old rooms. However, the amazement did not last long. The room was not overly clean. I do no think the vacuum has been ran since the remodel. When this was mentioned to the staff, I was told that they are short staffed. It should not make a difference. You are paying for a Deluxe resort (expensive) it should be clean, not matter what.....Between the crumbs and broken crayons, lets just say it was quite disgusting. Thank goodness the sheets were clean!!!! Apparently the tub/shower was not replaced during the remodel, because the soap scum is still there. I don't think that much could build up in the couple of months since they started remodeling. However, we tried to make the best of things. When returning to the hotel from EPCOT the monorail to the Hotel and Magic Kingdom was not working. Unfortunately, there is no other way to the hotel. After standing in a line with about 500 other people for buses for about an hour, we were finally told that a bus would be going to the resorts only. After finally arriving back at the resort, we decided we had enough \"Disney\". We went to the desk to check out. It's amazing how friendly the staff can be upon checking in, but rude when checking out with problems. I have never dealt with a Disney employee as rude as my checkout, and I have been to Disney 8 times now and stayed on property every time. I could not recommend the Contemporary Resort to anyone. The only thing it has going for it is the location within walking distance to Magic Kingdom. I would, however, recommend the Animal Kingdom. We stayed there in August, 2005. Yes, the rooms are smaller, but they are clean. I read other reviews before I left, but decided that I would check it out myself, I wish I had listened to them.....Ending on a good note, we left Disney and went to Myrtle Beach and had a great time......better luck next time I guess.", "helpfulness": 22, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 8, 2006", "id": 5043522}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Perfect", "text": "So my wife has been hitting me up to go to Disney ever since our Honeymoon in 2002.

Rooms were Perfect, Plasma TV, Sheets that were comforatable , staff was great, View was even better ...Had my doubts about taking 2 boys that were so young and wont remember anything at all, but I will always remember my son as he saw the monarial pull right into the hotel there on the 4th Floor or holding him on our balcony as the fireworks were going off. This topped the Grand Floridan by a mile ..room was nicer and more of a hotel feel then a big resort feel that the Grand gives off, Arcade was great, Food was great, I will return!!!
