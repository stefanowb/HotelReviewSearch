The staff is very professional and helpful, especially Nancy and Sarah who really made my stay feel as if i had never left home. the only area i was a little disapointed with was the bathrooms just a little small, but then at 6ft 4\" tall when are they not. too many amenities to list but the free laundry was a refreshing change.
