We had never visited Barcelona before and I found this hotel through a review in a travel guide which described the location as 'a quiet street off the Rambla'. In the day it did seem relatively quiet, but in the evening a bar next to the hotel put tables and chairs out on the pavement and this was fairly busy all evening till gone 1am. I had a room overlooking the square and although closing the balcony doors shut out a lot of general daytime noise, I still found the first night (a Saturday) very noisy. We retired early as we had had a very early start and were tired, but the hubbub from next door kept me awake - relief came about 1.30am but the respite was only momentary because some hidden nightclub across the road started playing *really* loud music then until gone 4am! Even with earplugs I could not sleep and complained at the desk that I had requested a quiet room, but was told that the hotel was full and person on duty had no knowledge of reservations. My friend was at the back of the hotel but she had trouble with noise from the drains and the kitchen. We were only there for two nights and presumed (rightly) that Sunday night would be quieter, so we put up with it. On the second day the bathroom door in my room locked itself so I couldn't get in (it was one of those locks in the handle) and upon reporting the fact to reception was given a straightened paper clip by the clerk, who then mimed unpicking the lock!
