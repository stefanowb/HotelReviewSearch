They placed us in SMOKING rooms on a SMOKING floor. The odor in the rooms was very strong. We asked for different rooms, but they stated the hotel was full. We asked about the possibility of being moved to a non-smoking room the next day. They told us no non-smoking rooms were available, nor would any non-smoking rooms be available the next day.

I had done some extensive research on hotels before choosing this one. This hotel had a great price rate, reviews, & photos, so we thought we would give it a shot. We were VERY glad we did! The location of the hotel was very convienient to all the things we had planned to do, such as the Georgia Aquarium, The World of Coca-Cola, the CNN studio tour, & the local malls. We didn't do a whole lot of other venturing out, because the weather wasn't too great & traffic was horrible! One night we stayed in & ate at the restaurant inside the hotel, which was GREAT! The server was very friendly, along with all the hotel staff. We also ordered room service one night & was fast & great as well. Checking in & out was fast & easy. Our room was so cozy & clean. We loved the large flat tv & the complimentary Wifi. We locked our key in the room by accident once, & the guy at the front desk was so nice about giving us another. The only downfall (and it wasnt a huge downfall for us but may be for others) is there was only one pool which was indoors and it was small & so was the fitness center (there were several people using both) & also the parking. Parking was at the top of a steep hill behind the hotel. We were ok with walking, but it might be a problem for someone else. We did however unload our luggage at the front, took it up, & then parked, which worked out great for us.

It is definitely non overweight people, disabled or physically challenged in anyway. I am an obese woman and couldn't do it but if you aren't challenged in any way you will be ok. There are 6 handicap spaces next to the hotel for those who have tags all others are towed away at owners expense; $125 tow and $15 a day storage.
