It\u2019s a very big parking lot, and even at night, you have to search for a spot in the \u201cnorth 40\u201d, and schlep your bags through the cars in the lot. Fortunately, there was this really big grasshopper that appeared in the parking lot to give us a welcomed greeting (he must be on staff). At this point I really wanted to relax in the lounge and enjoy a cold adult beverage. Apparently there were many others with this same idea, but unfortunately, we were told the bar was closed (then why was there a guy relaxing at the bar with two big fresh drinks in front of him?). It seems to me that at this day and age, if you have customers that want to give you money, ...keep the bar open!
