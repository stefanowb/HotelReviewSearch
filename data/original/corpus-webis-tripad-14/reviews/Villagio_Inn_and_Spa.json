We chose Yountville because of its great location and world class food and wine. We chose the Villagio because of a high Trip Advisor score. We booked 2 nights through the hotel where the operator assured us that our room would be quiet, and that by paying more, we would also get a premium view of the hills (about $435 a night). She also directed us to view the website and see the beautiful rooms and vaulted ceilings of the top floor rooms. Imagine our surprise when the bellmen led us to our room on the edge of a major construction site! The view from ALL three sides of our room was of construction! In addition the room was just so \"marginal\" in its look and style. It wasn't romantic, it wasn't hip or cool and it certainly wasn't elegant. In fact it even lacked any good function or flow. We asked to be moved and were told they had no more rooms. I spoke with the manager and he offered to move us the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed that no one told us about construction when we booked the room. And that the picture of the room on the website was not our (get this) newly redecorated room. The bed was marginal, the furnishings were low-end looking although new, and the wall decor was done in an odd way. The feeling is low-end hotel that tries unsuccessfully to do Pottery Barn and fails. The next morning we were woken at 7:30 AM by construction workers hammering. By 7:45 there were numerous large dump trucks with their motors running and skill saws cutting. Don't you just love the sound of a truck backing up outside on the morning of your anniversary? It's just so romantic! I called the manager and complained about the early construction start, the loud noise, and again that we were not informed about construction when we made reservations. He offered us a free nights lodging. We declined and of course we checked out. He adjusted the bill by 50% but keep in mind this room was almost $450 to start. At $225 it was still not worth it, even without construction. Just go across the street to the Yountville Inn to get a better rate and a better room.

They also have a made to order omelette and waffle station.

This was perfect as most restaurants weren't open and our dinner reservation was not until 7:15 PM.

Our room was spacious and clean. The amenities were nice and even included a Nespresso machine. Yum! My only complaint was there was a little bit of road noice from Highway 29 because our room was on the outer courtyard. The spa looked very nice, although we didn't have a chance to use it.

The people were kind and very easy to work with. Honestly, I have nothing bad to say at all. One of the best things is the breakfast. The chef makes a full buffett breakfast which is included in any room you get. Just find the cheapest room and the breakfast is included... even if they say it's not. It;s not just a piece of toast either. It's a full spread with an omlette bar.

Rooms are very nice, though not quite as luxorious as the rest of the resort. There is a lovely pation off each room, and they give you a bottle of wine! A bit dark, but with fireplace. Mattresses was OK, not bad, but not top notch. It is firm, which I like, and I am pretty picky. Sheets are good. Had 2 for 1 treatsment special at the Spa which were wonderful!
