At $750/night, I expect to have my socks blown off by the setting, the staff, the accomodations, the meals, everything. They came close, but \"no cigar\". The little cabins are clean and well-appointed. The bus ride in was 6.5 hours, but it passed very quickly as the driver was a wealth of information about Denali as well as an excellent look-out for wildlife. The setting is outstanding, right by a beautiful stream. A van every evening takes people to Wonder Lake (about 10 minutes down the road) where, if the weather is good, you get a great view of Mt. McKinley. The staff was mixed. About half were friendly, informative, and interested in making sure the guests were taken care of. The other half were friendly enough but clearly just doing a job, marking the hours until they were off. My biggest criticism, however, was the meal service. Think \"bad hotel food\" and you've got the picture. The desserts were straight off the shelf from Costco. I've been to backcountry lodges where the supplies were brought in by mule and the food was much better.", "title": "Expensive, and almost worth it", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "jbullock47", "date": "August 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3759452}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "If you have several days and are willing to take walks up to challenging day hikes, then the Denali Backcountry Lodge is the way to see the park.

Sepnd a few days at the lodge (2 or more depending on your time and willingness to hike). Then take the bus out in the morning or fly and you can catch the train back to Anchorage (8 hours but a kick) or get a bus/van that are quicker but not as interesting.", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 9, 2005", "id": 3749484}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Relaxing", "text": "Do not under any circumstances book this very expensive lodge without travel insurance. I made that mistake and they are merciless. A serious family illness forced us to cancel our Alaskan trip 29 days before it began. Every vendor offered full refunds except this one. I expected to lose my $1500 deposit. But I didn't expect them to bill my credit card another $1500 after I had notified them I couldn't make it. I've never heard of losing more than your deposit?!? Ouch. I have enough to deal with just coping with the family tragedy, but I just get aggravated thinking how this greedy outfit profited from my misforturtune since I'm sure they rebooked these rooms as packed as Alaska is this season.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 21, 2005", "id": 3690776}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "The Denali Backcountry Lodge is a great place.
