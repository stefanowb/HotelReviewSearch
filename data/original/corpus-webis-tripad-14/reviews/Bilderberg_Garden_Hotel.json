As a Dutch-tourism-rated 5 star hotel, we expected a lot, but were told later that the Dutch star ratings are based on price more than services and amenities. It is a nice hotel, but if you are expecting a \"5-star experience\", look elsewhere--it is not posh by any means and is probably a 3 star in all honesty. Additionally, we found the distance a little too far from the city center for our liking. The hotel is nice-enough, but does not really shine in any area nor does it endear itself to its guests.", "title": "Nice hotel in a quiet residential area, far from city center: not for tourists", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Dallas75204", "date": "December 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6442055, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quiet and comfortable", "disliked": "\u2014 Location was too far from both the museum quarter and the city center"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely Hotel in a lovely area", "text": "As we were driven to the front door, we were taken aback by the construction along the entire front of the hotel--it did not look inviting.
