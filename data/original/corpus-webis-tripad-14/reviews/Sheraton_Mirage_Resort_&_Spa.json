The staff & service here are commendable and we praise them all for ALWAYS providing service with a smile! Rooms are tastefully decorated and the bed is EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE and..... it's like sleeping on clouds: so dreamy!!! The recently refurbished hotel looks chic & fabulous and is, in my opinion, probably more appealing now to younger couples, than it was previously, however it's also greatly appreciated by us (& we're in our early 50's).This is one of our top 2 favourite '5 Star' hotels in Australia and we highly recommend this superb resort to everyone!!! Pamper yourself and stay here, sometime! We all DESERVE the BEST in life & this is one of the BEST!!!
