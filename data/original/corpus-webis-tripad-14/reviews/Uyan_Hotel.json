The room (205) we were assigned was the standard Deluxe which was clean and tidy even though there was no satellite reception to the TV. We complained about this and I believe as a token gesture the bell boy was sent to our room to say that they would get a tecnichen up to our room to fix it. As an ex TV engineer I could see that the room was not wired for Satellite and that the bell boy was sent to ''placate the tourists''.
