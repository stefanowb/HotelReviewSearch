The location is stunning and peaceful and we stayed in the smaller room but it was lovely with a huge bath. It was a very relaxed stay with attentive but not in your face owners who made it a pleasure. Breakfast was really quite excellent, with thought gone into the menu. Good selection of DVDs and the honesty bar and snacks in the games room where a nice idea. I think this is definitely on my list of a fabulous B&B's and I would recommend it. There are complimentary brownies in reception which we could not help taking when we came back in of an evening to go with a cup of tea. The location is not too far from Southwold and is worth it if you want to get away from it for a bit. Bedrooms were very tasteful shabby chic just my cup of tea.
