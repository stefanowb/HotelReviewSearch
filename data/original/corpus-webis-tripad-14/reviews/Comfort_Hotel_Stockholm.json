Got sort of an Ikea-style bedroom, with one bed against the window, and a 2nd bunk bed that folds down from the side wall. Very nice change from the usual cookie-cutter hotel room. Room was very clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly. Hotel is near the Central Station (which has the airport express train) and is in a very convenient location. Got a great rate on hotels for one night, and then it jumped up $100 the next night. If I could get the lower rate every time, I'd stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 11, 2003", "id": 1221881}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very good, especially if you're traveling light!", "text": "We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in January 2005.
