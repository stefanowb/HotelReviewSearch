I took several private lessons and a clinic during my stay. The Director of Tennis, Warren Florence, is very professional and extremely knowledgeable about the game of tennis. During the lessons, Warren reviewed the fundamentals of tennis and the different strokes. He took time to explain and demonstrate the different strokes. After the first lesson, I felt more confident on the court. He provided me with some great pointers, and I look forward to using them on the court! I highly recommend staying at the Inn at Palmetto Bluff and taking advantage of the wonderful tennis facility. I promise you will not be disappointed!", "user": "sencire", "date": "February 13, 2007", "id": 6784707}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "This Place is Wonderful", "text": "What a wonderful resort! The setting is idyllic, the cuisine is fabulous and the staff at the resort could not be nicer. We felt like we were inside a Norman Rockwell painting of a quaint village, enjoying life how it should be enjoyed. Everything is new, the grounds were perfect, nature was all around us and there is so much to do, we could not do it all. Their spa and golf course were in incredible shape. They even gave us each the use of a fishing pole and tackle and the use of two bicycles during our stay so that we could be young again. We even took their complimentary boat ride over to Hilton Head Island for the day, one day. We had a ball and definitely will be back. I hestitated to write this review because I did not want too many people to know about this very special place. It truly is a wonderful and peaceful. Next time, we may bring the family to enjoy this place, since it looks like a perfect place for a family too.", "user": "Beenaroundtheblock", "date": "January 30, 2007", "id": 6715844}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Spectacular Palmetto Bluff", "text": "Our stay at The Palmetto Bluff Resort was arranged as a businees gathering.

It is absolutely a fresh new take on low-country style and hospitality.

Our brand new \"Village Home\" was also adorable...clean and very comfortable with cozy beds, beautiful linens, comfortable pillows, a stocked frig as well as 4 flat screened TV's. If there is anything to complain about in regards to this home, it is the fact there are NO screens on the windows or doors, so you can not open them. Imagine having beautiful weather right outside your door and you can't enjoy it! A crime! And, as with all new construction, our house was not particularly soundproof, so once one person was up in the morning, we were all up.
