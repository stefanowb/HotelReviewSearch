To begin we were thrilled with double king beds -unheard of in the hotel industry. Gorgeous contemporary boutique style hotel - staff is friendly and helpful.

Although we never stayed there, our impression of the Avia was very slick, modern and trendy. The Andaz is going for a more rustic, barn, vineyard feel.

The suite we booked was huge, with tasteful decor, a huge bathroom, an in room soaking tub and fireplace, all equipping us to relax in style. The minibar offerings were free (except alcohol, understandably), the restaurant's food was amazing, and the hotel's service delivered with a smile. The location was central, right near the many restaurants and shops and not too far from the Oxbow Market. There were a few minor drawbacks... The restaurant service was a little slow, the gym and parking are next door or a block away rather than in the building.

The hotel itself is beautiful -- the lobby and rooms are very nice, and the decor is great. However, there were a few issues that I wouldn't have expected given the price and caliber of the hotel. This could have been due to the opening weekend, but the front desk was fairly unorganized during our stay. It took much longer than they originally told us for our room to be ready, and at times the front desk was totally unmanned. The pool / fitness center adjacent to the hotel is also pretty low quality. And when we woke up in the morning we found an old, dirty used pencil underneath the sheets that seemed like it was from the last person to stay in the room. Not sure if this meant that they didn't fully change the sheets / blankets when cleaning the room. I'm usually not too picky about hotels, but wouldn't have expected this from Andaz.", "user": "AALSF", "date": "December 2, 2012", "id": 146647793}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Ultimate in customer service, great location.", "text": "The Andaz Napa is the ultimate in customer service!
