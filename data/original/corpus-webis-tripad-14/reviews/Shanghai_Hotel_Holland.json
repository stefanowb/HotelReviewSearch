It seems that the hotel has changed ownership (previously called China Holland). Most probably that is the reason that it had been receiving negative reviews which are not alongside my excellent experience. I was upgraded to a \"suite\" in the top-floor but also the \"standard\" rooms are nice. My room was ~50 sq.m. with a Kind size bed, TFT TV, bath-robe & slippers, a large coutch and working area/desk with free Internet. A kettler was available for coffee/tea. The bathtub was literally huge... above the regular full-size in length and width, with an extra bench... which can be used to place your laptop and watch some movies while soaking. The facade was practically a huge window, so that the room was flooding with light. Check my panoramic picture for the view I was enjoying... not picturesque, but still a nice, not restricted view. Delpht city center is 5mins drive and for that outstanding value for money, I will definetely select it again in my next visit.", "title": "Excellent stay in all aspects", "user": "Enoikos", "date": "May 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130589456}], "location": {"country": "The Netherlands", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Delft"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 5, "very good": 8, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 2}, "aka": "China Hotel Delft", "slim_ranking": 0.777777777778, "description": "Shanghai Hotel Holland has reopened her doors with a brand new restaurant.
