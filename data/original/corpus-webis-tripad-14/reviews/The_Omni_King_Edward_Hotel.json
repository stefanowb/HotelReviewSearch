First I usually do not review my business travel accommodations - but I am making an exception. The location of the King Edward is at the outer east end of the Theater District and Financial District. I think it is outside these areas. Airport shuttles do not stop here as it is out f the way and a smaller property. There is considerable construction right next to the hotel and from early morning I was disturbed to early evening. Room furnishings are acceptable, but the room I had (and the others I saw) are basically a refurbishment. My Superior King had a separate bathtub and sink (the tub was at least 20-30 years old and smallish. The toilet and vanity were in a separate room. For one person this means running back and forth but would have plus for a couple. Room size was very good, lots of space in the bedroom. King bed was good, pillows were all feather, down mix, even though my Starwood profile requests synthetic (due to allergies). Floor in room uneven, carpet bucked all over. Single pain glazing so you hear everything outside. The rooms themselves are nothing better than 3*. The lobby and food/bar areas are very nice and well maintained. There is a very small business centre. Amenities are few. The hotel rates itself as a 5* and I have stayed at a great many and this place is lacking the services, amenities and outstanding staff one would find in a 5 star property. An example is how front desk handled my complaints about a wild party down the hall that continued until 3 am...with cases of booze being brought in and people arriving that were not guests of the hotel. The noise was unbearable. 2 calls later nothing was stopping the party scene. At 5 am I was now a zombie...so showered and went out for a walk and breakfast. You would think they would have dealt with it or moved me and some other guests but nope. Sound like a 5 Star hotel to you??. On my last day I had the breakfast special which was very enjoyable, eggs, bacon, coffee, juice and toast - tax and tip for $25 per person. I also attended a hosted event and the ood was very good. The waiters in the restaurant and bars were outstanding and made up for what is lacking in the quality of the rooms, however some of the front desk staff could barely speak English while the Concierge provided \"constrained\" service that was not friendly. Often they and the doorman were clustered on the street front chatting with the desk left unattended. I would not stay at the King Edward again unless it was the deal of the day. For the price I paid I could hve stayed at a truly solid 4 or 5 Star property.", "title": "Look Elewhere", "user": "CanadianBoys", "date": "October 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 20623171}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I just came back from an actuarial conference there.
