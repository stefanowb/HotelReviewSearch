I was a bit surprised to find the family rooms on the top floor (expected them on the ground floor for some reason) but the suite was comfortable and thoughtfully arranged. Our 14 year old daughter was delighted with her room and the claw foot bath in the bathroom. Our room was very spacious with a sea view which was unexpected. The breakfast on the Monday morning was delicious although it lost a little of the personal touch when we had to serve ourselves tea and coffee from the pots on the sideboard, along with jam etc. from large dishes rather than individual pots on the tables.

On arrival we were shown to our room (Room 1) which is on the ground floor. It was a spacious double, overlooking the well-kept gardens. It had modern furniture, LCD/DVD combo and tea and coffee making facilities. The en-suite bathroom was huge with a modern shower enclosure and electric shower. It could easily have accommodated a bath which would have been welcome. For me, the bed could have benefited from being deeper and firmer. The odd thing about the room was that one could hear the sound of the occupants in the room above. Nothing major, but on our last night the occupant above was snoring quite loudly! At breakfast one helped oneself to fruit juice, a choice of cereals, fresh fruit (Strawberries and Melon), together with filter coffee and a choice of teas, whilst awaiting the excellent cooked breakfast with locally sourced produce. The hotel is well placed for a short stroll into picturesque Bull Bay (one pub, a tearoom, and a few houses) or a shor drive into Cemaes Bay with a choice of pubs/eateries, a picturesque harbour and a lovely beach. For walkers there are a number of circular walks nearby and the hotel has drying facilities and storage facilities for bikes. The owners are extremely pleasant and helpful.
