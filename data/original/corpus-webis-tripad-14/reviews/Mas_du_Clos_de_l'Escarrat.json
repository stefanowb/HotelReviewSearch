But it was the best part of the trip. We were with a wonderful group, met some great vintners, and should have bought even more wine. (As it was we came home with nearly four cases -- we even declared it but didn't get stopped at customs) The wine is excellent and cheap by US standards, even if you get stuck paying for shipping and customs. Plus, the vintages soon to be released will be great in Chateauneuf and surrounding areas. The lunch and dinner that Andree presented was worth the cost alone.
