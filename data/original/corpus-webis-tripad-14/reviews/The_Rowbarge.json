It was perfect ................. walkable distance to the St. John's town center, quiet and comfortable rooms and breakfast in the morning ...... oh and a pub to boot. The bed was seriously comfortable, and it was truly quiet an night. I was a bit nervous with the pub next door, and a kid's playground outside our window that the hotel would be noisy .... but it wasn't at all. The staff were friendly and helpful. When our flight arrived at 6:00am in the morning, we thought that we would have to check our bags and come back to the hotel after 3:00 to gain access to our room. But the staff accommodated us when we arrived at 7:00am, which we desperately needed to catch up on sleep from our red-eye flight. And when we need to print out boarding passes on our last day for our return flight home, they graciously allowed us to print from their office computer. And the breakfast was an added bonus. Though I believe that we paid for the breakfast upon settling our bill checking out, it was still a bonus as it was rather convenient to have breakfast available upon waking.", "title": "bed and pub", "user": "bbjj0827", "date": "October 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143000054}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 3, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 0.8125}
