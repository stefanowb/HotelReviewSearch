The hotel is currently under renovation which is needed because the rooms are very old already. The service of the hotel is very good. We had requested the housekeeping things e.g. bottled waters, newspapers, utensils, etc. and they acted very fast to our requests. The location of the hotel is both good and bad. It is connected to a big mall so you can go shopping right away. There are also many good restaurants nearby e.g. Chuk Yuen, Macau restaurant, Ippudo Ramen and two food courts in Silvercord Mall across the hotel and another one inside the big mall beside City Super supermarket. Overall if not for the location of the MTR which I feel is just too far, I will stay in this hotel again even if the hotel has not finished renovating yet..", "title": "OLD HOTEL but GOOD SERVICE", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "winston a", "date": "December 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 122252953}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The location is superb, minutes from MTR, star ferry and within the large Harbour shopping mall. Great places nearby to eat also. Hotel is good, they were doing some maintenance on it when we were there (nov 2011) so was a bit noisy at times but never before 9 Am or in evenings, and this was announced on their home page. We had a Continental club room which we'd recommend as in the lounge you can then get complimentary drinks, good snacks & food, and wifi. Only downside is you cannot open windows, as in many high rises, and no wifi in room.

This hotel is very ideal for first time visitors as it is conveniently located within Harbour City (one big mall) along Canton Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. This hotel is in the middle of two other Marco Polo Hotels; The Marco Polo Hong Kong (closer to the Star Ferry but more expensive) and Marco Polo Prince (similar price range to the Gateway but located at the other end of Harbour City. All the high end stores can be located here and close to the public bus terminal, MTR and Star Ferry. The weather was cold which is just the way we wanted. But i would avoid going to Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year if you plan to go to Disneyland, Ocean Park or other attractions as there are so many people and you will just waste your time lining up for the rides/shows. The newly renovated room was spacious with two double beds but no view though. There are a lot of elevators but does not provide key access for that added level of security and you still have to use a real key to access the rooms (this should have been part of their renovation works). This hotel is a bit expensive but worth it as you are within walking distance to almost everything. The continental club lounge provides an extra level of convenience/privacy. There is free wifi as well as computer terminals. Their breakfast buffet is just as similar as the buffet in their restaurant at the basement. Plus, you can avail of drinks all day and they offer finger foods in the afternoon.", "user": "Solotraveller888", "date": "January 21, 2012", "id": 123398995}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good value for money", "text": "For those who want convenience and do not mind paying a little more, you will definitely not go wrong with this hotel.

The service was impeccable, the staff were very friendly and helpful and treated us like royalty. The rooms were clean and spacious. The buffet breakfast was delicious and plentiful and of a high quality. The Continental Club also offered afternoon tea from 2.30-5.00pm and the food again was delicious and plentiful and I always made sure we were back at the hotel for this special treat that I definitely did not want to miss out on. They also served supper from ?5.30 till 8pm not exactly sure about those times, but again unreal food and plentiful. We hardly ate out at all because the food they served was always enough to fill us up. It was finger food but had variety and enough different dishes to satisfy. Even our fussy daughters were willing to try foods they have never eaten before because they looked so good. The hotel was also close to shops and the harbour if you want to go and see the nightly light show.
