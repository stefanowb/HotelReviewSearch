The room was nice, spacious and clean and the staff very friendly. The main thing about this hotel in our opinion is the location and the bars/restaurants downstairs. Duke's is a fantastic bar with a great atmosphere, great cocktails and you must try the Beach Fries. The food is also great and offers you the choice of eating in the bar or in the restaurant - although best to make reservations if you dont like waiting. We also sampled Chuck's Steakhouse which was also fantastic. We loved the hotel because of the closeness to the beach.

Next time i would probably go with the ocean front instead of the delux, i only used the jacuzzi tub once but it was great! But i would still get just the ocean front cuz the tub took away from space in the room, but other than that the room was clean, we had no problems with noise, it was great cuz on some nights we could hear the shows going on next door at the Royal Hawaiian but only if we opend the lanai doors. The service was wonderful, for exampl on one night we didnt know where to have dinner and hubby was feeling mexican, we just walked down to the concierge and she suggested a great out of the way mexican restaurant i think it was called CHa Cha Cha's we sat outside and it wasnt even crowded, the portions were huge too! We also used the service to rent a car, they even came to get us. The beach in front of the hotel was pretty crowded but we managed to find a spot, the area to the left is where you can arrange for a whole bunch of water sports, which we never go to do, but from what i could see, we had the best hotel on the beach, i really loved it, i thougth it was convenient and it served its purpose, also right in front is the famous Nahoku II which is a catemaran another thing we never got to do, hopefully next time! But i would definately suggest this hotel, it was clean and convenient to ALL, great views, great service, had Dukes Canoe Club right downstairs which is supposed to be a happenin bar but, there was nothing happenin when we were there, it was very slow.

The International Market is right across the street along with Macy's a whole bunch of designer stores and a lot of other stores. Lots of Restaurant too! You don't need a car but we did rent one. We used it almost everydate. Parking is expensive $18/day. The hotel staff is very friendly and always willing to help. My only negative comment would be the noise you can hear outside of your room. They need doors that are soundproof. Other reviews had indicated noise heard from the walls but that's not what I experienced. Couldn't hear anyone from the adjoining rooms. Only heard noise from the hallway. Room was fine. We were four in total and were fine with just one room. The room had two double beds and a pullout sofa. Our City view room had a partial view of the ocean. I wouldn't pay for ocean view. If that's what you want just go to the deck or the beach. Note: if you can get a room from the 14th floor and above it's the way to go. Floors 14 and above have a separate elevator.

Plan to do lots of walking as there is lots to see, but if you want to drive let me suggest going online with Thrifty car rental as they have convertibles to giant Jeep SUVs at great prices. They are only two blocks away and let you drop off as late as 9pm! Rates are amazing and you can rent online an hour or two before and go pickup! We rented 4 times in 12 days!
