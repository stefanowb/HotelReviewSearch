The staff was pleasant, helpful and efficient. The attached restaurant served good food at very reasonable prices! The common areas were small but clean and well appointed. This hotel gets an A+ for cleanliness! They should definitely be giving their hotel workers who clean for them a raise! Our room and especially the bathroom just shined! It was in easy walking distance to their downtown area with restaurants and shops. The only drawback to this hotel was no elevator to the 2nd floor, we had to lug our heavy luggage up to the room on the 2nd floor. For those that would not be able to do that, they do have rooms on the ground floor.

If anyone has read any of my other reviews, you will know that I planned our trip using CAA Triptik that rates the hotels and provides a description. Then I went to Tripadvisor and read many of the reviews which I found to be informative and sometimes entertaining. Anyway, we were not disappointed and were very impressed with the hotel and cleanliness. We only stayed the one night, and foud it to be quite allthough I think they had a full house. We had a long day travelling to Antigonish, so we decided to eat at their restaurant and everyone in my family was very happy with the food and service. My son was happy with the wireless internet service. I disagree with one of the reviews calling this a motel. I think a motel is where you park your car in front of your room. The building was a two story building and we were on the second floor, so perhaps the rooms had direct access to outside. I have to say I did not notice. On that note, there is no elevator, so if you think you can't manage the stairs you may want to ask for the first floor. The front office staff were more than happy to help get our luggage up or down the stairs.
