The super convenient parking garage is situated a few feet from the front desk. Check-in is very fast and professional. This hotel is also attached to the Orlando convention Center and also offers great conference facilities. The rooms are very large with great bedding, a fantastic flat-screen TV, and upscale bath amenities. We also love the pool for its lazy river and the zero-entry swimming area. The executive golf course is also enjoyable. We have dined at all of the dining venues offered by the Hilton. The sports bar is great as well as the coffee shop and pool-side bar. The surprise for my family was how good their steak and chop house is. Spencer\u2019s is located off the main lobby for dinner. We dined here this past Saturday and the food and service were astronomical. We enjoyed excellent salads, dry-aged beef and lamb, and desserts. The price was about $160 for two but it was worth it!
