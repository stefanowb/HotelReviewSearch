Consequently, I waited for 45 minutes at the airport to sort this out. Pretty bad start after a long journey. The Royal Club reception is somewhat run down and check in was fine, although I was charged a hefty fee for 'checking in early' (Given that I didn't stay for 24 hours, I found this rather awkward) But, they played on the fact that you're tired and want to go to bed and cashed in. Room is fine, bathroom ok-ish. I was told that soft drinks were free. Had a soft drink in the pool, but upon check out I was told 'that I took the drink in the wrong pool' and was charged for it. If only they had been clearer about what is the right pool and if only if their staff had instructions about not being petty about a soft drink....it was annoying. I can afford a soft drink, but it was the principle of it and they played by unclear rules. The gym of the hotel was fantastic and made my day. All in all, not a place to go back to.

Make sure you chekc that it is the Le Meridien closest to the airport. There are a few of them in Dubai. I booked both times the Royal Business Lounge. It is a little more out of the pocket but very worth it. Speakers in the shower with glass walls so you can watch the TV in the bedroom while you shower. With the Royal Business Lounge you are provided with a separate check in where you are provided with what every you wish, fruit wine, beer , juice anything. You can even give them your CC and head to your room where they will bring your paperwork back to you in minutes while you start to relax. There are 6 or 7 restaurants in back, The Meridien Villiage, along with a night club....I wouldn't suggest you bring your girlfriend or wife there !o) Through the Royal reservations you are provided with different taxis, Lexus and very nice. They make you feel like a king and Queen. The Airport is around the block and you'd be amazed at the silence.

Although my organization paid, I would stay there again if I were paying out of my pocket. The room was very comfortable, almost opulent, and the staff were competent and accommodating. My only criticism is that if you don't want to pay the high price fixe for breakfast in the restaurant and would rather go a la carte, they escort you across the hall to a place that they have cordoned off in what looks like a bar with a temporary room divider. This is where you have breakfast if you don't want to pay the $20 or whatever it is for breakfast in the restaurant. It feels a bit cobbled together and segregated.
