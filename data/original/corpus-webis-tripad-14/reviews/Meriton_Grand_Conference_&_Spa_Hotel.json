From the previous time the difference was that the price had gone up by 50% and that didn't even cover all... Small things like bathrobes - you had to pay more! Last year everything was great - price reasonable, room with great view on the old town fortress, nice experience in spa etc. This year things were so different - while asking for a room here for the new year time, they gave us several prices - 150 eur, 135 eur, finally around 100 eur/room through a local friend. The pricing through e-mail enquiry was higher than in their website! When phoned, they said that the party packs that are advertised in their website were only for Russians!! That price was less than 70 eur!! This is unbelievable, as we were not in Russia, but in Estonia! Also spa packs were not available, although their website doesn't mention anything about the non-available times. First we got a room in the old side (\"first part\"), the room was old and tables were not wiped well. The next night we changed to the new side, with much nicer room interior (but also there was something wrong - the light system was strange, you couldn't use the night lights easily). The old part is definitely not four star, so when booking, immediately ask for the new part room, to avoid paying a lot for poor room!!", "title": "Discriminating, multi-pricing hotel!! just an average experience!", "user": "Seikkailija555", "date": "January 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 91485132}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "Spa was just ok, they had changed infrared sauna to a stupid mild sauna, salt and steam sauna is nice.
