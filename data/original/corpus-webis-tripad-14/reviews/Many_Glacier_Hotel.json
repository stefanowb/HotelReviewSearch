One of the other guests described it as having a charm similar to that of the old wooden rollercoasters. It's not a luxury resort, but it is on a beautiful lake with access to several walking paths and a couple of long hikes which take you to some spectacular scenery and very near a glacier. The rooms are spartan, but clean and reasonably comfortable.

We had researched this hotel on Tripadvisor and knew what to expect in terms of its age, the type of room we were likely get, services, etc. (no TV, college age servers, noisy) The location of this hotel can't be beat, the view from the porch is unparalleled and to stay there is overall, a very special experience. One of the highlights of our trip was meeting a wildlife videographer while sitting by the fire in the lobby - he had experienced a bear encounter that day resulting in the closure of the Swiftcurrent Trail and this was fascinating. On the flip side, if you take the time to look at the old photographs lining the hallways, you can see that the MG is currently an inappropriately \"updated\" version of its old, authentic self - there are dropped ceilings and drywall covering beautiful old wood and huge beams, things are inappropriately painted and look cheesy, the lobby has a built out gift store that is terribly inappropriate in terms of maintaining an authentic ambiance, the big stone fireplace on the side of the main floor lobby (not the center one that everyone sits around) is actually blocked by trash cans and recycling bins - what?? and many other details that, when taken together, really cheapen the whole national park lodge feeling that could be possible there. Also, the hotel makes absolutely no use of its downstairs level (which also has a big beautiful fireplace), nor the outside area right next to the lake - there is literally nothing there and is completely wasted as a cool place where people would probably love to sit and look at the lake. Clearly, there is a lot of wasted potential there that someone with some money and vision could do a lot with in terms of making this place spectacular. On the whole, the place is a little bit sad, but we enjoyed our time there so we would definitely go back and stay.", "title": "Many Glacier Hotel - perfect location, needs renovation back to old days", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "witgirlDetroit", "date": "October 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 46289023}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is one of the classic national park beauties.

Before staying here you need to understand it is an older hotel, rooms are small, things are not fancy and there are no TVs - you are in a National Park!

One thing for sure - steer clear of the coffee in the little self-service store...we all were heating it up in the microwave in order to have decent coffee!! Everything else was very nice though.

We cut the heat on as high as it would go and it took hours to warm up to an acceptable temperature which was probably 65 degrees or so. The airlines had lost our luggage which became even more painful because we didn't have too many options for adding layers of clothing to keep us warm. Because of our luggage situation (it was delivered the next morning, which was the day we were checking out), we had asked for a late check-out to give us time to shower, change clothes, etc after our luggage arrived and were told it was not possible.
