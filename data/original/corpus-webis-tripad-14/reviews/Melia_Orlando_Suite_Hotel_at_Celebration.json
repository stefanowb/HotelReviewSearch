This was our first time @ Melia. We were there for a three nights. It was myself, husband, son, daughter-in-law & grandchildren ages 6,3 & infant. We had a 2 bedroom /2 bath family suite, which has 2 double beds in one bedroom, a king size bed in the other bedroom with an attached bath, sofa bed in the living room. It had a kitchen with a full size fridge, microwave & dishwasher. We were on the 5th floor corner suite so it had 2 balconies. The master bedroom balcony was large with a table & 4 chairs & lounge sofa. Everything was clean in the suite. Amenities like shampoo, gel, conditioner were given daily. soap very small bars. The air conditioner handler was in the dining/ living room area was quite noisy, the bedrooms were very warm while you were sleeping. I told the front desk person, Kenneth that ceiling fans were needed for the bedrooms. I found the staff to be very friendly & helpful. We checked in about 9pm & Thomas was very helpful in bringing the luggage, getting the pack-n-play & ice for our suite. I wanted pool view which this suite was not. Kenneth said upon checking in that he would need management to approve this but having the three children I did not want any delay as it was already past their bedtime. As previous reviews stated the breakfast was ok, could be better. But for us it was fine. They had cereal, bagels, pastries , bananas, oranges, apples, urns of fresh delicious coffee, hot water for teas or hot chocolate, orange & cranberry juices, & milk. Waiters were always clearing the tables. I like having continental breakfast especially with the kids. We had dinner @ the restaurant for Mother's Day eve.The service, Jay, & food were very good. Portions were large for a hotel restaurant. The The lobby & the grounds were well kept & clean.,", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "mssee", "date": "May 14, 2013", "id": 160747711}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "pool area was very nice & the water felt warm.
