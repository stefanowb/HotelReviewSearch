Placed between a beautiful city park and a small beautiful beach we found it to be a perfect location. If you need to be in the center of all the \"action\" this definitely wouldn't be the hotel for you however if you enjoy a 15 minute walk to breakfast or a stroll at night back to your room this is perfect. The free bikes also made a great impression being able to check out the local neighborhood first hand instead out of a car window. The complimentary coffee and evening wine was also a very nice touch.", "title": "Quiet Escape on Waikiki", "user": "BFMCharlotte", "date": "October 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144178501}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled solo", "text": "If you like to be away from the hustle and close to a residential experience. Aqua Lotus is excellent. The staff is very helpful and friendly There is an excellent beach 100 yards from the hotel where locals and tourists swim.. There is complimentary coffee in the morning and wine in the afternoon, however the hotel does not have a restaurant and that is the only deficit that reduces the star rating. If they just had a croissant and scone in the AM and some fruit in the PM would help. There is a restaurant next door in the New Otani. I prefer the ambiance of a laid back hotel because the guests tend to be laid back. It is a 15 min beautiful walk along the waterfront to Waikiki shopping . The feeling is one of relationship building between hotel and guests, that is hard to do in a commercial center like Honolulu. The Aqua Lotus is committed to service, value and hospitality. Try Tokkuri Tei sushi reasonably close by and Diamond Head Grill for breakfast scones.", "title": "Friendly simple modern relaxed gem", "user": "VeniVidiVici2", "date": "October 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144077990}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our stay at the Aqua Lotus was great.

Plenty of space, and the shelving for the towels and the basket for the used towels was a nice touch. Felt more like an inviting guest bath rather than a standard hotel bathroom. As many others have stated, the location is peaceful and quiet compared to the rest of Waikiki, and the view of Diamond head with the sun rising behind it in the morning is beautiful!

However, the room was small and fairly basic. The bed was very comfortable though. You're basically paying for the location. Only one elevator for the whole hotel.
