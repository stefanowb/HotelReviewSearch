The room was perfectly clean, beds luxiourous. The facilities for the conference were perfect. We used the pool one day, it was wonderful.

I felt that the room was 'okay' perhaps since I booked on Priceline that maybe I got a room that had a few minor issues that I'm not going to really even mention. They do have valet ($25/day) and self parking ($20/day) but there is plenty of on street parking that is pretty safe, but I would always use common sense. I signed up to be a Hyatt Gold Passport member which I would recommend if you end up getting this room through a site like Priceline/Hotwire. Perks like late check out at 2pm. Also, the pool looked nice but didn't use it.
