We were very happy with this hotel based on the location, nice rooms and cheap rates. It isn't all perfect though. I stayed in room 201 and it is very noisy with the stairwell right behind the bed. I would suggest that any room ending in 01 will be near the stairs and should be avoided unless you want to wear earplugs while you sleep (yuck). Also, the shower in my room didn't have too much pressure, however, this was not the case in two of the other rooms my friends stayed in which had a good deal of pressure (go figure). All in all, it was a nice clean hotel with comfortable rooms that aren't shoddy at all. The rate was fantastic as well. The wi-fi for the internet isn't so great.

After reading all the horrible reviews on the first place we had booked, we decided to change our reservations to the Montreal Espace Confort. I am sooo happy that we did. The rooms are impeccably clean and decorated in a tasteful modern style. They are not huge, but there are so many places to put your travel stuff that we never felt cramped. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful and accomodating. The location is perfect- in the heart of where you want to be with tons of restaurants and bars near by, and walking distance to everything else. The air conditioner was a godsend. This was an amazing value for the money. I am REALLY happy we stayed there and would reccommend it to anyone else!
