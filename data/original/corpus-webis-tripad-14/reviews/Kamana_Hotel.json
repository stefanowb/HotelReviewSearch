Very safe and secure with 24hr security guard. Rooms are basic but have hot showers and tv and are of a decent size. In room safe facilities also available as well as internet access and snack bar in the lobby - handy for travellers arriving and departing at unsociable hours form Lima airport! Staff are friendly and very helpful and can arrange reasonably priced transfers to and from the airport (generally much cheaper than those offered by your tour operator) as well as to neighbouring areas such as Miraflores. Can be bit cold in winter, but extra blankets etc available if you ask the friendly reception.
