The staff were all friendly and accomodating, the pool and the workout room just lovely. The grand opening rate was okay and when booked directly with the hotel, they also threw in some comps.

Our rooms had a small balcony with a \"partially obstructed\", but beautiful view of the Sant Monica Beach and Pacific Ocean. These rooms overlooked the pool and were on the south side of the buliding on the 3rd floor. At this time of year there is no sun on these balconies. If you are a sunworshipper or enjoy watching the sun rise and set, we would recommend getting a south facing room (the ones overlooking the pool) on the 3rd or 4th floors or a \"Premier Ocean Front\" room. There are many different types of rooms with varying views, prices and bed configurations. It would be prudent to clarify these details at the time of booking to avoid confusion. One other note, although the rooms are well soundproofed, the premier ocean front rooms at the front of the hotel, may be a bit noisier than the ones set further back, especially when sitting out on the balcony, because of the traffic. All in all the rooms were very clean, the beds and linens were fresh and comfortable and the maid service was efficient and friendly. We loved the rain shower and did not have any problems with water temperature or pressure. There was an empty fridge in our rooms which was extremely convenient and we enjoyed having free wifi in our room. Our sons enjoyed the pool and hot tub and took advantage of the fitness facility in the hotel. The location of this hotel is fantastic as it is a short walk to the pier,all of the best restaurants, sites, beaches, bike paths, rentals and jogging trails. The fact that there was no restaurant in the hotel was not a big deal as it forced us to explore the area and experience different restaurants. Although this hotel is one of the pricier hotels in the area, it was immaculately clean, safe and well situated. Perhaps the best part of this hotel was the welcoming staff. Stevie, Cash, Kimberley and our booking assistant Lynette, were extremley friendly, accomodating and patient with all of our queries and questions. They really made us feel at home. The valet staff and doormen James and Randell always greeted us with a smile. All in all we had a wonderful time at this hotel, the weather was fantastic and we didnt want to leave. We can't wait to return.
