We had 21 guests, and every one of them, including ourselves, were BEYOND impressed with this resort. From the time we arrived we were welcomed by friendly, welcoming staff, and that service continued throughout the week. We were beyond impressed with the service, esp. Antonio, our favorite server! By the end of the week,, he felt more like a part our group than a waiter we had just met. If I had to pick the 'best' thing about the resort, it would be the staff, as they go above and beyond to make your trip unforgettable. I had never been to Mexico or to an all-inclusive, so I was unsure what to expect. After this trip, I am afraid to try a different resort in fear of disappointment! The quality of the food and drinks was superb, and we enjoyed every single meal. I have a seafood allergy, and our chef and servers at Himitsu were very accommodating - very impressed with this careful attention. Portofino was also amazing, and Oceana was our favorite spot for lunch. As part of our wedding package, we enjoyed a private romantic dinner on the beach, and this was the best meal I have ever had (again, they adjusted my menu due to my seafood allergy). Prior to our arrival, I emailed the wedding staff via email, and although at times they were a bit slow in responding, I completely understood why once we arrived and met with Lorena, our coordinator. They are turning out multiple weddings EVERY day, and each was unique and beautiful. We essentially planned an entire wedding in about 20 minutes, 3 days before, and everything was exactly how I could have pictured it! Our private reception in the Wine Cellar was beyond my expectations! I would highly recommend this resort to anyone considering a destination wedding! We stayed in a preferred club, ocean view room, and I highly recommend the preferred club, as you have access to the private lounge, free wi-fi codes, and upgraded mini-bar. Our view was picture perfect, and we enjoyed the jacuzzi on the balcony as opposed to a plunge pool, which we also considered when we planned our trip. The spa is amazing, and our couples' massage was the best we've ever had.

The resort grounds are gorgeous and extremely well-kept and clean. Our bellboy, Antonio, was professional and very welcoming. He gave us a complete tour of our room - which we received earlier than we had anticipated. It is open concept. We had a premium deluxe room with a plunge pool on the balcony - absolutely worth it for us. The kids had a great time in there! Food was excellent in all of the restaurants. The French restaurant was no exception - just be aware that it is the only restaurant where children under 12 are not allowed. Not a problem, there is a kids' club of course. The beach was beautiful, although the hurricane that had passed through the week before did stir up some jellyfish to shore.
