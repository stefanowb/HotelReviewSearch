To say I was comfortable at this hotel is putting it midly. I big proponent of new. And this place is only abt a year old. This hotel has completely shifted my thoughts on what nice is. The lighting, the city views, the touch pad operation of all things in the room, completely blew me away. And to say I fell in love with the \"good night\" button is putting it midly. I was huge fan of this place. Not to mention all that it has to offer from a restaurant perspective. I never had a need to leave the hotel at all. The only minor quirk that I had abt the hotel was the fact that they didn't have any outlet plugs close to the bed (for those of you who prefer working in bed versus the desk). Other that, I completely loved my stay. I will say that the check-in and check out lines were a complete mess, but I enjoyed my stay in the room so much that I completely overlooked the madness. I've sung the Aria's praises all week. It was quite dreadful when I had to stay at another Vegas hotel the next week due to a convention. Needless to say it paled it comparisons.

The check in area is huge and stunning. The people at the counter were accomadating and efficient. Before we were able to get onto the elevator we had to show our room card to a security gaurd standing in the hall before the elevators. I thought that was great. When we got into our room we were extrememly pleased on the modern upscale decor. Flat panel T.V. that allowed you to control everything in the room from the temperature to the opening of the curtains. Our view of the Manderan hotel and the strip was awesome. The washroom was just the right size with a double sink and a great shower. The best part of the room was the amazing bed!! Once you lied down it was hard to get out of it. 24hrs. room service was fast and delicious. The Skybox Restaurant is good for a quick bite and a beer. I highly recommend the Prime Rib burger!! The Casino seemed small compared to other hotels, but was nice and there were alot of $10 tables throughout the day and night. The location of the Hotel was great. It is located between the Monte Carlo and The Cosmopolitan. Friends of ours stayed at the Bellagio and the walk was about 10 mins.(they thought our hotel was much better) One other thing, which may be important to some but not others, was the wat the Aria pumped in a Vanilla type smell, it didn't smell like an ashtray which some others do.

My situation is I was offered 3 nights comped to us for a previous visit of very minimal casino play, a welcomed opportunity. The 200.00 casino play is much to do about nothing. You have to use your money to get the slot working with the free play and it is difficult to keep up with the play during the process and at the end, won nothing plus the money I put in I lost. Study the instructions before you do it. Second the 50. food credit was certainly required. Minimal dinner (small steak and she had a pasta dish) in the cafe was $80.00 but less the 50. credit now its down to market value. 1 coffee, 1 OJ and 2 yogurt parfaits were 26.00 for breakfast. Ouch. On the other hand the buffet was close to 40 a person but hey it was WORTH it and the best! Lobster, crab and everything imaginable. Fantastic.

Also healthy choices are available--good egg white fritatta, oatmeal, fresh fruit, pancakes. .Our friends tried the spa and exercise facilities and were very happy, but wished they had a full day to spend ($30/day) instead of the couple of hours they had. Pools are beautiful and scattered amid very attractive landscaping with some unique plants, not just the ubiquitous Las Vegas palm tree. Don't see what is so special about Liquid, the pool/bar that they try to make so exclusive. The Elvis Cirque du Soleil show looked fun, though we didn't have a chance to see it (too many good show possibilities for only two nights!). One caution I would have about the rooms is to check your privacy setting for the doors. It seems that \"privacy\" is a default setting, controlled by a pad near the door. We inadvertently left the privacy light on when we went out for the day, as did our friends, and neither of us got our rooms cleaned for the day! Be sure to turn on the green \"service\" light when you want your room made up, or they will skip you--probably saves them on maid service.

Little things in the room did not work properly: the digital scale, one of the bedside lamps, the light on the magnifying mirror in the bathroom. In this room, you really need all the lighting you can get! On first impressions, it wasn't as luxurious as I would've hoped. Nothing major - just some minor maintenance issues that could be addressed very easily. I did like the look of the tub and shower in the same area together, but the enclosed space held heat like a steam room or sauna. Nice if you're taking a shower, but a little too much for soaking in a bath. Keep a bottle of water close by if you decide to soak! The beds are everything people say they are; both the mattresses and pillows are extremely comfy! The control panel, which acts as an all-encompassing remote for the curtains, tv, lights, etc. is touchy, but a neat, more modern feature for the room. Unfortunately, it was too cold, and we were not there long enough to experience the pool, gym, or spa areas. The staff was very courteous and friendly, and even volunteered to send something special up for my husband in celebration of the occasion (though they never did). The resort is in a nice mid-strip location. Not too far from any of the other major players. All in all, I don't know if we would stay there again. We didn't experience any of the wow factors that you couldn't already experience just by passing through the Aria while gambling or dining. A different room selection might have impacted our experience, but I was hoping to use this visit to gauge whether we would enjoy longer, future stays here in a higher grade room (since we weren't planning on being in the room much this time around.)", "title": "Not great, not bad", "user": "1karann9", "date": "January 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 150490135}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I agree with the other reviews that the beds are the best and the location is perfect.

The view was obviously better from up there but still not the greatest only because it was on an angle and facing the Cosmopolitain (which blocked alot). The room itself was great!! Beautifully appointed, loved the touchscreen (everyday we'd take a little pm nap and got to wake up with light music and the heavy curtain puuling back, very cool!), loved the big shower stall and that the toilet was behind a seperate glass door.

We did find that everything in the hotel was pricey - drinks about $14-$15 (mind you they were big and delicious), the blackjack tables i believe started at $20, etc. but oh well, we weren't going with a strict budget in mind so it was ok. We did go to Liquid one day (the VIP pool area - costs $40 to get in, but you can usually find free passes - when we went they were handing some out right before the entrance) - it was cool as you felt pampered (personal waiter) and had lots of room, comfy lounge chairs (note if you want a chair, you need to commit to spend at least $50 (each) which seemed a bit steep at first but when you look at the prices, it really only takes about two drinks and a bite to eat to ge there, lol), but we went to the \"regular pools\" the other days and felt it was almost as good (the waiters were still coming right to your chair and didnt take too too long). The hotel is pretty well situated on the strip (note though, everything in Vegas is a bit of a walk because of the size of the hotels so even if you're going just two hotels down, it'll take you a bit to get there so bring comfy shoes!!!)
