It's located directly across from the Crabtree Valley Mall. Be forewarned it is a business highway and not easy to cross. I attempted one evening to eat at the restaurant - before 7PM - but was redirected to the bar. The restaurant was closed. This was perplexing as the evening meal was advertised, plus the hotel was quite full during my stay. I inquired again, hoping for some explanation, but none was offered. The bar menu was limited; the meal ample and tasty. Room service is an option, too. In the age of ubiquitous internet, this hotel charges for in-room (Ethernet) internet service. Marriott\u2019s Springfield Suites, their budget hotel line, provides free in-room (Ethernet) internet service. The hotel may offer free Wi-Fi, but I neither tried nor needed it. The staff was friendly but did not stand out when compared to comparable hotels. So, overall, an acceptable hotel, but next time I travel to the area I\u2019ll try another hotel.", "title": "Convenient location, but did not leave me wanting to come back.", "user": "TexasEXtraveler", "date": "July 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 72485081}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Not sure if i want to come here for my next vacation, but this Hotel is very nice.

I am a Marriott Platinum Member and stay equal time at Sheratons so I am on the road the majority of the year. I really like this hotel however my company has implemented a policy that they will not pay for Internet at hotels. Basically if you want to stay at a hotel that charges internet it is on your dime. I do not consider myself cheap but I agree with my company policy and altough I have stayed at this hotel they, like most mariotts, charge for internet on a daily basis. Great hotel and unfortunitly I will have to stay at the new Residence Inn Across the street from here on out. CIAO Marriotts!
