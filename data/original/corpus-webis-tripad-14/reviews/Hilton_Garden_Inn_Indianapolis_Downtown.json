It was my favorite place to stay for the race. However, this year I was really disappointed with the experience. To start, I was given a really compact room upon arrival. One of the things I recall fondly was the large rooms and even getting a HHonors Diamond upgrade during my stays. This time I was not even acknowledged as a Diamond member and then had to complain to get moved to a larger room. Unfortunately, the room was also showing signs of age and need of renovation. I had a room with two beds and the bed I had was terribly uncomfortable. I stay at HGI often but the adjustable bed I had was not working properly and was like sleeping in a large bowl. Add to that the issue that the HVAC was not working properly and the only way to keep the room even slightly cool was to keep it running 24/7 and keeping the windows covered the entire stay. The result was also a dampness to our clothing and a loud hum of a barely working AC the entire stay. We also needed a refrigerator. Well, the one in our room was also barely cooling. I twice stopped by the front desk upon leaving the hotel and asked for someone to PLEASE look at the situation with HVAC and Fridge. I was assured they would. Well, to the best of my knowledge, nobody ever stopped by. I did not receive the ususal courtesy call/message and it was obvious neither issue was resolved. Bottom line is that I cannot recommend this hotel any longer until they begin to address issues of an aging hotel.", "title": "Used to LOVE this hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Thecard14", "date": "June 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 111997385}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "One last note, the valet parking attendant was extremely rude when we needed his assistance when we found the self parking garage was closed for Memorial Day.
