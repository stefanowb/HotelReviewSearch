The whole experience was amazing! Having booked in advance we were led to a very pleasant table where we could view the pianist and the rest of the dining area with ease. The Tea Sommelier was extremely courteous and helpful, as were all the staff. I can quite honestly say that the service was exceptional without ever feeling intrusive and the food was exquisite! From a delicious little sweet appetiser to the extremely tasty array of sandwiches (of which we had a second round ), followed by a toasted tea cake and scones with clotted cream and preserve, to the dainty little cakes. It was with regret that we couldn't quite clear everything. To top it all my mother was brought a little portion of fruit topped with a candle on a beautifully decorated plate on which Happy Birthday had been written in chocolate. The pianist asked her for a request and she was delighted that he was able to play part of the Blue Danube for her.", "title": "Afternoon Tea was delightful", "user": "Sirrah50", "date": "November 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 120013332}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "We left feeling that we had been made to feel special and truly spoiled and as such it will become a treasured memory.", "title": "Afternoon tea - without the tea", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "takemeroundtheworld", "date": "October 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 119369574}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "The whole point of paying out this much for scones, cakes and tea which you could get at your local supermarket is.....SERVICE!!

I left at 0730 after 1 night. Why? I have stayed here before (8+years ago) and now the rooms/hotel are plain worn-out and outdated. Worse, they are seemingly very cramped. My Junior Suite (rack rate \u00a31,100 approx) had only a single basin (and a small one at that) with no shelving; I've seen larger bathrooms in airport Holiday Inns. The lighting arrangements are uber complex. Touch screen pads instead of switches, bulbs blown (housekeeping where are you?!) just a irritating puzzle game to find an ambient light. Worst of all was the smoke. Floor 3 was (I was told a non-smoking floor) yet guests were allowed to smoke in certain rooms/suites. Cigar smoke pervaded the corridors and my room. I am NOT a anti-smoking fascist, I just don't want to wake up to stale cigar smoke that had wafted into my room. The St Regis 'Butler Service' is outdated and very poorly executed too, however 'well-meaning'. The whole hotel had an air of being run down, tatty at the edges. That said, the location is good-ish and breakfast was, well, just breakfast. I can't comment on their bar or dining 'experience' and my 30 min massage was capable, but expensive.", "title": "Very 'tired' hotel now.....", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RallyDriver2", "date": "November 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120806285}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I were taken to tea there as a wedding present and it was absolutely fabulous.
