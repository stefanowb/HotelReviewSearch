My husband and I travel to Paris every few months, and of all the hotels we've stayed out (pricey, fairly so, and not so) this one is by far our favorite. Have stayed there 3 times -each time, we've found the staff to be v. friendly and professional, the rooms - while not large - well priced, of decent size and v. clean, and you could not ask for a more convenient location for seeing Paris' sights.

We were delighted! We each had a single room on the courtyard. Yes, the room is small and the bathroom is very small, but no matter. Each room had ample wadrobe space, TV, mini-bar, writing desk, thick towels, quiet central AC. The hotel is very well kept, nothing shabby around the edges. Pleasant decor and very clean. I had read every review I could find before arriving in Paris - it is true that the entrance to the shower in the signle room is very small - a heavy person would have problems! And the metro does run under the hotel, but did not bother me - and I am very easily bothered by noise. I had coffee each morning in my room - it arrived a minute after I placed the call to reception. We had breakfast at the wonderful boulangerie just down the street. The hotel staff were extremely helpful. Excellent location. We felt very much at home after our 6 day stay.

But so are the many of hundreds of other hotels in Paris. The staff was very friendly upon check-in. but the room was another story. The air-conditioning was not true air-conditioning. just a tiny vent blowing air, not even cool air. The lobby was cool, but our room on the 5th floor was hot. When we inquired about the situation with the hotel staff, they seemed not even interested in dealing with it. They didn't even come up to the room to check it out. I was very dissappionted to say the least. I thought they would of at least of offered us another room.
