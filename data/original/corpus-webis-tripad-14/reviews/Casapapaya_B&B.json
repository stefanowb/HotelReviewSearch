They have a very nice dog named \"Bush\" who loves to play. We took the king room which is very comfortable ! It was spoteless and there is fresh water available 24h in the kitchen. They also provide a free wi fi access. Breakfast is excellent, with fresh fruits, cereals, yogurts , pastries dans toast. It's well located, a 10 mins walk down hill to the center.
