After 10 hours of driving i decided it was time to find a hotel. So we came across Ramada first. We figured its a big chain it should be a great place. Boy were we wrong. I checked in with my wife and 3 kids. It was over $120 for one room! I was surprised i figured they would have a cheaper rate in the winter. They told us they had a indoor pool and a nice fitness room. which were great incentives to staying. It was late so we went to our room. The doors to get into the building were so heavy! I'm a big guy and i had a hard time with them. I can't imagine a woman having to open them. We walked in and immediately noticed the stains on the hallway carpet. it looked like water damage and it took on a big portion of the hall. and where there is water damage there is usually mold. i didn't want my children walking on that! I took my family to the room. it was late so we just went straight to bed. Our sleep was interrupted several times by loud people in the hall and the guests that were staying in the rooms next to us. We could hear everything! The walls were so thin! i won't go into detail the things that were said but let me just say it was nothing i wanted my children to hear! My wife who is allergic to dogs and cigarette smoke. was coughing all night. i could tell it was from one or the other. But we got a non smoking room on the first floor where there is suppose to be no smoking rooms so how could this be right? wrong. turns out this is a pet friendly hotel too. so they let whatever in where ever not considering that people with allergies will be in that room next. After a ruff nights sleep. We went down front looking for the continental breakfast. but there was none just a over priced restaurant on site. So we went there and ordered some food. My wife found a hair in her omellette! i'm not just saying this because i found this hotel to be disgusting. it is true! it really happen. At this point i had enough of this place but the kids really wanted to go swimming. So we went in and checked the pool out. We went swimming. There was so much chlorine in that pool it made my skin feel so dry even in the water! the floor around the pool is really uncomfortable to walk on in bare feet it consists of these rock pebbles. There is no hot tub either. Also the fitness room that we were told about amounted to 4 rundown treadmills. thats it! no weights! hard floor space and worst of all no air! it was so hot inside. The wireless internet was a joke. They offer one computer on site and it was slower then dial-up! and half the sites wouldn't load. In conclusion, I would just like to say that Ramada Inn does not accommodate there guests. Everything they say they have is a joke. I would find it hard to believe that anyone would be happy staying there.

It seems as if the hotel's popularity is also a deterrent for people such as myself, especially if one is seeking a quite overnight to catch an early morning flight or a quite place to take a family without the headache of those late night hallway wanders. On this trip, the price was right so I checked into the hotel in early October as an overnight spot on my way to Florida. I must mention that I stayed on a Thursday night so there was little activity at the nightclub. Check-in was quick with a friendly desk staff. The room was surprisingly clean\u2026 I say this since I expected that the party goers may have damaged the rooms, but this was not the case. Each room offers clean, comfortable beds. Room amenities include a hair dryer, iron, ironing board. The bathroom is clean. The indoor pool was a little cooler than expected since the hotel states that the pool is \u201cheated\u201d. There is an onsite restaurant (Barnaby's Restaurant) which offers a nice, affordable breakfast. Furthermore, Barnaby\u2019s offers a lounge/bar during the evening which can offer a good spot for those seeking some nightlife or a night-cap\u2026 neither of which I can comment on as my traveling party was in bed before 9pm. The hotel offers high-speed wireless internet in room. Within walking distance is both a Tim Hortons and a Dunkin Donuts, for those looking for their favourite coffee. The hotel, like many others on Odlin Road, is only few minutes from the Bangor International Airport. During my stay, the hotel does not offer a \u201cpark-n-fly\u201d option however, long term parking at the airport is approx. $60 for a week.
