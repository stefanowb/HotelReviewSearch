If you know that outright, you will not be disappointed. It is a two story motel that has been there for decades and was renovated with new carpets, drapes, etc. It has a refrigerator, coffee pot and a meager continental breakfast. They could also use new shower heads. But the view from the balcony and the peacefulness as you sit out there over babbling Oak Creek, gazing at the red rocks and the various birds soaring about (I actually saw a bald eagle flying through the canyon for the first time in my life!) makes this a place you will want to remember forever and return to again.

All I could hear as he so called cancelled the reservation was his pathetic sighs every 10 seconds while mumbling under his breath. Then he told me that I should cancel everything and let the guests make their own reservations. I cannot tell you how rude this man was.
