There are some very negative post about this hotel, but I chose to go there anyways. I will tell you after experiencies they are true. This hotel is not worth the money or the time it takes to get there. Please dont make my mistake it will cost you time and money. Marriot has much better hotels (Aruba or St. Kitts). The only reason I gave this property two bubbles is because the view is exceptional other than that it is overpriced and average. My wife and I love going to warm beach locations. I will start off by saying that I am a big fan of Marriot hotels, just not this one. My wife and I arrived in STT at around 4pm. We took a taxi that had 11 people cramed into a 10 person van and we were charged 22 dollars per family plus tips. We arrived at the hotel around 20 mintues later to check into are dream vacation. I called the hotel about a week before we arrived to inquire about the all inclusive package that they offered. I was told I could purchase it once I arrived. When I got to the front desk I ask about purchasing the all inclusive plan, they told me I have to purchse it before I arrived( i was a little irritated). I had also requested a king bed near an elevator(my wife can not walk long distances because of medical reasons). We ended up with to double bed away from the elevator and the room was dirty. I was getting mad at this point but I thought I was just irritated because we had traveled so much that day. All I wanted was to drink a glass of wine and sit in a nice warm hot tub. While my wife was unpacking I went to check out the pools, beach, and hot tub. The pools were filled with sand and cold, the hot tub was cold and the jets did not work, and the beach was small and it was a long walk down the stairs. But they do have an elevator that will take you down to the beach (but it was broken). I walked down to the morningstar to check out their pool and it was much of the same as the frenchmans reef pool ( just average at best). To make a long story short we were so dissapointed that I spent $1200 dollars to change my flight and went and stayed at the Marriot in St. Kitts.
