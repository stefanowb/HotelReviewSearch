As I was only staying for one night, I decided not to worry about it and concentrate on enjoying the rest of the visit. On arrival at the hotel, the staff were very nice, unlike the predictions on TripAdvisor. From then on the hotel was much better than anticipated. I had a single room which was very small, but perfectly adequate, with everything I needed. It was at the back of the hotel, so had no view and was a bit on the dark side, but at least that meant it was quiet and I wasn't going to spend much time there anyway. The room and bathroom were clean and the towels were better than your average hotel towels. The bed was comfortable, there was plenty of hot water and an extra pillow and blanket in the cupboard. Breakfast was fine if you avoided the cooked offerings and there was a good selection of food. This hotel is in a good central location.
