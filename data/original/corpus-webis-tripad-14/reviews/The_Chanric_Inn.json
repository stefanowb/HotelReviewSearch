We especially liked the outdoor area (the noise from 29 didn't bother us). It was very fun to eat a delicious breakfast outside each morning (the multiple courses were a nice touch). But, we didn't want to spend a lot of time in our room. In fairness we did request the room we got, because we wanted the jacuzzi tub. But we didn't realize it would be underneath the kitchen. This meant we had to keep the shades down, as our windows looked up onto a path - that gave it a basement feel even though it was a pretty room. And then we had to listen to the disposal, the dishwasher, and other noise thumping above in the middle of the day. The house music beat was very audible downstairs, too. So it wasn't a romantic room. I did like the inn, the decor, the breakfasts, the hot tub, and the fantastic hosts.

I spent many hours researching various B&B's in the Napa Valley area. This was our 5th trip to the area over the past 3 years, so we come here fairly often for the weather, the wine and the relaxation. First, this B&B is very unique, and sets itself apart from other B&B's. It's modern and stylishly decorated with a warm contemporary feel. We stayed in a room downstairs with a king size bed and a large attached bath with jacuzzi tub/shower combo. The bed was very comfortable (almost as good as home) and the bath updated and modern. The only caveat with this room was that it was located below the kitchen. We heard some \"traffic\" noise from above around 7 am, but my husband and I are early risers, so the noise didn't really bother us. There are six other rooms to choose from. I believe there are 3 downstairs and 4 upstairs. Some have attached baths and some baths are located across the hall from their rooms. We saw three of the rooms, and they were all decorated similarly with beautiful soft white linens, and neutral wall and floor colorings. The kitchen is beautiful, and the envy of any cook! A three course breakfast is prepared each morning, and is really amazing. Kudos to Chef Ric! The first course is scones/muffins or other baked goodies, followed by a course of fruit and then the main entree. Juice and coffee are served with breakfast and is usually served on their patio (weather permitting). The patio is absolutely lovely. Citrus trees, strawberry plants, herbs and flowers decorate the stone patio. There is also dining available inside right off of the kitchen. The most unique feature is their complimentary beverage service available 24/7. There is a small refrigerator stocked with bottled water, soft drinks, wine and beer. The owners fully encourage partaking of this feature. Speaking of the owners, Channing and Ric are courteous and attentive to their guests needs. My husband and I had to leave early Sunday morning before breakfast was served, but Ric had prepared a \"to go\" breakfast of freshly baked scones, jam and butter along with coffee. What a truly nice and thoughtful gesture! I've noticed some other reviews regarding the street noise. Yes, you can hear the traffic from Hwy 29, but it never awoke my husband and me. I consider myself a light sleeper, and I never awoke because of traffic noise. There are several resorts and B&B's located off of Hwy 29, Silverado Trail etc... We've stayed in several over our five trips to the area, and road noise has been a minor factor with all of them. Channing and Ric have done an amazing job with the renovation and they provide a unique B&B experience that we will always remember!

Cons: The pool area could\u2019ve been a little cleaner. A good pressure washing of the surrounding concrete as well as a good cleaning of the bottom and sides of the pool could really make this area a lot nicer.
