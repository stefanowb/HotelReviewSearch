Hood, we were exhausted and ready for a much needed good nights sleep. After consulting our AAA tourbook we opted to stop at the Black Bear Inn to check on availability for the evening. Rooms were available and we opted for a room on the first floor. This is a motel with exterior doors which we find very convenient for one night stays. The room was pleasant, nothing fancy but certainly accommodating. What we noticed about the entire property is that it was immaculate. We did not use the pool so I cannot comment on that. The breakfast was quite good and served in a separate building that is obviously used for meetings/gatherings. It was nice to have plenty of table space for everyone and there was no need to gobble down breakfast to relinquish your table to waiting guests. Although I-5 is very close we did not notice traffic noise. There were multiple restaurants within close proximity.", "user": "ocsurvivor", "date": "June 23, 2008", "id": 17167295}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "It's seen better days", "text": "I picked this place because the pool pictures looked enticing.

I'm NOT a picky, meticulous guest, and eventually I did get a good night's sleep (the traffic noise wasn't a problem for me). But it was at the lower end of what I find acceptable, and definitely at the low end of what I'd expect in a Best Western.", "user": "Alberta52", "date": "August 13, 2007", "id": 8407861}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not bad, not bad at all!", "text": "Yet the recreational facilities were the biggest disappointment. The indoor pool was like a neglected relic from the sixties. The saunas were unappetizing. The \"playground\" was an ominous-looking concoction of rubber tires nailed to timber. I couldn't imagine my kids wanting to play there. I certainly didn't want to swim in that pool.", "user": "sebie", "date": "July 13, 2007", "id": 8113703}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "It's an okay place to stay", "text": "I recently stayed at this hotel on business. Being a government employee and limited to hotels that offer the government rate, I was limited in my choices.

The pool, my colleague informed me, was nice. It is also relatively inexpensive. Staff were helpful and polite, even going so far as to take my colleague's shirt to the dry-cleaner's for him. It's also near to several restaurants including a Denny's, and a Fred Meyer store (if you're not familiar with Fred Meyers, they are sort of the original Walmart, only the quality of what they carry is much better and the prices correspondingly a bit higher. But there isn't much you can't buy there.) It's got a small fridge and a microwave, too, in the rooms.", "user": "hlbtimes2", "date": "November 30, 2005", "id": 4154952}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "This is a great find!", "text": "The minuses: It's near the freeway and therefore noisy; the free breakfast is...well, let's say if you actually ate it, you'd pay for it...eeewww.
