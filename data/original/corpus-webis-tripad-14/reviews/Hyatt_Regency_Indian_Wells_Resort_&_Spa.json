I went with a friend to the spa and we had great massages, hung out in the jacuzzis, and made use of the outdoor showers. The hotel also lets all guests take advantage of the steam room/jacuzzis/locker rooms without paying a day admission fee. The rooms were very nice, comfortable bed, clean and modern. The bathrooms with separate shower and open bath tub were very spacious. The hotel gave us adjoining rooms so we were able to hang out with our friends. Only desire- wished there was a DVD player in the room. We had breakfast at the restaurant just off the lobby, outdoors, overlooking the golf course. It was a great relaxing meal and was not outrageously priced. My friend complained that the Starbucks charges $3 for drip coffee (same as a latte) which didn't make sense. We loved hanging out around the pool. The resort was hosting a convention and apparently the property was full, however, it felt like nobody was there. On top of everything, our rooms were free as we used Hyatt points to stay. A great value for use of points. Overall, a great visit.
