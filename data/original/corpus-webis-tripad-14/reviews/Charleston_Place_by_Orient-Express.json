The furniture and bedding were of good to very good quality and what you would expect from a hotel room of this price range. The bed was a little on the soft side, but extremely comfortable. The air conditioning was very loud and shook quite a bit, but fortunately, it was only about 80F at the hottest during any point of the stay, so it wasn't on much. In terms of in-room amenities, they need to seriously look into WiFi, or at nothing else strengthening the speed of the network during peak hours (right around 5 pm, it seemed to drag). Fortunately, there was not an extra charge to use the wired internet. The TV left much to be desired, as it appeared to be about a 19\" Panasonic Tau tube-based TV. It was very high in the armoire and not at a convenient viewing angle from the bed. Also, if you are a PPV or hotel menu based user (for things like room service, checkout, etc), please note that this hotel does not have those abilities, at least not in my room. The bathroom was nicely marble appointed, but there was some mildew in the top corner of the ceiling above the shower and a very slight amount on the curtain.

I highly recommend taking one of the carriage tours to see Charleston. It was very worthwhile, educational and entertaining. Something negative to keep in mind about Charleston is that cab rides are virtually non-existent. Many places are considered \"walking distance\" but really aren't. If you must take a cab, plan at least a one hour wait for it to arrive. Finally, avoid Atlanta Hartsfield airport if at all possible if flying to Charleston.
