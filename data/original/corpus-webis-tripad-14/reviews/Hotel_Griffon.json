I think this hotel accommodates mostly business travelers. I stayed here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night for one night as we were attending a holiday party in the close by. The room was a little small but still very comfortable and it was charming in its own way with exposed brick. The main reason I recommend this hotel so highly is that the staff were consistently friendly and helpful during our short stay. I interacted with two different people at the friend desk and two different valet people and I would rate all four very highly.

The room was beautifully appointed, from the polished wood floors in the sitting room to the copper sink in the dry bar area. I even noticed artful folding of the tissues and towels and appreciated an interesting environmentally-friendly hollow-core soap along with it's \"window\" box. Also, Perry's is great! At the bar I ordered fries and a totally crisp and \"loaded\" iceberg lettuce salad along with my wine, and enjoyed talking with Giants fans and observing other interesting tourists at the same time.

The hotel was really nice and the decor was beautiful throughout the lobby and guest rooms. My room was updated and clean, but ideal for a single person since the sink and vanity area was in the bedroom (while the toilet and shower had a separate area). I loved the exposed brick wall! The room was very small, but it was the perfect amount of space of me. I requested a bay view room, but they did not have any available, so when I opened my curtains I was staring at a brick wall and another guest room window. I kept the curtains closed because there wasn't a nice view and it didn't let in much light since I was on the second floor. I appreciated that I had my own AC unit in the room...it was a bit stuffy when I arrived and it was really helpful to cool it down and get some air circulating throughout. Finally, the food at Perry's was absolutely amazing (but a little pricey) and the room service was faster than I have ever experienced at any hotel, hands down.
