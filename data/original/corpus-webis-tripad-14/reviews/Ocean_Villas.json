Upon arrival at the airport after horrendous flights from Emirates, the car was there from the hotel to pick us up. \"Oh great\" we thought, it's raining and we have just left snow behind in the UK! The journey was well over an hour to the hotel where we were met by polite reception staff who gave us flannels and a cold drink. We had booked the new contemporary room on the beach, these were located right on the beach, 6 in total with their own private pool. They were adults only - bonus! The room was fantastic, beautifully presented and the bathroom was a knock out. In addition there was an outside shower and sunken bath - really unusual. The room was spacious, clean and have everything you need: bath plus shower, wet room type shower, his and her sinks, hairdryer, small fridge, kettle, cutlery for 2 and a TV. What I will say is that the TV only had one English speaking channel and that was a news channel that was SO repetitive. I am someone who likes to watch a bit of TV before going to sleep and this was geared for French speakers not English. We were booked in bed and breakfast only so can only comment on the breakfast. This was fine, yes it was the same every day, but there was a good selection of hot and cold food and I loved having a yoghurt with freshly cut pineapple in it with a couple of pancakes to follow. Everyone else had full cooked variety and none of us had any complaints over breakfast. I know it has already been mentioned by others about ants and insects and birds but you have to remember where you are, these things are inevitable.", "title": "Fantastic stay with our best friends", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "tokar", "date": "April 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157082500}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had the best 2 weeks, we found some lovely restaurants, went to some lovely places and had really good fun. I have read about taxis being expensive but we never found that, we would get the local bus to Sunset Boulevard and get a taxi back at night at a cost of 200 rupees (approx. \u00a35). The local bus was an experience in itself and we also got the express bus to Port Louis which was hilarious. We went on 2 fishing charters and my Husband's dream came true when he and his best friend caught a 300 lb black marlin. We also went to Casela where we had the interaction with the lions which was excellent and well worth a visit. We also spent the day at the opening day of the horse racing season and again had really good fun. My favourite place was a public beach, I think it was called Mon Choicy but we called it Choosy beach - the most beautiful beach which served fantastic food. We went on the glass bottomed boat there and went snorkelling which was good and had fun bartering with the sellers on the beach. Our favourite restaurant and would definitely recommend the Happy Rahja Indian restaurant located by the Super U supermarket.
