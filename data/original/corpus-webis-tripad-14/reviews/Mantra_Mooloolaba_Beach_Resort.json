The apartments are excellently furnished with everything you need for a long stay. We even managed to cook a few meals during our time there. The hotel has an indoor and outdoor pool, which were not overcrowded, and we used the indoor pool and gym at the end of every day\u2026there was never more than a handful of people using them. During our stay, the hotel switched from being the Outrigger to the Mantra (1st March) we even witnessed the inauguration ceremony at the front of the hotel (see photos). All the staff at the Mantra were excellent, especially the Reception staff, who couldn\u2019t do enough to make your stay as pleasurable as possible.
