I was eager about staying at this hotel having read all the great reviews, and as SPG Gold individual had high expecatations. Well, I must say the location is fantastic as others have pointed out. But outside of the great positive of the location, there were just too many other issues that still resonate with me. First, valet parking is 25 euros. Unfortunately there is no real choice for self park nearby, so we were a bit handcuffed by their fee. Second, I booked a KING size bedroom for both nights, but each time I was instead given very small QUEEN bedroom. I complained both times and both times I was told that they did not have any remaining KINGS. I even showed a printout of my reservation indicating the bed was a KING, but I was still turned away. How could this possibly have happened? I was never given an adquate explanation or provided with a resolution. Third, I wasn't given a room on the Starwood Preferred floor with the extra perks (complimentary water, free paper, turndown service) even though I am Gold. When I asked about this the front desk simply told me that they could bring me free waters. This did little to appese us. Fourth, my reservation also indicated atrium views of the interior of the hotel (looked beautiful from other member photos), yet we were given a view of construction at the ajacent building for our first stay. Overall these factors left me with a negative impression of the hotel. Besides the location, the service, the rooms, and the bait & switch tactics were all dissapointing and unpleasant. On my next trip to Dublin I'm tempted to opt for the Shelburne.", "user": "lilroy0", "date": "October 17, 2009", "id": 47095603}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The place to stay in Dublin", "text": "It's a Westin.
