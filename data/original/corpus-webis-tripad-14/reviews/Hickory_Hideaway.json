Northwestern Illinois, just east of the Mississippi River with just enough essential businesses nearby, yet secluded and quiet. There are some honeymoon-type cabins but we stayed in an adjoining duplex-type set up. One BR with fold out in living room, one full bathroom with shower, TV/VCR, movies you can borrow, A/C, and your own grill/picnic table. Comfortably slept 4 adults in each side. Communal fire pit with large swings and 4 person hot tub housed in a cozy separate building. Owners George and Sherry gracious and accommodating yet not intrusive. Plenty of room for kids to run around within sight. Watch out for the hickory nuts that bomb your cars!", "title": "What a find....less than 2 hours from Chicago!", "user": "Laurie50", "date": "September 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5773934, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Short drive, spotless cabins, plenty of outdoors but not too remote", "disliked": "\u2014 Could use full sized refrigerators in units"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Shannon"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 21}, "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "More than just lodging.
