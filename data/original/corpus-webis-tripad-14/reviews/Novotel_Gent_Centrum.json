The hotel's location was excellent, right in the centre of Gent, so easy reach to all the local shops, restaurants and bars. There was some building work going on outside the hotel but this did not affect us at all. The hotel has great facilities for a family. My boys especially enjoyed the XBox and Apple Macs in the hotel lobby. The hotel has a lovely outside pool area, we didn't use it as the weather wasn't great, but I would imagine in the summer this would be most welcome for those travelling with family. Our room was what you would expect from a Novotel - clean and comfortable. As we were a family, our room had a double bed and a sofa bed for the children, so there wasn't a lot of space but as we were there for one night, it wasn't an issue. We were unfortunate to have a view of the side ally, although online it states that most rooms have views of the town or the pool area - we were just unlucky I guess! We only booked the night before, so not really a problem. The staff were friendly, the bar and restaurant areas were welcoming. We did not take breakfast, this was quite pricey I felt.

Novotel just seem to get what families need and you never feel that your kids are a nuisance or inappropriate to be there, it is a real relief to be able to travel with children without worrying about whether they are actually welcome! This Novotel is not as stylish as the Suitenovotels, the decor in the rooms is a little basic and tired as others have said, but again with kids its good not to worried about the usual detritus - the rooms are large (we had a suite which is basically two large connecting rooms which was very useful) - the kids corner is useful - and the service was (as mostly in Belgium) friendly and efficient.
