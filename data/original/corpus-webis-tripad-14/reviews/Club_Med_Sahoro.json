It was fantastic. We have two girls 8 and 10 who had never skied before. The GO's were very welcoming and showed us around when we got there. The rooms were a decent size, although we barely spent any time in them, and the rooms and resort were very clean. We were treated to fabulous meals with plenty of variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with cuisine from Japan and other parts of the world. Everything was included even beer, wine and cocktails at the bar. The quality of the ski school was great and the teachers were very experienced. I particularly liked Olivier who was my teacher for most of the time, he was fantastic. My kids loved it, and they made new friends, in fact we didn't see much of them during the week, when they weren't skiing they were swimming in the pool or lounging in the Canadian hot tub. The snow was great, and although it does not have as many runs as Niseko, there was plenty of variety, the runs were long and there was hardly anyone there, as there are only two resorts at Sahoro. We had a feast on Christmas Eve and Christmas day. They really lived it up with shows from the GO's, our kids put on a show and the GO's dressed up for a nativity scene. I cannot fault my stay at Club Med it really was a fantastic holiday and I look forward to returning soon. Lydia, the head GO was great and ran a great team.

The rest of the hotel seems to have had a makeover recently but the rooms themselves are poor quality. We very very cramped in a 'delux' room which supposedly could sleep 5, but in fact was tiny.

Resort facilities including restaurant area was upgraded this year. Other facilities like ofuro, Canadian hot tub, squash courts (yes, if you have energy after a whole day of skiing, you can). Overall, we are happy with the physical facilities. Come mid December, I hear that there will be a skating rink created outside the resort front for kids and family. Pity we will miss that. But really - the Fantastic crew and fantastic food is what made the difference to our holiday! Lydia, Chef de Village and her G.O. team are the best. From the ski rental team, Remi, Marco, Fablo and Putu to the ski instructor teams - Keith, Jeff, James, Chloe, Pierre, Mie and the whole team. Skiing is literary ski in and ski out. If you haven\u2019t skied before, beginner lessons are great and everyone is very encouraging. Mini clubbers are also taken care of well, and had lots of fun with Nita and team. We also enjoyed snow trekking with Ade, who brought our family who did not ski, out for a trek in the snow for one hour to enjoy snow scapes. For food, there are two options - one is the buffet restaurant which serves up great quality food, always enough and top notch, great variation in menu. The other is a Nabe restaurant where you cook up your own steamboat, ramen etc. Katsu and Yuko our servers provided great service and patience in explaining how to do it right. We were a family of 14 people, half ski and other didnot. All enjoyed themselves :) very much over a 5 day 4 night stay in a winter wonderland.

It was our most expensive holiday to date! In typical club med style, everything was included, except ski rental, which for 2 adults and 1 5 year old was US$200 per day! If you want to buy ski goggles (our both broke in transit) that will set you back US$100 for the cheapest pair. Once you have put aside the giant price tag, this was an amazing holiday! If you are beginner to intermediate skiers than this is the IDEAL place. Their are plenty of bunny runs and easy poma and chair lifts for beginners, plus many gentle green runs to practice your new techniques on! The club med ski school is very clever. 5 hours of group lessons are included each day and they are divided into groups from beginner to club 6 level. depending on how many people apply for each group daily, the group is often further split depending on your ski level and technique. This allows you to ski with your same level skiers and to learn things relevant to your ski level. I really felt my skiing improved on this trip! Plus you can dedicate 5 -6 hours to skiing each day, as the kids are cared for from 8am to 5pm. They will help them dress for ski classes, feed and entertain them. Only children 4 up may ski in their ski school. age 2-3 go to the petit club. Our 3 year old really enjoyed the petit club and didn't complain once! The food was also pretty good. We are great fans of Japanese food, and enjoyed the Japanese section each day! There was of course the standard pasta and nuggets and chips and hamburgers and hotdogs each day as well as lovely salad buffets and carvery! We especially enjoyed the sushi (four times in the week) and lovely alaskan crab legs and lobster one night! The kids OD'd on the delicious hokkaido soft serve machine too! None of us wanted for anything food wise! Drinks wise, although we weren't too taken by the house red, we enjoyed the warm sake and the hot sangria (AKA gluwein) after our afternoon ski! With young kids we didn't participate in too may of the night time entertainment, but there is something on every night if you are keen. We all loved the hot jacuzzi and outdoor canadian bath as well as the Japanese onsen and sauna. It's the best way to warm up and soothe the days aches away. We had a wonderful holiday and everyone was well taken care of and catered for! Our room was very comfortable. The kids LOVED sleeping on the futons in the tatami room. We did have to ask to have our two single beds pushed together and made up into a double bed. Although the bathroom was tiny, we mostly showered after the pool and jaccuzzi or used the onsen, so only landed up using our shower in our room a few times.", "title": "Complete hassle free ski holiday for the whole family!, where all you have to worry about is your skiing", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "tourtheworld-74", "date": "January 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 123880224}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled with family", "text": "2nd time here.
