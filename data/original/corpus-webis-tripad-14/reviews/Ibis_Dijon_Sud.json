Using our satnav we located the hotel with relative ease, however at night it was difficult to physically locate other than driving past and turning around - they could do with a sign to indicate how to turn left at their junction, as the 'roundabout' surrounded the road, difficult to explain. Once in their car park - in front of the hotel, parking was easy on a Friday night - this seems primarily a business hotel, so most clients had gone home. Booking in was a simple act, they had all prepared for us, and this took no more than 5 minutes, pleasing after a 4 hour drive and after a day's work.", "title": "Overnight at Dijon", "user": "MarcusMis", "date": "December 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 121707813}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hi this hotel is great for a stopover, its no where near Dijon though, but in a small town close by.
