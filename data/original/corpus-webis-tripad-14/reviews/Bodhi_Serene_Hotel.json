We stayed in 2BR Suites room and 1 Superior room. The 2BR Suite was amazing, nice size, good size kitchen and dining table.

Breakfast was included and it was OK. Regular eggs, bacon, sausages, breads, plus fruits and rice with two thai dishes. Now the real observation.. the property is very close to 'local houses'. You can see your neighbors even their living rooms and private quarters while you are walking to your room with laundries hanging from windows as welcoming flags. The shops were loud during daytime (i think it's a motor shop), but luckily quiet down in evening. Talking about evening, please beware of mosquitos (close all windows and doors immediately). It must be a problem everything in CM during rainy season. And talking about rainy season, frogs.. and OMG frogs..you will not see them, but you will HEAR them! It is a choir at night. One or two frogs would be beautiful, back to nature kinda thing.. but if you have twenty, thirty.. fifty frogs .. man, it's too much! We complain but seems like nothing they can do.
