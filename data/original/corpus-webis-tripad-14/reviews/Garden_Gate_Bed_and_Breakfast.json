My fiance & I both loved the breakfast. Bill gave us a few more reminders that I might have skimmed over while reading about the garden gate. Remember travelers, always lock your car when you are parked at a beach close to a busy trafic area, and \"Ho`okipa\" which is Hawaiian for extend hospitality.
