Family of four including 15 year old daughter and 11 year old daughter; we have two rooms. The hotel is located in small village near top of pass, very beautiful location. The hotel is newly built, modern and clean. But this is where it ends.... first issue is that they advertise \"wireless internet\" and I am on working vacation; I need access 3-4 hours per day. Room had no access, only lobby after you procure special password from front desk. But then after this, I find out it does not work in the lobby! After alot of complaining, they put me in small side room [business office] where I have to unplug LAN cable from their computer and put into my laptop. 4 Star hotel should have internet in room!", "title": "3.5 Star, Not 4 Star!", "user": "gtpatton", "date": "June 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 17327757, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, views", "disliked": "\u2014 no internet; no coffee"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Then next issue, where is the coffee? 4-star should have coffee in the room, or hot water heater and cups [I am smart enough to pack my own instant coffee packs].
