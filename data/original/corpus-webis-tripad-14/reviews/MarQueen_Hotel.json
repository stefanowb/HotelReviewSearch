I stayed at the Marqueen in Room 202. It is a beautiful, historic, \"Boutique\" hotel that I found quite charming. As mentioned before, the building used to be apartments, therefore the rooms are HUGE! Ours had a nice bathroom, sitting room, bedroom, and kitchen...and as far as I know it wasn't a suite. Ours was at the front of the hotel, overlooking the street. As mentioned previously, there is a lounge-type restuarant across the way that apparently gets loud on the weekends. We stayed on a Monday and Tuesday night, and there was no noise besides reagular city noise (i.e. bus passes until around midnight). I think on Tuesday I heard some people talking loudly on the street, but it was not enough to wake me out of full slumber. The room itself was immaculate...they must employ an excellent cleaning staff! I have two complaints of a sort... One, like a pp mentioned, the reservations staff are not willing to guarantee you a room in the back. I called and asked that a note would be put on my account about this preference, but I was told when I checked in (early) that I had been assigned a front room, and that the back rooms were filled. She mentioned that it was the only room clean for the moment. So I took it, and it worked out okay. I think they give priority to those who book through the hotel, and not through a travel site. Which is too bad, considering we all pay money for the room. The other thing is that the plumbing in this place is old. Expect the water pressure to a bit off, and there to be a lot of noise when the water comes on. We did receive a letter upon checking in stating that the plumbing was being worked on, so perhaps they are looking to remedy this problem. Also, there is not a great deal of counter space in the bathroom, so you can't really spread out. I think they went for ambience when they chose the pedestal sink over a counter top one.

It doesn't open until 11am though, which was difficult for me since I was attending a conference at started at 9am each morning. Taxis in town are expensive! I paid close to $8 with tip for a two mile ride! Bring your walking shoes! Otherwise, this is a great city. I don't think I have ever been somewhere so friendly, and I'm from the South!

The bed was very comfy. There are plenty of things to do right outside of the hotel. Nice restaurants, friendly neighborhood pubs, shopping. It was clean, it was cozy and we loved it. It's only a few minutes in a cab from the Space Needle and the Warf. If you are brave enough to get out and walk in the weather it's only about 15 minutes walk down to the Warf. The staff are super friendly and more than willing to help you find your way around the city. The restaurant that they use for guests does do room service, but again, you have to go outside. Oh, and in the room, there is a coat/linen closet. Now, it didn't bother us, but some people might find it odd. When you open the door, you see two cozy robes, towels, pillows, and then you will notice that it's actually the hot water heater \"room\". It's quite large but dark.
