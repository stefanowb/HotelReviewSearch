It costs $62US. Taking the shuttle bus if $18 per person. They didn't charge kids. However, they made about 5 stops on the way. We were the last stop. It took about 1.5 hours of driving, with all the stops. It took 30minutes to wait for them to gather enough people to start the trip. Not worth it. Taxi is best. The taxi fare back to the airport is $40. From what I understand, it's more expensive going out of the airport due to aiport taxes. The resort is big and it was about 1/2 occupied, as most people returned home for school time. It was great. Plan on doing some walking. they offer a golf cart type shuttle service but you have to wait about 5-10 minutes for it to arrive. We used it to get to and from the beach. The swimmable beach is great for kids. They even rent you snorkel gear for free, to use on the property only. It's not a big beach by any means, but it was perfect for us due to our 4 yr old. Very calm water. The swimming pool is pretty large but is not connected to each other. I think they have 3 large pools. One being the largest and main pool. They offer free floating tubes(donut kind). Bring the bed floaties, if that's the kind you like. We stayed in bldg 20. Building 19 and 20 are the most central to the resort. Equal distance from the restaurants/lobby and the beach. Also, it is the closest to the swimming pools. The rooms are just rooms. They're clean and well stocked with cold drinks. What more can you ask for. If you want great rooms you need to go to the Moon Palace. We did the buffet every night, because we have a 4 yr old and waiting for food to arrive just wasn't in the game plan. Also, I 'm on vacation and I am not going to wear long pants in the hot, humid tropical weather. Paco's Tacos doesn't require a reservation and it's pretty good. The buffet food is 3 out of 5. It could have been better. We've been to Moon Palace 2x and Dominican Republic 2x. All were all-inclusives and I would have to say that this place probably had the best food (which isn't saying all that much). I just can't understand why cruise ship chefs can make such good food in mass quantities, but all-inclusive places can't come even close. It's a quandry. The free pass to Xcaret was fun. The underground river swim was fun. The water is extremely cold. The night show is worth watching, so come back for the show. It's literally a 5-7 minute walk to the Xcaret entrance from the resort. Very close. We rented the snorkel gear at Xcaret for $10 but it was not necessary. The entertainment at nights were pretty decent and probably the best out of all the resorts that I've been to. The singer and the band are very good. She sounds exactly live Melissa Etheridge. The Latin Explosion show was great. All the other evening shows were just OK. the people are friendly and helpful. I would go back. The only two things they could change to make it better is: 1) Better food, 2) More frequent shuttle service.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 8, 2004", "id": 2519301}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I was in Paradise", "text": "Overall we had a great time.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 7, 2004", "id": 2516535}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "It's hot.

This is a large resort--from the lobby to the beach area is about a 15 minute walk. We were in building 18 which was a good location-close to main pool, towel shack and restaurants. They do have tram service. Pool temp was VERY refeshing--actually pretty cold--and I do not say that very often. Weather was fickle--nice, clear mornings but intermittent clouds in the afternoons-but surprisingly not humid! Brochures listed Mediterranean restaurant but that was the same as the Italian (same menu). Was able to make 4 dinner reservations on the same day without a long wait. Did not eat at the Oriental or Seafood restaurant. Seafood restaurant is down by the beach-so take the tram-it's somewhat dark at night. Other restaurants were good but portions not that great--much better variety of appetizers and desserts at the Iberostar hotels--and this includes the buffet restaurant--but unless someone is very picky, you could always find plenty to eat. One plus is that the buffet restaurant has AC as do the other restaurants although it was hot in the Mexican restaurant. There was occasionally a smell from the lobby river but nothing too terrible. Rooms are a good size and clean- no problems with towels. Some annoyances were: 1) toilet paper holder was installed about 8 inches from the floor 2)worlds smallest garbage cans with a flip up top in the bathrooms and 3) hair dryer switch had to be held constantly--no on/off switch--slightly frustrating when you have thick hair and it takes about ten minutes to dry it!! Fridge was restocked every day. Resort was a 50 minute drive from the airport (via \"limo\" service) so longer if on a bus stopping at different resorts along the way. Staff were friendly in all areas. Went to the Xcaret park nightly show--over 2 hours long--very entertaining and colorful. Nightly shows at the resort were good.

We all would definitely return. As for the points made by others in their reviews, pretty much all true. But what those reviews didn t give me is any type of perspective that was useful to me. I will attempt to do that here.Smell: Upon rare occasion we did notice a smell from the river. But the odor is very mild, and as I said rare. Perspective: Most of New York s Manhattan Island or San Francisco s China town have much stronger, much more prevalent smells and remember these cities are loved by millions. (I won't go into details about Venice Italy.)Expansive Grounds require walking: True. Perspective: Nothing compared to a trip to Las Vegas. I frequently travel to Las Vegas and usually stay at one of the major casinos. A walk through Caesars Palace or from your room to the pool at Mandalay Bay seems farther, and much, much more confusing than getting around the Grand Flamenco.Friendly Staff: We found the staff to be very friendly to anyone that was even remotely reasonable. We also witnessed a woman from New Jersey have a fit and was yelling because something wasn t to her liking. The staff still managed a smile, but dealt with her as kindly as possible. My kids were appalled. If she had tried that in any New York hotel, she would have gotten a very different response!I think you get the picture. My wife, kids and I didn t want to leave.Some other information I would have liked to have before our visit: -The Xcaret park is only about one long city block walk from the hotel restaurant area so you can visit the park and return for dinner before the evening show. -Take a taxi from the airport. Even the small shuttles stop a lot and hence eat up a lot of time and the cost is almost identical! - The worst exchange rate we found was at the Cancun Airport.

My husband took the scuba dive trips, loved them. The parks get full in the afternoon, the mornings are empty- good time to snorkel and explore. Bars are excellent- never have to wait for drinks. We did tip our maid and waiters when we had exceptional service, but they did not act like they expected it.

The hotel is well spread out and was not full when we were there (End Oct 03) but unless you are seriously lazy it will not bother you - nothing is more than 10 minutes away and there are golf carts sporadically collecting people along the journey if you are.

We booked 4 restaurants on day one (with no queues or availability issues I add) for our 1 week stay and went to all but the seafood one. Each one was different and lovely. The pools were empty and I stress the second pool is by far the nicer and it even has waiter service when it is quiet. We are not into laid on entertainment so I cant comment on the quality but imagine it is pretty standard across the Caribbean. The beach was small and manmade - but beautiful. We are pool people so only wandered down for a look and it was also deserted. We didnt use any of the restaurants by the beach so can't comment on them.

We are a single couple with sophisticated tastes and loved it but I can see how it would be a haven for kids as well.
