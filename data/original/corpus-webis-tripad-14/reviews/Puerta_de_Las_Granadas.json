My partner and I were not disappointed, the hotel lived up to all the good reviews (like the great service at receiption and the position) and even to the bad ones. the only bad thing being the size of the room - it was very small as was the bathroom but we expected this from the reviews and as we spent our time out and about in beautiful Granada it didn't really matter too much although we did stay for 7 nights and a little more room would have been good. The staff at reception were absolutely wonderful and spoke English fluently. We came to depend on them for assistance because we found that in Granada (as in Madrid) not many people spoke English and there was also a decided lack of printed information for tourists. Even the tourist office were very unhelpful, unlike the wonderful staff at this beautiful little hotel, the hotel actually had more printed information in English than the tourist office! As we had been travelling for 10 days or so and the weather was unexpectedly cold and wet our few warm clothes were desperately in need of a wash. When I asked for directions to the nearest laundromat I was told that the hotel would do the washing for us at no extra charge - amazing. Of course we left a tip for this service. Also one night we came back to our hotel after a particularly long cold and wet day to find a beautiful tray with on our bed with fresh fruit and and a bottle of wine and 2 wine glasses, but great things like that happen to Aussies when we travel because usually we are friendly and undemanding and undemanding.

We realise where relaxation comes from, not from fancy rooms and marble bathrooms, but from cordial staff, cleaniness, and proximity to tourist attractions. Yes, the sizes of the rooms here are a quarter of those in Cordoba, but we welcome the \u00b4coziness\u00b4 of them. Also the free internet and unlimited tea and coffee are simple basics that are priceless when you have spent the whole day outside. The last thing we want to do, but HAD to do in cordoba was search for a nice cup of ENGLISH tea after a day of sightseeing ( we had to settle for McDonalds in Cordoba!)

Great value for the money, especially since we are from the US and the euro exchange rate is hefty right now. My only downside is that our room (which was the cheapest we could find in the hotel at this time of year of low season at 60ish euros) was on the smallish side (like about a 100 sq ft-ish) which is just enough size for two people but if you're going to be spending most of your time outside visiting the area and only sleeping in the room shouldn't be a problem.", "title": "Modern Hotel, Excellent Location.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "clee1402", "date": "October 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 46573172}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "A quick side note about Granada, I heard from a few people that it is one of the the cheapest city in Spain(which my spouse said was also true based on the souvenirs she looked at in various cities) so I would stock up here if i were you!", "title": "Great service, good location, wonderful views from top floor", "user": "carped", "date": "October 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 46264830}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just a short walk (uphill) from the Alhambra.

The front desk staff speak excellent English and are surpassingly helpful (especially the excellent Alexandra). They will likely volunteer to arrange your Alhambra tickets in advance and can also explain where to leave your rental car rather than venture into the old quarter of Granada with it. (There is no parking right at the hotel.) There are generally two computers to use in a lounge area for free internet access (and the most blazing WiFi speeds we encountered anywhere in Spain), but one of the desktops was absent/broken when we were there. The rooms are okay but not a place you want to spend a lot of time - everything is clean but very simple, and the pillows are none too cushy. The breakfast (not included - about 8 or 9 euros/person when we were there) is a bit perfunctory - coffee simmering on a hot plate, some decidedly industrial pastries, some cheese, ham, and fruit, and yogurt and plain-ish cereal. It would take some work and tolerance to really fuel up for a good part of the day with that spread, but it is certainly an acceptable way to grab a quick bite. Despite the limitations of the rooms and breakfast, I would recommend this to anyone not looking for a four-star experience but wanting proximity to the Alhambra, a decent room, and helpful staff. (The four-bullet rating here is NOT intended to be parallel to a four-star rating; this is more like a two-star hotel except for the excellent front desk folks.)
