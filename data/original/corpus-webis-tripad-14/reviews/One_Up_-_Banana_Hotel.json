Arun and his team provide an outstanding service. The hotel is well located, conceived and appointed. The rooms are spacious with all amenities one would expect. The beds aren't as firm as others we have experienced in SE Asia. The staff helped booking buses and the hotel's trusty tuc tuc driver took us everywhere we wanted for a very reasonable cost. It is bice to stay somewhere with a social concience.

Amazing customer service, greeted with lovely iced drink and recognised everytime we came back. Manager always had time to talk with us and ask us about our day. Very helpful arranging tuktuk tour and with local area info. Can pay more for English speaking driver but not sure what they would add and our driver spoke more than enough. We paid $20 and were taken to prison s-21, killing fields and Russian market. Then dropped back at hotel before being taken to water front in early evening and picked up after dinner. Roof top terrace nice for a sundowner. Be aware 2 of the rooms are on ground floor by reception. We didn't experience any undue noise though and there is 24hr reception so felt safe. Rooms are large and clean. Breakfast is optional extra which can be delivered to your room but relatively pricey and lots of other breakfast options in easy walk.", "title": "Tucked away from the chaos", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Rhian H", "date": "August 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174960879}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Very clean and nicely decorated room .", "title": "An oasis in Phnom Penh", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MeInAsia", "date": "August 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 174905367}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Really comfy place with friendly and helpful staff.", "title": "Best Hotel In Cambodia", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Hamid S", "date": "August 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174603679}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I loved it!", "text": "There is a kitchenette,balcony,safe,fridge,flat TV screen .", "user": "yuanhong", "date": "August 27, 2013", "id": 174253613}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "In the heart of a Phnom Penh.", "title": "A Little Haven........", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Lyrebird6", "date": "October 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 181048442}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We loved it here for various reasons.", "title": "Fantastic Hotel Stay", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Kathy R", "date": "October 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 180875372}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "It is in a great spot, it's quiet, spotlessly clean and has lovely helpful staff.", "title": "Hidden Gem", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "atcBangkok", "date": "October 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179883822}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled solo", "text": "ROOM 2 is beautifully furnished but tiny.", "title": "Best hotel in Phnom Penh", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Alex P", "date": "October 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179647054}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013", "text": "Small balcony off the bedroom hints of more space.", "title": "Luxury for a backpacker", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Cluelessduo", "date": "October 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 179551762}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "We arrived at One Up Banana Hotel in the evening and stayed for 2 nights on the 15 - 16 Sept.
