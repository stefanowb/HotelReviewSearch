It is a charming little hotel and very comfortable. When booking online, you are invited to choose your room from the list of all those available, each of which has its floor plan and details displayed. This is possibly one decision too many for the armchair trip planner to have to make! However we were very happy with the room we chose (number 5, overlooking the garden). One quaint feature of the room was that one wall of the bathroom is clear glass, so that whoever is in the bath or on the toilet can see (and be seen by) not only the other occupant of the room but also, if the curtains are open, whoever is in the garden. This was not a problem for us, but others might like to be warned. Despite large numbers of tourists in the town, our room was very quiet and peaceful, and we were able to park close to and within sight of the hotel. It was, however, very hot outside and the absence of air conditioning in our room was a bit of a drawback. Temperatures in Ljubljana rarely make air con a real necessity, though. Breakfast was tasty and copious, with the usual array of meat, cheese, eggs, cereal, fruit, bread, croissants and the slightly less usual squeeze-your-own orange juice. Daniel and Matjaz at reception were very helpful, and fed the parking meter for us in the morning. Lots of good places to eat within a couple of minutes walk.", "title": "Lovely hotel, room 2 is disappointing", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "jimbo1683", "date": "July 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8035073, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Hot and stuffy budget room"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled on business", "text": "We would warmly recommend the Hotel Antiq and would certainly stay there again.", "title": "better than OK!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Ozprofpaul", "date": "June 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 8025891, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 noise/no air-con"}}], "location": {}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 14, "average": 32, "very good": 91, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 97}, "aka": "Antiq Hotel Ljubljana", "slim_ranking": 0.464285714286, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Nestled in the historic town centre of Ljubljana, the Antiq Hotel offers 16 charming guest rooms with views of the magnificent Ljubljana Castle or the romantic Gornji Trg square, this cosy boutique hotel is a peaceful haven just a stone-throw away from the busy cobble-stoned streets of the Old Town with its numerous cafes, restaurants and boutique stores."}
