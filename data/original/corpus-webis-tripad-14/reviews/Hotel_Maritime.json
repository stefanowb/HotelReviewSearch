It was relatively inexpensive, and the rooms are small, to be sure, with a small bathroom as well, but you can't beat the location. The shopping and canal areas are just a few minutes walk, even the Little Mermaid is a comfortable walk. Great complementary breakfast and coffee/tea is available all day, which went perfectly with our Danish pastry purchases. Really good value.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "PaulaRuth", "date": "June 5, 2004", "id": 2155148}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great hotel!", "text": "I stayed at this hotel just before Christmas 2003. It was centrally located and just a short walk to all attractions. The facilities were clean and the staff were very friendly. We unfortunately missed our first night at the hotel due to flight cancellations and they did not charge us which i thought was excellent given the late notice. Only complaint was that we booked a double bed but received a room with 2 singles - only to be told there were no doubles available. I see another reviewer had the same problem with this, so keep this in mind!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "AndieC", "date": "April 7, 2004", "id": 1767140}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent value!", "text": "My friend & I went here for a \"girls weekend\" and were pleasantly surprised to find this 2 star had been upgraded to a three star - it was clean, the water pressure was great, and the heaters worked very well (which comes in handy February in Denmark). The breakfast offered lots of options. Overall, this is a great value your money!

If you want a double room, be sure to specify if you want two twins together or separate -- my wife and I didn't do this and were stuck with two separate twins that the room dimensions did not allow us to rearrange without difficulty. The bathroom was modern and a pretty good size for a European hotel.
