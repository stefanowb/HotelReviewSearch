Two days prior to my arrival, I received an email from the manager saying that I had been \" upgraded\" to a suite as their had been an \"incident\" in my reserved room and I would not be able to stay there. I assumed that because I had given the hotel specific instructions regarding not wanting to be street side that this would not be an issue. The room that they assigned us was precisely the very one that the reservations person and I had spoken of when I was making my initial reservation and I had opted out of this room (corner suite, street side).", "title": "Trying to get a good nights sleep at the Nelligan is like trying to get a good night's sleep as a patient in a hospital!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "penelope1961", "date": "January 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 148963358}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled solo", "text": "A friend recommended this hotel to me, but I found it dismal and uninviting.", "title": "Noisy and disappointed!", "user": "citygirlcountryheart", "date": "July 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 170226587}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "As I recall, it's decor was mostly black with touches of red, and it was dark and depressing.
