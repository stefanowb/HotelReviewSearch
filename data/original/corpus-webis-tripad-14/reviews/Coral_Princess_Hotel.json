Located on a one way street a mile from the main 26 freeway, it\u2019s a short walk to many restaurants in Condado and a block away from Walgreens and the beach. Jose, the desk clerk was a very nice, amiable, very helpful, polite and accommodating. There is a small shallow swimming pool on the first floor, a Jacuzzi and pool table on the 3rd floor and a piano on the 1st floor. Deli meats, toast, croissants, bananas and yogurt are available for breakfast which is served from 6-10am each morning. There is cable and a fridge in the room which useful for stocking up on snacks and my only very minor issue was the shower which seems to change from hot to cold constantly so we resorted to talking baths in the nice Jacuzzi style bath tubs in the rooms. If you are renting a car there are only a couple of spaces available outside the hotel (which were always in use), but we were able to find parking spots each day across the street from the hotel so never had to pay to park. I am truly a fussy traveler and it took me several months of researching before I settled for this charmer (thanks to previous posts!!) and it was truly worth the money. The rooms are rather small (not as small as some in Europe) and I took a peek into 3 other rooms which are all similar in size and d\u00e9cor.

The room was really nice and clean and was a bit small but we spent very little time in it. Yes, the water temperature does fluctuate a bit, but honestly, it's not a big deal. Our room had a fridge where you could purchase cheap bottles of water and soda. My boyfriend thought there was a bit too much hallway noise, but compared to other hotels I've stayed at I think it was pretty minimal. There was a continental breakfast which was completely purchased things from Costco, but it was adequate. And they served it until 10:00 which was nice. Finally, the pool is small, but was very cute and nice. It is shaded in the afternoon, which was nice for me with my fair skin.

(though the staff allowed my friends and I to stay in until 11,which was considerate).The food at the nearby Cafe Angel(try the mofongo if you want a taste of the national dish)was excellent;reasonably priced and huge portions.Also the Black Angus Steakhouse serves the best steaks that you could ever ask for.There is a Walgreens around the corner.If you want to go to Old San Juan or the mall(The Plaza of the Americas)you don't need to waste your money on a cab;the B21 bus runs right near the inn and drops you off there as well(every 20 minutes).It costs just .75 cents each way.The exact change is required.Overall,I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who is budget conscious and just wants somewhere clean and homey to stay for a short time.It is no Hilton,but then you don't pay Hilton prices either.
