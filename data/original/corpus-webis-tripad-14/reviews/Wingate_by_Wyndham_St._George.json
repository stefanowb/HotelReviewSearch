Complimentary breakfast included make-yourself waffles (delicious!), yogurt, bagels, cereals, juices, coffees, eggs, sausage. Really good value and good way to kick off your day. Staff was friendly too. Hotel is located almost adjacent to Wal-Mart, which was convenient for stocking up on water, snacks.

He asked me what brought me in to their facility, and the poor soul didn't expect to hear all the drama that boiled down to a wrong turn onto the 93N Freeway out of Las Vegas, instead of the 95N. He was so sympathetic to me and concerned, I felt his genuine kindness and was immediately reassured my choice to stay here. I was astonished at the beautiful room I was given. It was impressively clean and fresh feeling. Everything was updated, from the linens to the LCD TV's that were mounted on the wall. A more relaxing evening to the end of my stressful day was found in the GIANT jetted bathtub! The hotel has a spa and pool, laundry and business facilities.

It seemed as if he didn't even make an effort to help us. This really set my traveling partner off and was the beginning of what ended up being the most horrific hotel stay ever. The swimming pool was freezing with leaves in it and looked to be unsanitary, the breakfast was completely generic, and there never seemed to be any management around to speak with about it.
