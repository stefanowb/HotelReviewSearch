The Hotel I must say had the same feel as a resort in Mexico or the Bahamas with just as many amenities. The beach was awesome and was very flat and it was very even when walking out into the ocean. There were plenty of things to do and many very good restraunts that were very convienient. The elevators were very slow and we utilized the stairs when we could. Housekeeping was a little slow in tidying the rooms because they would concentrate on getting the rooms of checked out guests cleaned first. We loved the barcrawl tshirts which is something you obtain by drinking an adult beverage at one of the five bars located on the resort property. The drinks were reaonably priced and not watered down and I must say the exotic drinks were some of the best I have ever had. We had a two room suite which we wished would have been a little bigger but it was acceptable. The balcony was very narrow and the deck chairs could only sit sideways so that was a disappointment. We did not spend a lot of time in the room because of all of the activities and things we were doing so it really wasn't that big of a deal. The resort was really crowded but we never had difficulty finding loungers,cabanas, or even getting into the pools. When we did eat at the resort, there were not long waits to be seated and the food was good but a little pricy. The water activities and Kids Club were also a bit pricy. I must say I did a lot of research on the resorts in Florida and the reason we picked the Tradewinds was for the KONK club. We were not impressed and in fact it was our biggest disappointment. The staff were not familiar with the activities and they were in some cases very cheesy. We had a 5, 6 and 10 year old. We checked into the video game activity but the staff were unfamiliar with the gaming system they had, what games they could play, or even what an evening of video games looked like so we could get some type of picture of the activity before we paid $30.00 to attend. We participated in the tie dye tshirt activity which was not coordinated very well. There were two staff for 15 kids and there were no protectors for the kids and they had dye everywhere. My kids had to sit and wait for a long time because of the lack of staff assistance. We participated in a candy activity where the kids filled tubes of candy with colored sugar. It was over within 5 minutes and there was no interaction with the kids by the staff. We participated in an ice cream pop activity. Our children were the only kids who attended. The ice cream was melted and to soft to put on a stick so they plopped it on little plates and told the kids to put thier toppings on it and eat it but they didn't have spoons. They handed the kids tounge depressors and told the kids they would have to use them to eat the ice cream. The staff member looked all over the kids club for spoons but couldn;'t find any. Eventually the melting ice cream was disposed of in the trash because it could not be eaten without a spoon. We were going to attend the sea glass jewelry activity but when I stopped over to ask the staff what the beads looked like to see if it would even be worth it, the staff member did not know where the glass was and did not even know what the activity entailed. Our final and last go at the activities was feeding the fish. We thought it would include something fun and exciting but my kids were horribly disappointed when they found out it consisted of throwing some fish food in the fish tank in the KONK club and they couldn't even reach it so the staff had to do it. We just decided the activities cost to much for the quality of the program and decided not to attend any more.

I believe its very difficult to have great food at any all-inclusive. There are many options to eat off the resort as well, so I suppose they know that and try to make an amazing dining experience. We ate at the fine dining Palm Court, and while pricey, and perfectly cooked/seasoned NY strip. We also ate at Bermuda's and had amazing fish tacos, and one of the best burgers I have ever had. We ate dinners normally at 9:00-9:30 and food quality seemed to always be fantastic no matter what time we ate.", "title": "Absolutely LOVE this place.

The resort is absolutely beautiful. Everybody that was employed at this property was very friendly and helpful. The resort has everything a person could ever want. It would be possible to fly in to tampa, take a shuttle to TradeWinds and never leave. The beach is just beautiful! One morning I got up with my daughters and went out on the beach and was looking for shells. We heard some people talking about something out in the water. We looked, and a group of dolpins had come up pretty close to the waters edge to feed. What an experience. And if you go to TradeWinds, the best place to lay and relax is in the hammock where the live web cam is. My husband laid in the hammock and talked to his brother here in oklahoma while his brother watched us play in the sand on the web cam. This resort goes over and above any place i have ever stayed. I would highly recommend that everyone stay at this resort. You won't be disappointed. It was my first stay, but it won't be my last! The view from our balcony was so pretty and relaxing. Every night we would sit out on the balcony and listen to the live music from the tavern on the property. It was a very relaxing trip. There are several pools to choose from. You can paddle boat. This resort even has beach toys if you choose to build sand castles. Everything has been thought of.
