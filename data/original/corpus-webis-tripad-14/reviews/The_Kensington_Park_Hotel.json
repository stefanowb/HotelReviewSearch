We stayed at the Kensington Park Hotel and this is where we will stay if/when we return to the city. The location is perfect - it's literally in the heart of Union Square. Union Square, to me, was definitely touristy and not really my favorite part of town, but the central location is perfect. My husband and I love to walk around and explore the city and this allowed for us to do so very easily. Also, if you're new to San Fran, you feel really safe because there are always lots of people around.

As mentioned by other reviewers, this is an older hotel which adds to the charm. Rooms are small but have been modernised and are very inviting.

We were right on union square with shops, restaurants & bars right on our doorstep without the need for taxis, public transport etc. The rooms were v.spacious, extremely comfy beds & modern looking also had free wifi. Great rates generally available in comparison to some other hotels that seem dingy and very old fashioned!! Definitely recommend staying here over Fishermans Wharf which is fine for an afternoon & a burger but nowhere for you to enjoy a nice meal & btl of wine etc. Only downside was the parking at $35 per day but you can't escape this if u want to stay in this central area.
