The absence of both cigarette smoke and children made it a really relaxing time, and I can't recommend it highly enough. The resort is so clean, and the staff so friendly and helpful - it's one of those places where they bother to remember your name, and every day they seem pleased to see you. Most of our time was spent around the pool, and it was just beautiful. We had just come from a week in Las vegas, so it was somewhat moving from the ridiculous to the sublime, and it was a perfect way to finish off our trip. I can't say we had any problems at all - and despite what other reviewers have written, I didn't find the food at all expensive, and it was really good quality. Another benfit of the Pacifica is the size - it's tiny compared to the other huge resorts in Los Cabos, so you really feel as if the focus is on you, and ensuring you have the best stay possible.

It was my first time in Cabo, my g/f 3rd time. She has stayed at Las Ventanas and The One and Only before. She liked the Pacifica over both of them. It really truely is a peaceful restort. From the moment you walk into the tranquil lobby to when u exit the lobby to the incredible view. We had booked the 1 room suite and luckily got the 5th floor which is the highest. Loved the room but loved the balcony even more. The beds (2 queens) were very comfortable and they even have a 'pillow' menu for you to choose from about 5 different pillows for your comfort. The bathroom was very spacious and very well decorated/designed. The only problems I had with the room was the furntiure didnt appear to fit the room. The coffee table was too large to fit between the couch and the TV stand and the night table between the beds was the exact height as the light/fan switches. We did have an issue with ants, which I thought was very odd being on the 5th floor, but the problem was taken care of. The entire hotel and grounds were extremely clean and well taken care of. Lots of staff on hand everywhere. They have a full day of 'activities' set up ranging from towel folding (which was fun) to horseshoes, darts and ping pong. So we did decide to do the timeshare presentation as the lady promised $200 in food credit and $100 spa. The Pueblo Bonita Sunset is just up the hill and where the timeshares are and it turned out to be a sour experience. Property appears nice on the tour but then when it came to 'sell' time the guy Mike turned extremely rude when we stated we wanted to research it more or to run the numbers better. He go so rude we just got up and left and didnt even get our vouchers, wasnt worth the hassle. Then on our 3rd day we went to the Sunset (you can use all the Pueblo Bonita's properties) we were extremely unimpressed by the service and the need wait for the golf carts to go anywhere. The Pacifica is head and shoulders above the Sunset. Only problem is a lack of places to eat at the Pacifica but you can take a free shuttle to town or to Sunset to eat. We both would go back to the Pacifica again as it was a 10 out of 10 for a very relaxing vacation.", "title": "The perfect getaway", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "outsidehammer", "date": "November 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 22296807, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The relaxing atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of places to eat."}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed here for 5 days two years ago.
