The rooms are nicely decorated, the breakfast is delicious and the view is beautiful. There are a couple of very good restaurants within a few minutes drive and a couple of day excursions with fantastic views. It was such a treat to be off the tourist path after several weeks of traveling to all the hot spots in Europe.

Just use your GPS-it's a pretty 30 minute drive from and/or the historic treasures of Coimbra! This is a deluxe bed and breakfast at a reasonable price. I really appreciated the tranquil and soothing accommodations, amazing breakfasts, and warm hospitality of this couple.......as did many other reviewers!", "user": "ChadGigHarbor_WA", "date": "July 10, 2012", "id": 134062504}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful B&B!", "text": "We spent three days at Casa nas Serras and loved this place from the very first moment. It looks just as great as on the website's pictures, and Angelique and Frederik make you feel like being at home. We very much enjoyed the rich breakfast on the terrace with a splendid view into the green mountains, and a swim in the big pool. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was just amazingly comfortable. As the surrounding area offers many things to do (we drove to Coimbra and went canoeing on the Mondego river), Casa nas Serras is a great starting point for excursions. A place to remember and a place to recommend!", "user": "David Q", "date": "June 19, 2012", "id": 132295911}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lovely hospitality in casa nas serras", "text": "My husband and I stayed two lovely nights on april.

Just sitting on the porch for the delicious breakfast we were surrounded by the sounds of birds, children in a nearby playground, and the wind in the trees. Frederik kindly answered our endless questions about the history of the restored house, the well, and the neighbor's shed full of farm animals.

The B&B is warm, clean and modern with Moroccan accents and great deck furniture. Unfortunately, it wasn't warm enough to use the pool - but that just means we'll have to come back in the summer!! We couldn't put our camera down. Sitting on the patio in the sunshine we enjoyed our hearty breakfast while breathing in the beautiful scenery. The view is amazing. The countryside rolls in front of you and the sky stretches on. It's such a peaceful way to start the day. The breakfast is plentiful. A choice of fresh fruit, a variety of bread from the local bakery (or if you're even luckier they baked it themselves), cheeses, meat, honey and jam (to die for & yes you can buy some at the duty free on the flight home), yogurt, cereal, hard boiled eggs and on special occasions, pancakes. Beyond delish and seconds aplenty. It's true what others have written. Angelique and Freddy are lovely. Very knowledgeable and full of resources. We showed up having done NO research and they guided us to interesting sites. We went on a day trip to Coimbra (great shopping, cute cafes and a Botanical garden along the river which is perfect to walk off the pastries!), out for dinner at a local restaurant (had the best spiced chicken I've ever had - I'm from Canada - it beats Swiss Chalet ;) and also to this authentic palace nestled in a forest with a great hiking trail and magnificent views (believe it or not we saw a DOUBLE rainbow). When not out sightseeing we were enjoying the room which is cozy and has the most comfortable beds. Slept so well and for hours. We both fell in love with Portugal but my boyfriend has a soft spot for Chopin - one of the cutest, shaggiest dogs ever. A truly wonderful experience. We look forward to returning when it's even hotter and with our friends and family in tow.
