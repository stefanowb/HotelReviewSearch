They have obviously never experienced greece at all! the description of this hotel is of probably 90% of the apartments all over the country! It is part of the charm! If you want kettles and toasters and all things english then why go to greece? The Natalie apartments are ideally situated right near to the beach, which yes is used at night to drive on but only about 50/80 yards, the rest of the beach is beautiful, infact part of it is the turtle reserve, you just have to walk a little further along, although the first part is cleaned and made ready for sun beds early in the morning. Most apartments in greece do not have shower curtains neither is their plumbing famous! (if you are lucky enough to get a shower curtain then thats a bonus) but if you love the food, the charm of the people, the laid back lifestyle and the warm welcome that you receive everywhere you go then you will love it. We found the apartments to be clean, basic and everything we had expected for our money, indeed we have been back twice.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SussexSmiths", "date": "February 6, 2007", "id": 6750563}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "Myself and two friends stayed at the Natalie in this year and although it wasn't luxurious, it isn't a five star hotel so that's not what we were expecting. The owners of the are very friendly and welcoming and the apartments are in close promximity to the lively nightlife of Laganas. The rooms are pretty basic, but then that's what you come to expect in Greece. The fact that the shower didn't have a curtain or hook is certainly not unusual for a Greek island!! Our room was clean and the towels/bins were emptied regularly, other than that we didn't spend much time in them so they served their purpose! There are some decent restaurants along the sea front, Med Version is perhaps the nicest. If you are looking for something more traditionally Greek the you may need to travel a bit further afield. Was looking forward to the trip to Kefalonia to see \"Captain Correli's Island!\" but I have to say most of this day was either spent on the bus or the boat so be careful which trip you book!", "title": "Basic, friendly hotel, ideal location", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "jojo21", "date": "December 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4252661}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Oct 16-23 2005", "text": "I don't think i'd recommend this hotel for families in the peak season as Laganas is full of youngsters wanting to party, not that this hotel is the equivalent of a club 18-30 hotel because it isn't.
