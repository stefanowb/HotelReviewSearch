The rooms have become so dingy and tired. We were on the 3 floor with a balcony. The balcony is very dirty with two dirty tied single chairs. So dirty that we had to put towels on them to sit on them. The refrigerator door was barely hanging on. The room is on it's last legs. We looked in the \"remodelled\" rooms on the 1st floor that have laminate flooring and a new TV....but you could clearly hear the people above. So we picked the 3rd floor old rooms with no one above. The breakfast is cooked to order with two cooks. The one guy is like the soup Nazi from the Sienfield show. They have a few choices but don't try and get it different....OMG.....really. I wanted no potatoes but wanted yogurt....so in the end he made me have the potatoes and unhappily gave me the yogurt. They hide the fruit. And when the jam runs out .... that's it they don't refill them. Again, really? They told us that they are working to upgrade their status rating but adding some features but really it should be going down on the rating scale.", "title": "Very Tired", "user": "azahunting", "date": "February 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 125296850}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012", "text": "After a day of golf, we checked in so we could shower before dinner and there was no hot water.

This hotel is on highway 111, the main drag through all of the towns comprising Palm Springs. It is central and close to malls, theatres, and most of the golf courses (Indian Wells was 2 minutes away, La Quinta about a 15-20 minute drive). Unfortunately I found the room to be fairly average to oldish - with a very strong smell of cleaning product that greeted us when we entered. The safe was not reset and the room wasn't serviced/cleaned until the late afternoon, which was a bit annoying to return to on our second day there.
