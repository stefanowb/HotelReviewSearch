The taxi driver must have taken us through the most unscenic roads with neighborhoods that looked poverty stricken. When we reached the Hilton it was more of the same. The Southern coastline seemed to have a lot of poverty. We found out quickly that there is one other hotel nearby and only one other restaurant. We felt like we were stranded with eating expensive food at hotel. Our first night the staff recommended St Lawrence Gap for dinner. We had to walk about 4 deserted blocks to main road in order to take buses. We were not impressed w/ St Lawrence Gap. It was an older town with 2 blocks of overpriced restaurants that were completely deserted. We ate at Ships Inn restaurant there and had tasteless fish for cost of about $75. We decided to go to nearby shopping centers that were on road to St Lawrence for our future dinners and once went to Oistens Fish Fry. We ate breakfast at hotel because it was priced better than other meals, had an occasional sandwich for lunch there which is about $18 each, and dinner one night which food was not worth the money.", "title": "Great stay with some minor negatives", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Daniel_Lon", "date": "December 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 90333480}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in room 323 which had an excellent, gorgeous view of the beach.
