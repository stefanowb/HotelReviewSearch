Olympic Park, Stanley Seawall, Convention Center, etc. Very reasonably priced. Despite of it being a business hotel, it had a cozy feel of it being great for families as well. We were fortunately billeted at a corner room w/ good views of the harbor and the staff was most hospitable and helpful in more ways than one! Wanted to give special mention to Mr. Romy Herrera, the hotel comptroller who was quite welcoming and accomodating! Gave us a good insight on Vancouver and the highlights to see as seen by a local. Also, the people at the Front Desk and 2 concierge personnel named Ken, (i think) who was doing our valet parking for us. Always ready to give us personalized suggestions as how we made the most of our 3 day-2 night stay in the city. Amazing how in that span of time, we were able to do a quick bike ride along Stanley Park Seawall, have a quick visit to the beaches, go to Capilano Suspension Bridge, Kitsilano Beach and the Granville Islands and sample the best seafood a harbour city like Vancouver can offer. The hotel restaurant/bar was likewise an outlet to try. The food was exemplary and quite decently priced, with impressive service staff. If one is travelling on business, one can easily unwind in the very clean and well maintained gym, hot tub and pool. All in all, a great hotel to stay in. So, if you are looking for a hotel with the luxury feel to it, w/ personalized service and yet have that homey feel which a family can likewise enjoy, be it on business or pleasure, this is the hotel we totally suggest you look into!

Centrally located a couple blocks from Robson Street where there are lots of restaurants and shopping. About an 8 minute walk to Stanley Park. Two minute walk to the Seawall and more restaurant options. A nice market/cafe right across the street. Seven 11 located at the back entrance for Scotia bank ATM and/or easy purchases. A drug store located across the street. About 10 minute walk to the Skylink system that brings you to the Vancouver Airport for $4 a person one way. We didn't bring a car, so used the public trans system and have no complaints. It was easy to use and the hotel was within close range to everything we needed and everywhere we went. We used the pool a couple of times and no complaints. Nice fitness center with quality machines. I would definely stay here again.

We genuinely felt that each staff member wanted us to enjoy our stay. This time, we left clothes in the dresser and didn't realize it until we were back in the states. We called housekeeping who were very willing to help with our plight. Traditionally, they ship things to guests via postal service. We asked that they ship Fed Ex using our own account number. I could tell this was not something that had been asked of the head of housekeeping before, but she was extremely willing to ship it \"our way\" and got the necessary information and was only too glad to accommodate our request. When traveling, there are always inherent problems, delays, and mishaps, so when you stay at a hotel where the staff is genuinely trying to make things easier for you, it really makes a difference.

We arrived and were asked about our trip up to this point( which had been a nightmare). They upgraded our room for us and our check in was handled so effortlessly. Each time that we entered the lobby, it didn't matter who was at the front desk, they acknowledged us and asked how our day was. My son rode his bike to visit us and the concierge graciously checked it for him. One night my sister noticed a spot on her comforter and called guest services. The manager called us immediately with an apology and housekeeping was there in about 3 min. While he was changing the duvet cover there was another knock at the door and the manager had sent up a bottle of wine with a written apology. We were blown away.The staff here should give other hotels lessons in customer service as it has become a lost art. I plan on visiting again in the near future and will definitely make the Coast Coal Harbour my home base.

She even got a map out and showed us a number of sites,restaurants and shops close by.Our sister who lives in Vancouver spent the 1st nite with us and was brought in a cot (which was actually a real bed all made up) at the time we requested! We had a corner room with a beautiful view of the water between the surrounding tall buildings, a surprise and thrill for all of us! The bed was super comfy and the bathroom had a lovely deep soaker tub and bath products that were absolutely amazing.My sister and I both have very sensitive skin AND NO REACTIONS!!!!The maids also were fantastic and when we asked for more coffee for the in room coffee maker gave us 2 extra, yay! Oh 1 more cool thing the bathroom had a timed heat lamp which I turned on for extra light while putting on my makeup. The only negative was the small closet, so we just didn't unpack.

There are many, many places in the neighborhood for dining and libations, and all of DT Vancouver is readily available by walking. And, the hotel is located only 2 blocks from the Skytrain station for the airport connection. The rooms are smartly decorated and well-appointed. The bathroom was large and robes were provided.
