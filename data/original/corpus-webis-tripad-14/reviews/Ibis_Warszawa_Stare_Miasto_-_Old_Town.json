There is a bus/tram stop right outside the hotel and if you buy a pass you can zap around the city without any difficulty. Very impressed with Warsaw. Very clean city saw no litter whatsoever. The people are friendly and they live with the snow - life carries on as normal with every road/footpath being clear.

As it turns out there really aren't many properties in the Old Town proper but this hotel is located a leisurely fifteen minutes away by foot and is a great property. It is relatively new, very modern and kept up very well. While our room was compact it was well designed, the bath was very comfortable and most importantly, the room was quiet and clean. The service at the front desk was terrific and we certainly felt as if we were in a very upscale property despite the low price.
