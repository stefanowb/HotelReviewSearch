There were 2 TVs though the picture on English channel was very poor. The rooms were very clean with an endless supply of clean towels each day. We were given beach towels and these too were exchanged after 3 days. The food in the hotel was excellent with a good choice for all our family. Pasta, pizza, daily roast, lots of fish dishes - even lobster - and loads of fresh fruit, vegetables and salad. The kids club was superb and our 6 year old loved it. Our eldest went scuba diving every day and was picked up by bus from the hotel. Not too much else for teenagers around the hotel though. The entertainment in the hotel was usually good and occasionally only average. The only slight complaint was the noise from the room above us when they woke in the morning.

There was always some atmosphere in the evenings, enough people around. The children's playground was small but fine. The reception staff did their best to help. But our villa was only cleaned once in two weeks, which is shocking, really poor service for what we paid, that was really disappointing. But the amenities in the villa were good, the aircon worked, the outside seating area was nice. Definitely 4 star though, not 5 star. But it's a 4 star hotel, do there you go.

And we loved the town on La Maddelenna island, it's really pretty (unlike a lot of the other towns there). We had lunch there a few times, it's an easy 15 minute ferry trip from Palau. San Pantaleo village (in the hills) was nice to visit for a morning as well. La Risacca restaurant, just around the corner from the hotel, is amazing.

Our room i think was a junior suite and was lovely, very roomy. The food in the hotel was great, i don`t think i have ever eaten so much. You really could eat as much as you want and at the start we went a bit mad but by end of the week, we were so full we could hardly eat anything. Location of the hotel is good as you can have a wee wander to the town. We hired a car as it was so wet and we found that really expensive so if you want to hire a car book this in the UK before you go.
