We had booked a Garden Suite but were upgraded upon arrival to the Garden Pool Suite with a view of Borobudur in the distance. Our private pool and cabana were a highlight of our trip throughout Thailand and Indonesia. We also had a deep marble tub for two in our private garden! You cannot imagine the quality of everything in this hotel. From the moment we were met on the tarmac, escorted to a VIP lounge and served pastries and cappuccino while someone from the hotel waited for our baggage and tagged it with leather luggage tags, we were treated like very important guests. After check-in we were escorted to our room and our luggage was already placed in separate dressing areas for him and her with the appropriate small sized slippers, make-up mirror and robe for her! There are even straw hats and bags for your use that you can take home as a souvenir. Now for the caution...the price! A small 6 oz.glass of a non-alcoholic ginger beer was approximately $15 US and most of that was ice! Their signature soursop martini was approximately $30, for one! A glass of orange juice is about $10. The dawn tour of Borobudur for two will cost about $200. If cost is not an issue then by all means book the tours, order in room service, go to the spa.
