We ended up checking out one night earlier as I was afraid for my baby to catch some disease from that carpet which probably has not seen vacuum since the time hotel was built.. If you can't afford a little bit more then I guess nothing you can do. However I bet by doing a little bit of research on available deals you could get better for same money. Kids enjoyed the pool but at end my daughter was having itchy eyes, I suspect from the pools \u2018water with too much chlorine as it does not seem to get changed. Staffs are very friendly though.
