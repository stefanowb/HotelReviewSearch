Although on Fiji time anything we asked for we got and received a phone call after to confirm that we had received it ( for example a missing glass, ice bucket, milk for fridge). The rooms were spotless I am a clean freak especially bathrooms and it got the nod. everyday they clean the room and make up the beds etc., the resort is lovely attached to the original sheraton which is old and tired. unfortunately we had 5 out of 7 days of rain it was the week after the cyclone hit, even the locals couldn't believe the rain! so as it was our first time we didn't get to go on any island trips i would not recommend to go at this time of year (February) we will not go again then. The bonus was that you have other resorts close by that you can go and visit and the free bulla bus was a godsend in the rain it was so heavy walking was not really an option. Still after comparing other resorts we thought that we had chosen the best and most of the action is at the Westin which was right next door. the only other resort i would consider staying at would be the radisson but i still think the villas are better . I had considered staying at the coral coast and we hired a local taxi man for the day to take us there, we visited the shangri la fijian resort it is out on its own and well kept but looking a little old I was so happy that we chose Denarau as at least you could do more things rather than being stuck at one resort especially if the weather is bad. The coral coast resorts are all spread out and are not together like where we stayed about a 2 hour drive from denarau.", "title": "loved the sheraton villas and denarau", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "fordy", "date": "March 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14057845, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 central to other resorts for dining and leisure options", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled on business", "text": "i am glad we got to see fiji not at the best time but in comparison i would go back to vanuatu before i would go to fiji again.", "title": "Friendly Fiji", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "AucklandMacs", "date": "January 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12345198, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 pool complex/help with baby", "disliked": "\u2014 food cost at restaurants"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2005, traveled as a couple", "text": "restaurants the westin- steakhouse and the terrace.

The Sheraton Villas are very Sterile and Westernised in facilities and appearance. This is great if you want a holiday in the Sun with all the mod cons of home, but as a representation of Fiji it does not come close. If your are looking for Tropical Beaches then forget this as well, Denarau is surrounded by muddy beaches & water and the island exists solely for the large resorts and smaller residential enclaves. As the Sheraton is closed, you get to eat at the Westin next door. Breakfasts are included in the price which is full buffet, but the drinks at the Bars and dinners are outrageously expensive. My advice is to eat at the Golf club acros the road, or take the shuttle to the Marina where you have a choice of restauarnts.", "title": "Sterile & Not The Real Fiji", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Biddleonia", "date": "May 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16378931}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "One final thing, the main pool tempertaure was icey cold, not great in a tropical climate.", "title": "dont forget your wallet", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "golflink", "date": "April 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 15118417, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 variety of pools", "disliked": "\u2014 very expensive for food/drinks"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My advice is stay on an island, you get closer to the staff and get to experience something closer to the real Fiji.", "title": "Wonderful time", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Swimmer_7", "date": "April 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14901053}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We loved the accomodation and the pools.
