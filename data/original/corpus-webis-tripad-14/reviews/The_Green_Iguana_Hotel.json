It\u2019s located right next to Blackbeard\u2019s Castle, and is a five-minute walk (via the 99 stairs) from the Charlotte Amalie shopping district. My room (H-2) was small but just fine. After a week in non-air-conditioned Tortola, it was a pleasure to stay for a night in a cool room with dish TV and a modern bathroom. My room had a little refrigerator, microwave, toaster oven, and coffee maker. My deck had a wonderful view of part of the city and of the hills above the Green Iguana. The only negative regarding the Green Iguana is that its management seems big on rules and is not very flexible. For example, my request to check out an hour late (noon instead of 11 a.m.) was denied \u2013 the first time that has happened to me in more than 30 years of extensive travel. Also, you are given a code that opens the front entrance, and if you forget the code and it\u2019s after 8 p.m., there is no one to call and you have to spend the night outside, I was told by the folks who run the place. Again, that seems a bit inflexible to me. While I realize there are good reasons for establishing checkout times (the rooms need to be cleaned for subsequent lodgers) and asking customers to remember an entrance code (the property managers have a life too, and don\u2019t want to be bothered by late-night travelers who have locked themselves out), part of me thinks that, hey, they\u2019re in the lodging business and being inconvenienced by a customer once in a while comes with the territory.", "title": "Nice room", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "iraform", "date": "December 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6438511}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Still, I was very pleased with my stay at the Green Iguana, and I found it to be a clean, well-located place to stay at a fair price.", "title": "Great Hote & Great View!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Maya7", "date": "December 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 6354350}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Convenient and welcoming", "text": "The Green Iguana was able to accomodate us on a last minutes notice.

We were very happy with the overall cleanliness and look of the room. There was a slight ant problem in the bathroom but they leave bug spray under the sink so I just sprayed around the cracks the ants were getting through and that pretty much solved the problem. It wasn't major enough to make me feel the place was dirty, I figured it was just part of being in the location they were in. The view from our room was nice, part of it was of the town and the other was of the water/island. My only issue was with the house keeping, the women came by my room around 10am to ask if we needed anything and we said no, not at the moment and I guess to her this meant we didn't need the room changed over. We figured when we left she would have came back and did the routine change over but when we returned to our room that evening nothing was changed.
