At first the staff seemed friendly. However don't stay at this hotel! Bad location where noise of the city and street thugs are everywhere around outside. Felt very threatened. Returning back to hotel after going out with a local friend in Naples, we came back after midnight to have some wine in our room. The front lobby doors were locked. The midnight manager 'on duty' was sleeping and we were pounding on the door for 5 minutes until we woke him. Talk about being locked out of your own hotel! Upon opening the door with a dirty look for having woke him up while \"on duty\" he emphatically said that our friend could not visit with us in the room because things appeared \"immoral\" for the city code, ,etc with there being only 2 beds. This neanderthal, barbaric mentaliy in Naples is so hypocritical to the way of life in which the local people live it's disgusting! In addition, the air conditioning did not work, The room was extremely hot and humid during our stay and breakfast was tropical hawaiian punch for juice with store bought crackers and cheap pastries. I would say this is a place if you're traveling alone and only want to pay 40 Euros a night. However, it's more than that and certainly not worth it! Stay elsewhere, closer to the port near the cruise ships. Do not stay at San Pietro. After explaining the situation to the other manager on duty with hopes that they would even be concerned that their night shift employee sleeps on the job, they justified it by saying \"You didn't have to wait more than a few minutes out side I'm sure\" Such arrogance.

The hotel was very very clean and the maid service was exceptional. Breakfast isnt very grand but considering what Italy offers as a breakfast we were satisfied.
