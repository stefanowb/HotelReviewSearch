The staff did what they could and perhaps this was isolated, but at any rate an issue.

We arrived April 15 and stayed tell April 17, room 303. When we arrived at the hotel, Sheila booked us in. I told her it was a get away for the hubbys birthday, so she upgraded us for free to a suite. This suite had 2 rooms plus the bathroom ( it was bigger then my brother-in-laws whole apartment in Dublin!) There was the bedroom that had a large bed, table and tv, desk and wardrobe. Then there is a connecting door that went into a large room that had 2 couches, tv and then on the other end of the sitting room there is a large table to seat 4/6 people, a kitchen area that has a microwave, kettle, fridge/freezer, sink and toaster and all the dishes. I run my own cleaning company and I have to give credit where credit is due to Yvonna, the housekeeper, I could honestly find NO FAULT in the cleaning department in this whole motel and believe me, I was searching for a cobweb but found none. I also want to say a big thanks to Helen the young lady that gladly gave us some shampoo for the AWESOME power shower (as I left home with out the shampoo.) There are tea/coffee facilities in the main lobby that are always full and hot and we had wifi in our room. I can honestly say as we travel all over Ireland and the world, this has to be one of the nicest and one of the cleanest places that we have stayed in in a long time. If it wasn't for the fact that it is a 5 hour drive each way, we would make it a regular stop on our list. The room came with breakfast and there is a great selection of cereals, breads and fruit and then the hot meal to go with it, so if you leave hungry here, it is your own fault. They even heat the plates for the hot breakie, don't find that in many places anymore. Monday night weather was gail force winds and rain and bright and early the next am, there were no signs of the tree limbs and mess in the parking lot from the storm, the grounds had already been cleaned up.
