New hotels are certainly making more of an effort these days to be more green and that is really great. I can only guess that this effort to be more green (by saving water) is what the issue was with the sink faucet in our room. Basically the water came out in a similar fashion as it does at some airports/restaurants....in a delicate, spray/shower like way that made rinsing soap off difficult. The water saving aspects are lost when guests are forced to wait around to collect enough water for a really long time to wash the suds off their hands or to wet their face.

They clearly are trying to create a \"different\" experience, and I personally enjoyed it. Very modern, hip, and clearly geared toward a younger crowd. I stayed for two nights while visiting my company's Waltham office. It's a little tricky to find, as it is tucked behind a mountain, but it is very conveniently located near the highway. The lobby area is a large, open space, with a bar/lounge, and a food/snack area in the corner. It's a very social environment, with semi-loud pop music playing throughout the main areas and elevators. The front desk is more like a retail checkout counter, right in the middle of the room. While I arrived late the first night (after the bar had closed), on the second evening the lounge was very popular, with probably 20+ people in the bar, pool table, and lounge areas. The food/snack area was well stocked with grab and go items, and offered a pretty decent cooked to order breakfast menu (not free though). There is no traditional restaurant. The modern styled room wasn't all that large, but offered a nice comfortable platform bed, a desk looking out the window with a cool device to hook your electronics into the large flat screen TV, and a unique closet / divider between the main room and bathroom. The large windows were great for natural light / views, but also had good blackout shades for sleeping. They included a free bottle of water each day, and there is a small fridge, but no microwave. My only complaints were no iron & ironing board in the room (had to request from the front desk), and the doors to the rooms don't have adequate dampers, so they \"slam\" loudly when guests let them close by themselves at all hours of the day and night. Overall, I appreciated the unique experience, and will gladly return to stay on my next business trip to the area.", "title": "Fun, hip, modern take on the typical hotel experience", "user": "Nathan S", "date": "May 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 159459216}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel had a great vibe to it.
