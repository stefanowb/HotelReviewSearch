What a delight ! Room was to a very high standard - modern and well equipped - although the remote control for the lighting did fox us at first - and was a bit tricky to find and operate in the middle of the night ! The Reception service and meal were very good and everything went very smoothly. All the dining room and bar area are very attractive - and the light fittings in particular are amazing. There is obviously a project to build some more outside at the back - but the gardens were very pleasant and well manicured. A lovely comfortable place and everyone felt very relaxed and looked after. Breakfast the next morning was good and despite a bit of fun with a reluctant card machine the checkout was pleasant and smooth.

That was my introduction to this place. Room is well decorated, badly equipped, no tea/coffee making facility, for example. Phone is on desk out of reach of the bed, making responding to morning alarm call difficult. Lighting is controlled by complex remote control -- no switches -- impossible to fathom out. TV made up for the porn by having many of its pitiably small choice of channels (among them a mere two radio channels) providing \"snowflake\" infested pictures -- and in any case the sound did not work (apart from a 2-minute burst).

Breakfast was a disaster. A lacklustre help-yourself display of cereals, breads, cheese and hams, a near-empty jug of orange juice that was never replenished once it had been emptied. No menu for the cooked breakfast, but an assurance that they could do anything. Not the requested kipper, they couldn't. Smoked haddock was claimed to be available, but what was served -- swimming in a sea of water -- was both tough and tasteless and bore no resemblance to smoked haddock. Inedible. The accompanying requested poached egg had been overcooked. White toast was asked for; two slices of slightly warmed (yes really!) white bread were served and sent back to be re-toasted.

I wanted to start my day with a visit to the gym and spa, but was told that neither would be open for the foreseeable future. This struck me as odd considering the hotel claims it is a \"Hotel & Spa\". While a bit confusing, it wasn't a deal-breaker. The next morning the hotel experienced some sort of power issue as there was no hot water and my traveling companion lost all power to his room. Again, I tried to be optimistic - a cold shower is an invigorating way to start the day, right? I was dismayed, however, when my complaints to the manager were met with chuckles and half-hearted apologies. No adjustment was made to my bill, no offers of any kind were made. I spent the rest of my visit in a hotel in Liverpool.
