The house is a typical colonial New England house. It has been lovingly restored and maintained with beautiful antiques. Our room had a private bath with tub/shower. Ted, the innkeeper, shows his love for this place in all the little details of the house. There is even a small little garden in front with a gazebo and a koi pond. The best feature is the full American breakfast included in the room rate. Breakfast is served in the dining room which even has the original beehive antique oven. Ted used to manage a restaurant before and he is quite the gourmet chef. He gets up every morning at 5 a.m. to prepare breakfast. He prepares the most wonderful fruit breads which are served warm. The two mornings that we were there we had cranberry and banana nut bread. You also get a choice of eggs prepared any way you'd like with home fries and fruit. Or, you can request an omelette with a choice of ingredients. Other guests there raved about the fresh fruit pancakes. Everything is made fresh and delicious! Ted is a friendly and gracious host who offered many suggestions for things to do and offered help with dinner reservations and even a whalewatching reservation in Provincetown.
