We stayed in a quiet, spacious room (the Villa) together with our 2 year old son. Very helpful staff who sometimes still have to find their way (how to make a Bloody Mary?), but at your service immediately and of good spirit. Breakfast is nice and the restaurant serves some good and authentic Cambodian dishes for diner. The pool is small, clean and refreshing after visiting the temples of Ankor Wat.
