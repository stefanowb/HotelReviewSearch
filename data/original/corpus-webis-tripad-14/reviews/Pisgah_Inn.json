The view is completely uninterrupted from the rooms - and it looks like it has for millions of years - you do not see any developments or cars - just pure mountains. We stayed in the Treetops building which has been refurbished and updated. Comfortable beds and very clean. The wooden rockers on the balcony were brand new and clean. Only thing I saw in the other rooms that I wish our room had was a small table and chairs inside so you could sit and watch the view. I think the older rooms have that so it is a trade off.

Please cut the owners, management and staff a little slack. They were ordered by the government to close down due to the \"shut down\" and they had just a few days to get everyone out and cancel all reservations at what it usually a peak time of year when these private mom and pop places in the mountains make all there money for the year.

You can't get that in very many places with a view like that. The owner of the property served our coffee the next morning in the restaurant. The restaurant deserves our heartfelt praise. They could get by with third rate food and high prices, but the food is excellent and the prices very reasonable. You can order top line entrees for $ 30.00 or so, but they also have meat loaf and chicken pot pie for much less. Wine is expensive, but you can drink ice tea.

On our second trip, we stopped in to investigate the price and amenities. With the view from the mountain, we were expecting the place to be completely booked a year in advance and to be way out of our price range. We were shocked that there was an opening for the following evening and that the price (comparable to what we spend at generic hotels across the country) included a hot breakfast at the attached restaurant. We immediately decided to extend our vacation another day just to stay on this property. The second floor room had two queen beds, mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. We, of course, spent the majority of our time on the porch. It was 62 degrees on the evening we stayed (mid-July) and the breeze was fabulous. It felt safe to leave our door open for the cross breeze until we went to bed. Air-conditioning is completely unnecessary! The room was clean and comfortable. Our neighbors on both sides were quiet (which was a big bonus because you can hear every word spoken on the balconies.) We slept well and woke up refreshed and ready for breakfast. We arrived first with the goal of getting a table by the window (which worked) and it was totally worth it. We watched hummingbirds flying around against the backdrop of the mountains while we were eating. Awesome! Breakfast included veggie sausage options - weren't expecting that!! After we ate, we walked along the property and saw 12 hummingbirds and several chipmunks.
