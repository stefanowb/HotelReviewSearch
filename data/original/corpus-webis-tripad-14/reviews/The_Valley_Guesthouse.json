We have stayed twice at this up-scale guest house and highly recommend it. We had the penthouse room last time - with a roof level deck and looked right across at the Buddha eyes on the famous stupa close by. It is spotlessly clean, with western-style bathrooms - a very big deal in that country. The rooms are nicely decorated and comfortable. It's more like a small hotel than a guest house - although they don't have a restaurant there but will recommend the best places to eat nearby. The owners are Nepali and Tibetan and speak excellent English. They are very helpful and soon we felt like, and were treated like, family.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 8, 2004", "id": 2812452}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We ended up staying at The Valley Guest House after not being able to book a room at the Shechen Guest House.

It is in a convenient location only minutes away from the Stupa (to the North) in Bodhnath. We had a large room, with a three-piece suite, two double beds and a balcony with a view of the Stupa. The room was comfortable and whilst the bathroom was clean with western flushing toilets it was outside the room itself in the corridor, although still en-suite as a curtain had been erected around the room door and the bathroom door. It looks a bit odd at first, but it didn\u2019t really detract from our stay here.

The staff were polite and room / roof service was efficient, but I have found staff friendlier in other hotels / guest houses we stayed in around Nepal, which surprised us given the reviews on TripAdvisor.
