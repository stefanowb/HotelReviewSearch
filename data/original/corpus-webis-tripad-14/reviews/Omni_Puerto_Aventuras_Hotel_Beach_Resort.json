We bid on the vacation through an internet site, therefore we weren't sure what to expect. We were very pleasantly surprised. The small size of the hotel was an enjoyable alternative to the large resorts of Cancun. The staff are professional, friendly, and accomodating...we asked to have a romantic dinner, the chef personally came to us on the beach one afternoon to ask what we would like him to prepare. The restaurant staff set up a table on the beach, surrounded by tiki torches, and served us an amazing meal.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "MEPM", "date": "February 10, 2005", "id": 3177821}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wow!!! What a great place", "text": "We just returned from a stay at the Omni. After reading some of the reviews we were not sure we would like this hotel. Boy, were we wrong. This place was incredible!! Where should we start\u2014well how about the beautiful, open-air lobby. It was decorated with great furniture and local art pieces. Because we were there near Christmas, they had the lobby tastefully decorated and it was filled with the smell of fresh evergreens. Judging from the lobby, it would appear that this is a huge resort, but it is only 30 rooms.", "helpfulness": 37, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 21, 2004", "id": 2907172}], "location": {}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 16, "very good": 84, "terrible": 15, "excellent": 158}, "aka": "Omni Puerto Aventuras Hotel Beach Puerto Aventuras", "slim_ranking": 0.1875, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}}
