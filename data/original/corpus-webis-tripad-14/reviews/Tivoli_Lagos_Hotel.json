From the exterior the hotel looks extremely modern as is the lobby and bar areas but unfortunately the rooms are very old and dirty and do not live up to the standard of the Tivoli group of hotels. On arrival at the hotel the receptionist gave us our room number and the porter took our bags and we went with him with our push chair and all the excess of having a baby. They put us into a room which was down 2 flights of stairs and then a further 2 lift jouneys!!!. This was definately not suitable for a family with a pushchair and then we asked to moved which we was. It is a shame that the receptionist did not think prior to where they should put us as a family. The location of the hotel is great and within 5 minutes walk of the old town center and marina.

The staff were lovely and very helpful. The breakfasts were nice and plentiful The indoor pool was a Godsend as it rained the whole week. We were a bit disappointed that the gym wasnt included and was charged as an extra. The free internet is a nice touch and useful for staying in touch with home. The location is brill, just a few minutes walk into town. Happy hour at the hotel still seemed expensive and we found it was cheaper at Lius bar across the road. All in all we were well happy with our stay at the Tivoli. Look out for Tivoli the cat, hes the best fed cat in Lagos.

Main lounge areas cool and comfortable. Location was excellent with bus station and train station very close. It was only a short stroll to the prom and Old Lagos .Spoiled for choice eating out ,but I would reccomend O Algarvia across the road from the hotel with O Artista nearby coming second . We tried others but kept coming back to O Algarvia . Evening entertainment on the two nights we saw it was a trad jazz band,very good and an Elvis tribute singer who had the place jumping !
