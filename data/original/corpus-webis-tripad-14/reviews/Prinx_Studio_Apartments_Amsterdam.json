Needless to say, location, styling, privacy, communication with the owners - are the most ideal aspects of the studios. Impeccably clean, well serviced and comfortable beds in a spacious and historic home on a canal in Amsterdam -what more could you ask! But seriously, if you are a new ex-pat waiting to settle this is a great location. For all, transit proximity is ideal in any direction - you are only one block away from the 10, the ring tram that takes you to the Heinikein, the Albert Cuyp, the Botanical Gardens, to name a few. The Leidsplein is within walking distance, as are endless club, restaurants and shopping. You are safe and secure, knowing any problem can be managed with accessible onsite owners.

Close to everything, but still relatively quite (keep in mind you are in Amsterdam and there are lots of late night happenings). The Prinx is very convenient to several tram routes.
