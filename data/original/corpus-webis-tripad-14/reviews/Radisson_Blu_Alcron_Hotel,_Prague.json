Air conditioning was barely adequate, but I'm used to the strong A/C we have in New York, so overall we found most air conditioning in Europe to be not quite up to par.

The breakfast was fantastic everything you need. We had a meal at the alron which was excellent aswell. We also liked the beboop bar with jazz playing in the background. I thought it was a good idea that the hotel car takes you back to the airport.

There is plenty to do, this ranges from shopping,excursions and more shopping. There is plenty of restaurants to choose from, there is a irish pub right next door to the hotel, which was really nice especially if you like sport because they show all the footie games. We didnt eat in the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. Prague is like a mini London, if you have been there. There are a couple of clubs & bars, but you just need to find them because they are not situated together. The hotel room was lovely, we were on the 8th floor so we got quite a nice view from our room, I liked the fact that there was music in the bathroom I thought that was different.There was also a mini bar, flat screen plasma TV, cofee making facilites and a lovely comfortable king size bed. I have also got to say that the maids were brill, they cleaned our room every day and that you should visit Charles Bridge which is about a 10 mins walk and you will see some lovely scenery this is a must do!. I would def stay at this hotel again, thanks Raddison for a brilliant stay!!! I hope this will help you on by choosing this hotel, you will not be disappointed.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Swanny86", "date": "September 4, 2008", "id": 19767014}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006", "text": "Sarah", "title": "Incredible Hotel in an equally incredible city!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JonnyC531", "date": "September 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19763450, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quality, Location, Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing...A+ across the board"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "London", "title": "Fantastic service!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Nanami54", "date": "September 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19675154, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Upon arriving in the Czech Republic from a four day bender at the Radisson SAS in Amsterdam, we were very excited to take in the beautiful sights of Prague in the summertime.", "title": "Top Notch and just off Wencelas Square", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Baxie", "date": "August 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19248345, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Upgrade"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We emailed the concierge a week before our arrival to arrange transport from the airport (at a nominal fee) and had a brand new mercedes waiting for us once we checked out bags.
