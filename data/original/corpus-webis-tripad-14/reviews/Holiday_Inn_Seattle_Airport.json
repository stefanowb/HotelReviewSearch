The location is great, you can walk to the hotel from the airport which saves a lot of hassle with courtesy coaches. The rooms are a decent size and technically clean but they look grubby. Glad I only had a day rate room and didn't actually stay the night. The pool is cold, actually cold and there is no changing room or showers ?? I had to change round the corner by the jacuzzi which was over chlorinated and my eyes were burning.

Some of the reviews I had read did not give me much hope after I won this room on priceline.com.

I have recently been staying at hotels near the airport and taking the light rail back and forth to the games.
