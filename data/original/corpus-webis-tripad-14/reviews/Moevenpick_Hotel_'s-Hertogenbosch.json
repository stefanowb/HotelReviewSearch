My SatNav easily got me from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam to within a few hundred metres of the hotel. But then the frustration set in. There were no signs, that I could see, to the hotel from the main road, Gestelsweg. In fact, even the map on the right here has palce the hotel in the wrong place!
