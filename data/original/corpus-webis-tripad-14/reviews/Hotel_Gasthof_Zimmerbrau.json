The hotel has recently been very tastefully redecorated and our room was so spacious, it was one of the best we have ever stayed in! The buffet breakfast always has a wide range of choices as does the four course evening meal, it is excellent value. The hotel is situated in the middle of the town and there is always something going on, Saturdays and Wednesdays there is a band concert in the square which creates a wonderful atmosphere. The scenery all round is breathtaking, there is certainly something for all ages in the area. We certainly hope to go back again one day.

It was very clean and homely, the owners were very friendly and were able to advise us about where to go etc. The food was nice, always hot and a good variety even serving free tea / coffee with your evening ,eal which was nice. If you are a light sleeper though ask for a room away from the front or back of the hotel as the local church has it bells peeling all through the night every hour and then every 15 minutes from about 6AM. The resort itself is VERY quiet over New Year. Once the little advent huts have been taken down which is usually on New Years day the only shops that seemed to be open were the 2 small supermarkets. New Years Eve itself was dissappointing with a few people gathered in the main square but maybe this is because it is a bank holiday and many of the locals do go away. New Years day and 6th Jan are both bank holidays there and literally nothing is open, the buses do still run though but even the bigger resorts like Bad Ischl are completley closed, i would recommend maybe going up to the Postalm on these days just for something to do. If you like walking then there are lots of walks to do and the scenery is stunning. The people are very friendly and there are a few nice local bars that open late. Overall it was a great holiday and very relaxing but just be prepared if its a bank holiday expecially at catholic relgious times for the small resort to be shut down.", "title": "great hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Jops", "date": "January 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6564335, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean & Friendly", "disliked": "\u2014 the local church being so close with its bells chiming all night"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a brilliant little hotel which deserves more than its three star rating.

The only thing the rain spoiled was the cog railway that takes you up one of the mountains - it was rain on the ground but snow at the top so the train could not operate. However, going when there was still snow on the top of the mountains did make the scenery more spectacular.
