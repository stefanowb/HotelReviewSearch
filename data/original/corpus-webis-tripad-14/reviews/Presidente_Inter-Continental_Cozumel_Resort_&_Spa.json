I thought it was beautiful. SO relaxing!! Did some diving and enjoyed myself, saw eels, rays, squid, lobster, many fish, and the water was SO nice and warm. My hubby and I where looking for a resort to unwind from our busy work lives at home, and this did the trick. It was so quiet, no phones, pagers, traffic... The resort had a certain calmness to it. Hard to find. The food was really good at the restaurant on the property. We ate there quite a bit. Happy hour from 5-7 daily. Watched the sunset every night at happy hour. Will miss the presidente, the wonderful blue water, and the laid back, casual lifestyle.

There are no sales people trying to hype the place as a time share, no pressure tactics to tour and buy, no \"give away\" deals that come with fine print obligations. It offers comfortable accommodations with some elegance. The location is private and quiet. The buildings are stylish and attractive. The beaches are well maintained and offer a range of lounging choices. The pool is large. The snorkeling, right off the beach, is fantastic. If all you did every day was hang out right there, you'd have a first-class Cozumel experience. It's a taxi ride anywhere if you don't rent a car, but you'll want to sightsee more of the island, trying local cuisine, shopping, and seeing the wide open stretches of water and sand on the east side. (We recommend the funky, friendly bar at Chen Rio for cervezas on a hot afternoon). Forget the all-inclusives on Cozumel.

Sound insulation in our room was poor; could hear our neighbors coming in and out at night. Maid service was uneven; only once did we get turn down service and soiled dishes were not removed for several days. We had one big rain with lots of wind and water poured into our room through the patio door. While breakfast were satisfactory, the food at the main outdoor restaurant was mediocre at best - mostly gummy steam table fare at unreasonably high prices. The hotel's towel policy was demanding despite our paying the resot surcharge - if you failed to return the towel card or the towel on checking out you would be charged $45 per towel; I felt put upon wrangling the towels of two adults and two kids during my stay so as to avoid the fine. The exercise room is teeny with a waiting line (and pretty poor equipment). Scuba Du - the inhouse dive shop - appeared to regularly overcharge by converting rates from pesos to dollars back to pesos at different rates (so the 10 peso daily national park fee was converted into $1 and then we were charged 12 pesos because that was the rate used at that stage). The only redeeming part of this hotel is the location which abuts great waters for snorkeling. Front desk service was also nothing to right home about; by phone from the US they could not confirm whether TelCel - a local cellular phone service allied with Cingular - worked on the hotel grounds (it does) and they steered hotel guests to an overpriced restaurant (the diners mostly seemed to be fellow hotel guests) in twon whose seafood was not fresh and whose service was surly (apparently some sort of referral sysyetm was going on which did not reflect well on the hotel's integrity).

The restaurant is great and has the same or better quality than most for food, but the view is truly amazing at this hotel so I recommend dinning here. Also the breakfast, lunch & dinning is very resonable in price and consider the savings of not messing with a taxi + tip. We found out that the taxi fares are not $5.00 but varied more like $15.00-$20.00 for family of four to dine out and the other restaurants did not have a nice ambiance nor view and food was not better. My 6yr & 8 yr loved the snorkeling off the pool area and the poolside ceramic painting was excellent for all ages to enjoy.
