I contacted the hotel and they were more than willing to help me out. They even contacted me to let me know when the tickets had arrived at the hotel and they were waiting for me when I arrived several months later. The rooms were very nicely appointed but what made the stay exceptional was the wonderful service provided by the reception desk staff, the bartender (John) and Nathan the doorman. These people were aware of our travel plans, because they cared enough to ask and then remember. They provided excellent recommendation, direction and were always ready with a warm and welcoming smiles at the end of a long day of site-seeing. We had friends staying at a high end hotel on Piccadilly and upon seeing our hotel and experiencing the service wished they had stayed with us at the Rubens. From London we went to Scotland for a few days and then back to London. We had originally been scheduled to stay at another hotel upon our return for one night. Instead we contacted our travel agent who got us booked back into the Rubens for our return. While the Rubens is not an economy hotel it is also not extremely expensive. I felt we got more than a good value because of the location, the clean and well appointed rooms but especially because of the people working there.

We happend to just miss the Queen leaving the palace for Parliament and unfortuantely would not see her return as we had to be someplace by 2pm. I was a little disappointed in the room but as my husband pointed out that we weren't crowded and had room to move around. The bathroom was decent even tho it seemed small and crowded but maybe that was because of the layout. There was plentiful supply of towels and bathrobes for our use. Our bed was comfortable and the only noise was that of other guests letting their room door slam shut and being near the fire exit the help would go back and forth in the morning and you could hear the swinging doors close. On the most part the hotel doorpersons and concierge were pretty nice but not always there to open the hotel door for you and at times didn't even acknowledge you except for the Scottish guy who I think was part of Concierge was personable. Again you couldn't beat the location. We did not have the breakfast even at the discounted price as we were up and ready to go as soon as we could so would just stop at the Cornish Pastry nearby and picked up a quick bite to eat on the way.

Our room was spotless, well furnished and a decent size with a lovely big bed which gave us a good night's sleep. The room had everything to make our stay enjoyable. However the room appeared to be sandwiched between two buildings and the narrow window looked out onto walls and a multitude of pipes, with little natural light. The hotel had tried to disguise the walls/pipes by putting a trellis on the outside of the window with what appeared to be artificial ivy but sadly this made the outlook even more gloomy.", "title": "Excellent hotel but room without a view", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "KristieH", "date": "May 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130586294}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We didn't eat dinner at the hotel but did have a few drinks in the bar and again the service was second to none, as was breakfast.

All I can say is that we can't wait to go back! Our room was very comfortable and decorated very nicely. The service was excellent...especially Dave Brown who assisted us in where to go and what to do. He was always a friendly face to see when we stepped off the elevator. One of our favorite things to do was to stop in at the lounge after a day of touring, sit by the fire and have a delicious bite to eat and drink. The full English breakfast in the morning was great and they even accomodated my request for \"non dairy\" scrambled eggs. 5 stars to the Reubens!
