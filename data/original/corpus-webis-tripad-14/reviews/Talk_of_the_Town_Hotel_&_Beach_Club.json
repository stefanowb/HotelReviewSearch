It is a relaxing place where you can lay by the pool, sit by the bar and enjoy light meals outside. We wished we had planned a longer stay. The employees are very friendly and helpful, too. The hotel is not a luxury hotel but one that suited us beautifully. You are located close to town which makes it very convenient. The taxi fare is only $6.00 and the drivers are so friendly and give you wonderful information about the island. We would go back there tomorrow and stay alot longer this time.", "title": "WOULD GO BACK THERE IN A MINUTE", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "SCW58", "date": "August 5, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5558176, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 We liked the relaxed friendly atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 It is not directly on the beach"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "I'm not sure if there are two Talk of the Town beach resorts in Aruba but we made reservations at the one just outside the airport. The pictures on the website must have been taken 20 years ago! We only booked one night because our timeshare began on Saturday and we got a great deal on a flight so we came early. They didn't have our reservation, the room we wanted was not available, what kitchen? We were told they had no such thing. The lobby was a mess. The sofa was worn and ripped as well as filthy. Thank God our resort could accomodate us the extra night I would have rather slept in our rental car!!!", "title": "What a dump!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Hamptonmom", "date": "November 1, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 4078557}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "We just spent a week at the Talk of the Town in Aruba. Usually we stay at the Casa Del Mar with timeshare, so keep in mind that may bias my review. Instead of booking on-line, I thought it would be better to call the hotel. It was a last minute trip planned so I called on the Wednesday night before the Saturday we should arrive. The woman on the phone was very friendly and said \"No Problem.\" Upon arrival, the front desk could not find our reservation. She gave us a room anyway but we couldn't get into it because they were re-tiling the area in front. After waiting 20 minutes, I was given another room in a dingy hallway. I went to the front desk to complain since we had paid for a Superior room and this clearly wasn't. After waiting another 10 minutes we were moved to a room on the second floor partially over-looking the pool and partially over-looking the street. This was quit the frustrating experience upon arrival.", "title": "Very Mixed Feelings", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "lizard179", "date": "October 29, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 4070411}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Vacation", "text": "The room was very clean with a VERY old kitchen area so we only used the fridge. The maid service really was not good as we would have a different number of bath towels every time and would have to call down for more. We were definitely able to hear street traffic and planes landing and taking off. There was a previous review that said it was very quiet so we thought that to be a little odd. The rest of the hotel area was under construction so we didn't hang around much.
