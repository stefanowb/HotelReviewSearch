The rooms did not have working air conditioning which was ok as it was not too hot but if it had been over 35 degrees it would have been unbearable. The bathroom was mouldy and small but on par with other italian bathrooms. The breakfast and dinners were very poor, in fact on one of the days we had to fight to get breakfast at all. The hotel is about a 45min bus ride from Sorrento so I don't think I would reccomend staying here if you want to be close to the action.", "title": "Not a great hotel", "user": "T-A-UK", "date": "July 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 8256615}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Despite reading previous reviews and dreading my trip here I was pleasantly suprised that this hotel wasn't as awful as I'd expected.", "title": "Not as bad as painted...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ChrisGilbert", "date": "July 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 8056051}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "It was booked as part of a trip (Travelscope) and was clean,basic and adequate.", "title": "Discerning travellers beware...", "user": "alexandra68", "date": "May 22, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 7670180, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Checking out", "disliked": "\u2014 The Manager"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Massa Lubrense is further away from Sorrento than I'd liked to have been and don't make the mistake of getting a taxi as I did (costing E45 which was pricey)", "title": "Most awful hotel we have ever been to", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kb121", "date": "May 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 7664866, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleaniness", "disliked": "\u2014 Food, rooms, location, lack of facilities"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "Overall a decent accomodation.", "title": "Poor Value at Any Price", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "mec4551", "date": "October 19, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4035552}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Campania", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 4, "very good": 1, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Hotel Reginella Italy/Province Of Naples", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
