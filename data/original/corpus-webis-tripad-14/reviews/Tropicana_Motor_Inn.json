Mainly I can only echo the thoughts of other reviewers to say that this is a really lovely place to stay whilst on Phillip Island and is a great base to explore from. The location in Cowes is excellent and the town itself was lovely and seemed like the best place to be based in on the island. Its just a 15 minute drive to the Koala Conservation Centre and about 20 minutes to the Penguin Parade. I only wish we'd been staying longer so we could have explored the town itself and the surrounding beaches. The room itself was very spacious and clean - the bed was super comfy and being backpackers it was a bit of luxury for us to have a TV, a big ensuite bathroom, fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. The owners were really friendly and helpful and made sure we knew where we were going to get to the Penguin Parade etc. My only additional comment would be that although the motel seemed good value for Phillip Island, it was a bit of a shame that everything else was an additional cost (e.g. breakfast, wifi, spa bath) as we were already at the very top end of our budget. I can understand that breakfast would be an extra cost, but it would have been nice to have been given even a limited wifi allowance. But overall, a really great place to stay that I would definitely recommend and we would love to return for a slightly longer stay.", "title": "Convenient location, friendly and helpful managers, good value", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Vancouverite67", "date": "April 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127210684}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled solo", "text": "On Philip Island, what I would say a cheap but great place to stay in! 20 mins drive to Penguin Parade , 25 mins drive to Nobbies. 2 mins drive to the nearest Woolworths (supermarket).
