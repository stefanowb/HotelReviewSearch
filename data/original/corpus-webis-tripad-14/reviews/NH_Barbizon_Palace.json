The maid service every day was excellent, and all the staff friendly and extremely helpful. The TV didnt have much choice in channels in English, and the movies were slightly expensive, however you dont go to Amsterdam to stay in the room! The rrom itself was quiet, however we did hear some slight door banging to either side, it was not disturbing though. As we had requested a smoking room, this was inside the hotel so we had no outside noise as it looked onto a closed courtyard, not the best view but we were outside a lot of the time anyway.
