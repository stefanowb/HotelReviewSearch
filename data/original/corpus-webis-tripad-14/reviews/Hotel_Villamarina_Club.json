I have only been on 2 all inclusive holidays before and both were a disaster (food barely edible and very limited choice, entertainment awful etc.etc...). The Villamarina was the total opposite. The hotel itself is very clean and well maintained as are the two pools and outside areas. The room was big enough (2 adult,2 children) and again very clean (the maids came EVERY day). The food was excellent (and hot) with plenty of choice. beef, veal, chicken, thai curry, chicken madras, chicken masala, salmon, spag bol, chilli con carne, roast spuds broccolli cauliflower cheese to name but a few of the meals witnessed on my 1 week stay..... the list goes on, even the snack bar had a choice of pizza,hotdog,chips,hamburger,nuggetts and even fishfingers. The all inclusive drinks included a choice of 8 alcoholic cocktails and 3 kiddie cocktails as well as the usual lager and spirits. Now for the good bit!!!! lol . The entertainment team (Hello Tiny and Liz - sorry we didnt say goodbye) they always greeted with a smile and worked tirelessly to make sure that the guests were never bored. From quizzes and sports activities like volleyball,football,rifle shooting, water polo etc.. to entertaining the guests in the evening. There was also a park and an outside cinema screen showing the latest children and family films (both within site of the outside terrace) so the adults could watch the entertainment and their children at the same time........great!!
