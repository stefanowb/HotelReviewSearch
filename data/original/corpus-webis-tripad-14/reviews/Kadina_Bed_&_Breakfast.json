There is no such pretentiousness here. It is like staying in a warm, cosy and luxurious farmhouse - albeit a quality modern variety. You would never guess such a lovely place like this was tucked away in the outskirts of Holt - but it definitely is THE place to stay if you like walking and the outdoors. No wearing of shoes upstairs either, which I think is a very good policy. From the moment you step into your room you get the feeling that the holiday has begun - even if it is only a weekend! That's because the furnishings and fittings are well-designed and there are fresh flowers in the room. I loved the lace tray cloths and the view (from the small window) over garden and heathland. Kadina is perfectly placed for walks on the Kelling Heath SSSI and if you are a bit of a train spotter, on your outing you will love seeing locomotive smoke through the trees - you are very near the heritage (but daily timetabled) train line to Sheringham. Have I mentioned the cooking? We were welcomed in the afternoon by a cream tea (no less) and despatched with some delicious home-baked fruit cake for our train journey home. In between, had the best ever three course breakfasts to order.
