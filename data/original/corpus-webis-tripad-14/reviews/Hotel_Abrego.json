There is not one complaint we had, and the price was excellent. Honestly, all of the chain hotels need to send employees here to learn how to run a hotel. The minute we arrived I was already impressed. It is in a good location and was easy to find off the highway. The property is very new and looks like it to as it is very well maintained. When we went to check in, there was no wait and the service was unbelievable. Probably the most personable employee I've found yet. She was recommending restaraunts, things to do, how to get there, etc. great job!!!! Our room was upstairs in the main building and was easy to access. The room was spotless and quaint, which fit's this town perfectly. The room is very romantic too with a fireplace, chaise, and a very comfortable bed. There is nice stone surrounding the fireplace and beautiful dark wood around the tv, both nightstands, and the desk. The bathroom was great as well with a stone floor and matching shower walls. The whole room was very modern. Next, the price! I have to start off by saying most hotel rooms in this area (and motels) run about $80-130 per night. We paid $130 for a night, and I would have been fine paying $300-400 per night.

After about 20 minutes I went back to reception to find out what was going on, at this point we were told it had been sorted and were given a room key. It took us about 5 minutes to find the room because it was tucked away down a narrow outside passageway with narrow steps both up and down. I refused to accept this and went back to reception to complain, we were then very ungraciously given another room with better access. This room was OK, rather cramped but after our 5 hour travelling to get here and the problems on arrival we had had enough. The rooms have no sound proofing and you could hear everything going on next door and above. This has nothing to do with the hotel but we were woken at 2.30am by the couple next door having a domestic row which went on until about 4 am when one of them stormed off in a vehicle.
