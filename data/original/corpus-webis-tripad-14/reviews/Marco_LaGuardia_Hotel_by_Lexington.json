Our plans were to stay at the Sheraton, but late registration also meant no vacancies. We decided on the Marco Hotel, since it was close to our meetings. What a find! We were greeted by a friendly staff, and after we settled into our room, decided to venture out for dinner. Giving it was a late hour, we decided to check out the hotel restaurant. Not quite sure what to expect, but expecting something mediocre at the very least.. we were pleasantly surprised to find our meal was top notch, and we were well attended to by our wonderful server Cesar. A visit to our table, and nice conversation with the Manager, Daniel, along with a complimentary glass of wine, and we were completely taken with this hotel restaurant & staff. If that wasn't enough, along came Eddie the hotel concierge, a sweet Italian man who charmed us and had us laughing and sharing stories... like an old friend walked into the room for a visit, He offered to drive us over to the Sheraton, pick us up after our meetings, and even offered to take us to the airport! The following day we checked out early for more meetings, and back at the hotel at rush hour to retrieve our luggage. Again, we opted to have dinner at the hotel restaurant and to do some follow up work, while we waited out the traffic. With out laptops in tow, we were again welcomed to use a table as we worked, and again had another amazing meal with the same wonderful service we had the evening before. I cannot say enough about the first rate old-fashioned customer service we received at this hotel restaurant. The rooms were accommodating, and clean, and adequate for what we needed during our stay. Our luggage was held after checkout in a secure area. The shuttle service was a nice bonus. Nearby Asian, Thai restaurants (try the Green Papaya) that were wonderful- just ask and you will be directed to a favorite. We felt very safe in this neighborhood, and did not hesitate to walk around. The price was reasonable, the parking at $19/day was exceptional, and we were very very pleased with our stay!", "title": "First Rate Customer Service", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "happytotravel57", "date": "November 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146405108}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed in a studio room (with a small kitchen).
