It was a beautiful hotel and well run. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. There were a couple of conventions going on at the same time and they handled it well. The room was clean and comfortable. We had a balcony which was a real bonus. I LOVE the fact that it's non-smoking. I wish they would eliminate the smoking outside under the canopies and at the pool as well. The restaurants have very good food, but are extremely expensive. Be prepared. It's also not located near anything else, so if you don't have a car, you'll need to purchase shuttle transportation to go into town. You would think that for the cost of the rooms, they would offer that at no cost, but they don't. The shuttles run every hour or half-hour, depending on the time of day, and the drivers are just as friendly and helpful as the hotel staff. They also charged $30 round trip for the airport shuttle, which I thought was excessive.", "title": "Great Place to Stay", "user": "Frances N", "date": "September 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117590160}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We were with my sister who had a conference.
