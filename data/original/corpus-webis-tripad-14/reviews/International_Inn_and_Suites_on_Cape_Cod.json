My husband and I stayed here as a get away. Having 2 children with autism, getting away doesn't happen much. I was a bit suprised when we first pulled into the parking lot. I really didn't expect to see the place layed out quite the way it was. I found the front desk staff were ok. Not rude, just really flat personalities. But I wasn't going to allow that to form my opinion of the whole place. We got the Princess Jr. Suite. I was a little suprised by how \"dated\" the room appeared. The whirlpool I thought was pretty cool though. Not quite \"Heart\" shaped, but plenty big enough for two. I read complaints about the \"canopy\" bed, and I thought it was pretty interesting how they made the canopy bed. I actually stole the idea, and plan on making the make shift canopy beds for my daughters. I did encounter opened toiletries. I would really suggest the cleaning staff check to make sure the seals haven't been opened when they do their cleaning. We did have dinner at the restaraunt, and I didn't think it was all that bad. I had the fettucini alfredo with chicken, and my husband had the chicken parm. We were waited on promptly, and enjoyed having a quiet dinner to ourselves. We had the chocolate covered strawberries that were waiting in our fridge when we arrived. They actually were really good. I did have a vending machine eat $5, but hey that happens everywhere! I didn't find the bed terribly uncomfortable. I have slept on much worse at higher end hotels! I just enjoyed having time alone with my husband for a change. We got up in the morning for our complimentary breakfast. I was actually impressed by the size of the breakfast buffet. Pretty much had everything imaginable, and the wait staff was really nice. We actually were seated, and given the remote control for the TV in case we didn't like what was on. We ate our fill (which was way too much!), and were on our way shortly after. Needless to say, our stay wasn't horrible. I know they are in the process of renovating, and changing management can have its own set of problems. But I guess my husband and I have an adventurous side, and we just took things as they came. I would definitley recommend that they update the rooms, but all in all it wasn't horrible. And this comes from someone that has stayed at the Hotel Commonwealth, and The Hyatt in Boston. For the price, it was worth it. I've paid $350 a night for hotels (Hyatt in Boston), and I didn't have as much fun. If you are expecting the Four Seasons, then this may not be the place for you.

I booked the room through the expedia and I did so because for a couple of extra bucks we were able to reserve a Jacuzzi suite instead of just a plain old room offered at other hotels in the area. THEN, i decided to read the reviews and i immediately started to get nervous. OMG, the reviews were down right harsh, so i decided that after our stay here, i was obligated to write a glowing review to counter the horror stories scribbled throughout the web\u2019s vastness. Downtown Hyannis was a buzz w/ activity that night, so it was comforting knowing that we had a parking spot waiting for us right in the middle of it all. Check-in was quick and efficient due to the friendly, well-staffed front desk. We reserved a princess suite, but we were upgraded to a royal Victorian suite. Was the room tacky? Yes, yes, in fact, it was. Again it was Victorian styled and it was very unique compared to a regular hotel room. Do you have any idea how much the room\u2019s color scheme effected our ability to sleep on a comfy, clean king size bed? God only knows. The only thing that interrupted our slumber was the yahoo who parked right in front of our bedroom w/ his flashers on, so I immediately called the front desk to complain, after all, it\u2019s their responsibility to control every person\u2019s, every action, every second of every day. Actually I didn\u2019t, instead I opened the curtains and gave the yahoo a wtf look. After sighting Casper the tired and unfriendly ghost in his skivvies, the flashers were quickly extinguished. Oh, and then the next morning we were forced to partake in this so-called \u201ccomplementary breakfast\u201d. Auch, it was just dreadful, so dreadful in fact, I went back for more delicious link sausage, succulent scrambled eggs (who cares if they\u2019re instant), tasty home fries, and mouth-watering bacon. Dude, they had bacon, nuff said! Oh wait, now I remember the most traumatic moment of our dining experience, my gf had lipstick on her coffee cup and the utterly uncouth staff had the nerve to immediately replace it w/ brand new piping hot one. Can you believe that? And then get this, the French toast was a little on the cold side, so when we asked the waiter if he would be able to give our French toast a quick, little nukey, nuke, do you know what he had the audacity to retort our simple request with? \u201cYes, sir, no problem. I apologize for that and we should be bringing some fresh French toast out shortly. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I KNOW RIGHT, UNBEIVIBLE! Obviously my review is laced w/ sarcasm and since a font has not yet been devised to aid the cynically challenged, here it is in black and white: The room was clean and comfortable. There were no bugs (of any kind), nor was there hair everywhere. The tub was enormous and the double showerheads were soul soothing. The exhaust fan was loud and the suspended ceiling was drooping a bit, but alas, I was spending an evening here, not procuring a domicile for my ultimate eternity. My only complaint w/ our entire sojourn was the creepy guy residing across the hall from us, but I\u2019m quite certain he had the exact same complaint.", "title": "Everything is amazing and nobody is happy'", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "kuelhand", "date": "August 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116280196}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "what a dump", "text": "we were looking for a nice place for our anniversary so me and the wife and another couple went to cuddles and bubbles now the rooms look really nice on the website but you pull up and it reminds you of something out of the 1970s with the long curtains and it just looked run down. we checked in and went to our rooms the hallways smelled like chlorine and we were almost expecting to find a indoor pool which there wasnt one. we went to a nice little irish pub for dinner which was very good then went back to the inn for a few drinks in the lounge. the floor was missing tiles and the drinks were just ok. we went back to our rooms for the night the jacuzzi was nice just make sure you dont underfill it thats why i think the hallways smell like that. the bed felt like a 2 inch piece of foam on a piece or plywood it moved alot the covers kept coming off and we both woke up with severe back pain. all in all it was a terrrible experience and i would suggest looking around before booking so quick", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 13, 2006", "id": 5065392}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I realy liked this place", "text": "My many stays at cuddles and Bubbles have always been good ones.

You can enter the hot tub by stepping of the king-sized bed. The room, and the hotel in general, smells terrible - a mixture of poorly covered smoke (in the so-called \"non-smoking area\" no less), rotting ocean plants and wet sand.
