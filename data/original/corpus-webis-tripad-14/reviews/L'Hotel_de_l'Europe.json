We had no choice when it came to the hotel - this is where the university puts you when it's paying the bill. The hotel has rooms with and without ensuite facilities. Ours had a toilet and shower, but I almost wished that it didn't. For those of you who plan to share a room and are a little shy about body functions, well, it feels as though the toilet and shower are in the bed with you and your partner. Not very romantic ... You might prefer to use the facilities down the hall.", "title": "Clean and convenient but charmless", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "frogoutofwater", "date": "March 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 4720896}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "The room was so small one of us had to stand on the bed if the other one needed to move from one side of the room to the other. The tiny TV bolted to the wall by the ceiling could only be watched if you were willing to lie on your back on the bed. The bed was not very comfortable and was equipped with two thin pillows. And the floor tilted a bit. But the room, the bed and the bathroom were clean. We had no view out onto the street, but that probably meant that our room was quieter than the others.", "title": "OK, but smoky room...", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "2snows", "date": "March 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4689858}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Rhone-Alpes", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 12, "very good": 22, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 8}, "aka": "l Hotel Grenoble", "slim_ranking": 0.450980392157}
