No bedside lamps, there was a phone, but it was not functional, so when we needed to phone reception to ask how we were supposed to shower in cold water, we had to use our mobile to call the hotel! After asking for hot water, they said they would investigate and that we shoud run it for 5 minutes. After running the shower for about 10 minutes, hot water finally arrived. Our double room had no kitchenette so we can't comment on the self-catering aspect. Their kitchen was not finished, so breakfast was by way of a voucher that we could use at a local cafe. We had no fan or air conditioning in the room, so it was pretty damned hot during the day and we had to sleep with the window open.
