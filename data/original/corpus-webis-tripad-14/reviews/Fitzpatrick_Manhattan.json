Our experience started before we even got there when we were upgraded from a room to a suite at no extra cost! The location is perfect with a lot of destinations within a few minutes walk and the rest only a short taxi ride or subway trip away. The quality of the rooms were excellent, very clean and freshly decorated. The staff couldn't have been more friendly, offering excellent local advice on everything which saved us hours of searching and, not to say, hundreds of dollars. The bar was nice and cosy and the food was good, for the few occasions we ate in. I would really have to be very picky if I was to find anything negative to say so I wont!

By New York standards this a a small boutique Hotel. You may ask why an Irishman would choose an Irish owned Hotel in a city with so much choice but while obviously proud of its \"Irishness\" it is not Overdone. The location of the Hotel is perfect for Shopping (5th Ave),Central Park and many other of The Midtown attractions all within walking distance. Our room (1206) was a little small by european standards but big by New York standards it served our needs perfectly. No bath but a lovely spacious shower. The sounds of the City could be heard at night but did not affect my sleep and only added to the NYC experience. The room was spotless and the Housekeeping Staff were great letting you have a Sleep In if you wanted.Saying that that is the Biggest strength of this Hotel. THE STAFF ARE FANTASTIC EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ARE TEN OUT OF TEN.Special mention to Ciarian, Chris, Aoife,Christina, Anna, Christian,Brian and Peter but in truth the were all Excellent . Nothing was too much trouble from Service with a smile to friendly Conversation to advice on the City to Booking attractions. Well done Mr Fitz your staff do your lovely hotel proud.his will be my Haven for any future trips to NYC.
