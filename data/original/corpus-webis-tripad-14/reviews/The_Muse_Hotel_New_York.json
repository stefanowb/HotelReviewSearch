This hotel was it!! I found a great deal on Orbitz, and after reading other Trip Advisor reviews, I decided to go with The Muse. I was not disappointed. The room was HUGE! Huge room, huge bathroom, impeccably decorated, very clean...it was great. There were three of us in this room (me, a teenager, and an 8 year old) and we didn't feel crowded at all. Even though the building was obviously a little bit older, it had been updated and therefore it felt very plush inside. Other benefits included a nice lobby area (free wine reception every evening, but with two kids in tow we didn't partake), friendly service, robes, comfy beds, flat screen TV, and a great bell staff. The first night we noticed that something was wrong with the air conditioner in our room. The next morning I notified the front desk, and it was fixed by the time we came back from sightseeing. It was a 2-minute walk (or less) to the main bustle of Times Square, but being on a side street, we didn't notice the noise of it. It was nice to be a little bit removed from the action. There was a restaurant on site. Our first day there was free breakfast, so we ate there and it was very good. We didn't on the other days because we thought it was a little out of our budget. My only main complaint about The Muse is that it would've been handy to have a business center, or even just a computer with Internet access and a printer.

In fact, one bath towel was so worn it had holes in it big enough for my hand to go through (Really!). However, once I brought this to the attention of housekeeping, they replaced the damaged towels.
