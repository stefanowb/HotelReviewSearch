I needed a hotel close to the airport and one with an airport shuttle. The hotel's shuttle service was awful, and I was picked up 80 minutes after I first called the hotel; I saw each hotel's vans go by two and three times with drivers hoping out to get their guests bags. When the Ramada van arrived the driver just opened the door, making no attempts to move. When I got to the hotel I could hardly hear because of the loud bass thumping from the hotel's lounge. I asked if my package had arrived, and the desk clerk said it had not. I had to go to my room, access the UPS website to prove the package had, indeed, been \"delivered\" that morning, and I had to go into their back room and find the box myself! The TV remote control did not work. The reviews I had read before booking said the A/C units didn't work, but I didn't think that mattered since it was Nov. 30 and you don't need the A/C. But I was wrong because there's no heat either! The carpet had visible stains. This over-priced hotel does not provide a complimentary breakfast. Although they have an on-site restaurant, there was only two wait staff and one busser for this large hotel that was sold out because one of the airlines had given out vouchers. Even though I was a party of one, the gratuity was included in the cost! The checkout line was so long I thought I might miss the 9:00 a.m. shuttle. I told the driver I needed to be dropped off at the rental car facility. I was dropped off so far away from the facility it took me 30 minutes to use the walkways that took me to the tram that goes to the rentals. I caught a cold three days later, and I'm sure I got infected at the Ramada.", "title": "Don't book a room here", "user": "Cynthia H", "date": "December 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 147087674}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The convenience of transportation to and from the airport is something I could handle.The room service could have been better,they need to pay attention to the air-condition units (the one in my room kept loud noises all during the night).", "title": "Not for Long stay.Just for shopping !", "user": "sunshine12188", "date": "December 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 146723673}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The one thing that this hotel has going for it is location, location, location. 49th Street is a shopper's paradise.

Stay away from the lounge and restaurant- Complete rip off with their pricing! Nice location. IHOP, Mall, Red Lobster, bank and many others in walking distance.

I went to the concierge desk to ask for directions....the two gentlemen there were busy looking at their ipad or tablet and laughing...I had to wait. Calling front desk at 9pm for a wake up call, I cradled the phone over my shoulder for approximately 5 minutes before I got a reply. The bedroom is dated, the popcorn ceilings though painted are decaying...the corridors are just old..on the website it says recently renovated in 2011...don't see how this could be. Aside from gutting it, not sure if the rooms can be brought up to scratch. At 5.30am the lobby was full as the hotel seems to be used for cruise ship crew lodging and they were all waiting for departure. I watched as each one went to the reception to ask for something and the lady hardly raised her head up from the computer...why? they are guests too are they not? mind you I wasn't treated any better.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "natmicstef", "date": "January 18, 2013", "id": 149955198}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013", "text": "Didn't like the place.
