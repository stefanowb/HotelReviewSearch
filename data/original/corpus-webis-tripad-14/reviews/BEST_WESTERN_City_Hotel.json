The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were great and the beds were comfortable. They did tell us they could give us adjoining rooms but they are separate; however looking on the emergency route map there are no adjoining rooms, so we think they mistook our request as adjacent - my teenage girls think it's great they have their very own room so no biggie for us!! The rooms are a decent size, especially for a European hotel and the bathrooms are marvellous - a huge big tub, a powerful shower and very spacious. Breakfast was very comprehensive, one of the best selections of our trip and my husband loved the bacon which we'd read about in a review posted only a few days ahead of our stay and he was already looking forward to it! Yes the hotel is outside Bologna centre but it only took us 15 minutes to get to the old city so it's not exactly a looong hike and there are a lot of arcades (Bologna is noted for them) so plenty of shade to walk in. Parking is free and they have lots of it, including a covered garage. The wifi is also free, you just have to ask for the code at the desk, and they have a computer in the reception/lounge area for communal use too if you don't bring your own. If I had one comment not 100% positive it would be about the reception furniture, I'm not sure it's really retro but it's definitely alternative; however if all the hotels I went to looked like that at the front desk, yet the rooms and service were as nice as here, I could learn to love that look! I would stay here again in a heartbeat.", "title": "Loved this hotel!", "user": "atwied", "date": "July 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 70271992}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent 3 days in the Best Western Hotel in Bologna.

The lady from the restaurant makes capuccino and expresso by request. The hotel doesn`t seem very soundproof, since one night I heard someone snoring, but in January most of the rooms were free, so it didn`t bothered us. The distance to the railway station is ok (10-15 min by foot) and the neighborhood makes no problems(we usually came home at 8.30-9, when already dark and felt no danger around).
