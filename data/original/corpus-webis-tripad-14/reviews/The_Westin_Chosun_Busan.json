It had impeccable rooms and service (especially on the \"executive\" floor) and a GREAT gym overlooking the Westin Chosun beach. The hotel restaurants were pricey--$10 for an espresso at the bar?? Give me a break!--but we got a steep discount on the room so didn't complain too much. The hotel is in a great location if you're interested in the beach and nearby restaurants and Buddhist templates. It straddles a small peninsula that has a walking/jogging path and some beautiful views of the beach and Busan bridge. Given the size of the city and heavy traffic I can't say whether the hotel is in the best location for business but it's definitely good for leisure.

Be forewarned, it is on the pricey side. Due to a booking misunderstanding on my part, I paid more for one night then I had intended, some $235 for a single night. As a solo traveler that put a severe crimp in my personal plans. However, if you're there to get away, relax, enjoy some downtime without worrying too much about budget, this hotel is the place for you. Its decor is tasteful and relaxing. In the lobby/lounge there is live entertainment provided by a pianist, celloist, and occasionally a violinist. The in-house restaurant was very nice and had an abundent selection at the food bar. There is a swimming pool, fitness center, and sauna which I visited personally and was very pleased with. I actually lost my iPod in the locker room and it was returned to me so quickly I hardly knew it was gone. Foreign guests needn't worry about power conversions or being able to simply communicate: the staff speaks very good English and there are power outlets for Western and Korean machinery. The hotel is literally right on the water and able to be enjoyed as your eating or relaxing inside as well. Other than the price tag, I have only two other issues that surfaced: one is the heating. I've read other reviews regarded the heating and cooling of each room. It is uncommonly warm in the bedroom and it doesn't seem to get cooler. My advice is to leave the window open. Also, for those of us who need the internet, access is not free. You have to play by time block to access the net. Other than that, I enjoyed my time at the Westin Chosun and fully plan to return in the future.", "title": "Beyond Expectations", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Avari20", "date": "April 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27898294}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We were so impressed by the service we received at the Westin Chosen.

But the other rooms that are bigger do not allow children under the age of 12. Who knows why? The hotel staff was very accomodating in providing a baby crip and rollaway bed for the kids. The view is great and the park behind the hotel is wonderful to explore. Everything is within walking distance. The train is about a 20 minute walk and the restaurants are about a 10 minute walk. There is a Starbucks 5 minutes in either direction. :) If walking isn't your thing, then the conierge is always happy to hail a cab from the cab pool. The pool and fitness center is great and accomodating. The business center is available with free internet. I was disappointed that the hotel didn't have free wireless throughout.
