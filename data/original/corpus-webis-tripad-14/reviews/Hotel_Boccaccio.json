They are obviously in the process of completely renovating this hotel floor by floor as our rooms has been done to an incredibly high standard. We had 3 rooms and although they varied in size they were all very nice and comfortable. Fabulous new fixtures and fitting and very well designed. Yes the majority of other guests were Spanish and some Germans but that didn't make any difference. Most of the staff spoke very good English and with our lousy Spanish we were understood all the time. Our groups ages ranged from 19 to 40ish (!) and as we were all inslusive we spent our evenings in the bar joining in with the other guests. They had various entertainment on which was very good. Even the bingo was done in Spanish & English. The Spanish guests were delighted when we joined in their dancing and we even showed them a few moves of our own. The Staff were on the whole lovely and friendly especially Jaime who worked the bar in the evenings. The pool area was lovely and there were plenty of loungers. The beach is only a 5 minute walk away as well being right by the lake which you can walk round a fair way. I really couldn't fault it. I do think that some people wouldn't enjoy it because it isn't a hotel that just caters for Brits but to me that is a bonus!!

We couldn't fault the food for the price we paid ( \u00a3250 each for flights, transfers and A1) Upon arrival after midnight we were shown into the dining area where a small buffet had been laid out , we were also given a drinks voucher to get 2 free drinks at the cocktail bar as A1 had ended. You could help yourself to beer, coffee, tea, soft drinks, water, wine and sangria at the Hotel and Beach Bar. The beach bar was a godsend on the beach, lots of tables and chairs but not many sunbeds, some people just used bLow up beds which could be bought locally instead Do not forget to bring beach towels as they are not provided at the hotel. Part of the dining area overlooked the lake and was a quiet pleasant area to eat your evening meal, it is through the patio doors at the back of the dining room. To the front of the hotel was the Hotel cocktail bar which was quite pleasant but not part of A1, we just took our a1 drinks out there. We were quite satisfied with the food, one night there was ribs, another mussels and duck al'orange etc, we still took the opportunity to eat out on two occasions, once at the Tapas Restaurant 'S'amfora' Which was excellent, but the portions are big so be warned, we also dined at 'Roma' opposite the hotel, which was served pizza, grilled food etc. My chicken kebab on a scewer was very dry and a disappointment and my partners seafood pizza was bland, it may have just been an off day as the restaurant always seemed to be busy and it is not the cheapest place to eat.", "title": "Fantastic short break!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "magspool", "date": "July 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 168411998}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "The clientele is predominantly German, Dutch, and Scandinavian, but this didn't bother us and we did meet a few other British couples with whom we had a drink and a laugh with.
