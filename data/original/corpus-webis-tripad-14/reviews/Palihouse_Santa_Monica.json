It cost us more than staying at a major chain, yet had fewer amenities. We have stayed at many hotel apartments in Canada, Europe and the U.S. and this was the least pleasing. The room we stayed in had an unpleasant odour. We had a view of the recycling and garbage bins on one side of the room. We could not sleep due to the noise from outside. The cooking utensils were very old and the non-stick cookware was scratched beyond recognition. The large and small appliances are very old. Staff is not available from 8:00p.m. to 8:00 a.m. so if you are traveling with children, this could pose an issue in case you need someone in the middle of the night.

It is not plush, but it has lots of room and character. There is no room service, a strange contraption for an elevator, and only street parking which can be elusive. The place really grew on us.

We needed our last 3 days to be slightly more restful than the previous 2 weeks had been. Before we left San Diego, we checked out a few suggestions from Trip Advisor, for Venice and Santa Monica. We viewed a couple of places towards the beach and found them to be totally overpriced and, one in particular, challenged in the hygiene department! So we decided to explore further in a couple of blocks and discovered the Embassy. From the roadside, the building is impressive. The architecture is stunning and it is obvious from the well tended gardens and highly maintained exterior, that this place is looked after by people who care deeply for this beautiful property. As soon as you enter, a feeling of serenity wraps itself around you. It is tranquil, cool and transports you to a by-gone era. Josh welcomed us and offered no objection when we asked to see the room. I knew before we even opened the door that it was going to suit us perfectly. We occupied a 1 bedroomed suite which was huge. In the hands of a \"chain\", the space would have housed at least 6 guests. It was well equipped and furnished with good quality, aged, furniture; and the linen was top quality. The room rate was extremely reasonable, compared to the previous places we had viewed. All in all, a thoroughly good find, of which I would not hesitate to recommend to fellow travelers. It is situated 2 blocks from the beach and just as close to all the shops and restaurants, whilst nestling in a quiet residential area. A huge bonus is the free parking. Every other hotel we looked at insisted on valet parking, at $24 per day!
