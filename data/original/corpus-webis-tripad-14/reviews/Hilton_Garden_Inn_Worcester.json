The hotel's check in time is 4pm, but our rooms were ready at 1pm and we were able to check in then, the front desk clerk was very nice as was the staff at the breakfast served in the lobby in the morning ( a great selection). Also very convenient and a big plus is that a Pizzeria Uno is attached to the hotel, (this helps when in unfamiliar surroundings at night and this area appeared a bit unseemly). While The Pizzeria Uno is new and needs adjustment time also, their staff was very friendly, food good for that type of venue. The hotel itself is brand new and beatifully decorated, the rooms clean and also well decorated.
