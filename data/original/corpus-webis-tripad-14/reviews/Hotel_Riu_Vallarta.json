The personal service, welcome drink and tour were not a part of our very long check in process. The front desk seemed very disorganized and I won't say that they were rude, but we felt like we were inconveniencing them. The room was as expected. We booked a Jr Suite and it looked just like the pictures. We were in room 7039 overlooking the courtyard with an ocean view. Our only complaint with the room was that the smoke detector flashes red lights constantly. We thought it was just ours and had maintenance up twice to look at it, but after talking with other guests found out that all of them flash.
