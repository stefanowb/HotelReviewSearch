Room service we were told leave the hotel premises everyday at about 5pm. We left our hotel room at about 11am the same day allowing room service six full hours in which they were supposed to clean our room before our return. This never happened. We politely asked Ms Garza for the telephone number to her immiediate supervisor in which she responded that she did not have an immediate supervisor. We also asked that she provide us with contact information to the Managers of the facility. That request also met a brickwall.
