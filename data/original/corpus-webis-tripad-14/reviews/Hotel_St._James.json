When we arrived we asked for a room on a low floor after reading the reviews on this site about the lifts being very slow. We got room 208 which is on the second floor directly facing the lifts and stairs so that was fine. With it being on a low floor there was noise of people going up and down the stairs but not overly noisy. Anyways when we went into the room first it was cold so went down to reception to ask them to switch on the radiator as it was behind a panel under window which needed to be screwed off in order to switch it on. They obliged and done it, went to bed that night and woke up the next morning and it was still not working, room was freezing. Said it to them at reception and they said no problem later on when you return from you day out we will move you to another room. One other thing about that room, is that in the bathroom there is a pipe which runs down the wall which is not enclosed so when others where having showers on upper floors you could hear the noise of water rushing down the pipe a bit annoying to say the least. So we were moved to the 8th floor, pretty much the same floor but with out the the noises, radiator worked fine. One other thing about this hotel is that none of the windows lock. Well seemed that way both of the rooms i stayed in you could not lock the windows and in the other room a friend of mine stayed in he could not lock his either.

Good sized clean room, nice sized bathroom, plenty of hot water & towels, helpful friendly staff.

One caveat - request a room away from the street when you book, the street noises can be brutal at 5 a.m. if you're staying there on trash day!

Sure, the walls could stand a new coat of paint, and the carpet was threadbare in spots, but with this sort of convenience, cleanliness, and economical rates, who would have the nerve to nitpick?
