We were greeted on arrival by Ana, one of the Red Level personnel. We were booked in while enjoying a lovely glass of cold Cava. She then showed us to our room - wow!! We had decided to try one of their Grand Ocean Suites and it was truly amazing. (see photos). Last year the hotel took 14 rooms on the 7th floor and made them into 7 suites. We spent a lot of time enjoying this room and will certainly have no hesitation in booking one next year. Walk in wardrobe, lovely sitting area with balcony, huge bed (not two beds pushed together!), another balcony off the bedroom and an amazing bathroom with twin sinks, double rain shower and very large bath. The amenities were all Clarins. We were presented with a bottle of Mo\u00ebt, chocolate dipped strawberries and a wonderful arrangement of fruit. We're not sure if this was because I'm a Melia Gold Card holder or because we were returnees! We so enjoyed our first evening!! The housekeeping is excellent.

We upgraded to Red Level as we thought that this would enable us to experience the best services that the hotel had to offer. Oh dear! If this is the best that Melia can do in their Grand Luxe 5 star hotels, then they need to re-think! First, check in was a let down. Indifferent welcome by reception staff, some inexplicable delay with their paperwork and no Red Level privileges explained. The room was on the fourth floor, in the centre of the curved building, with a sea view. Please note that although these rooms have balconies, their position in the block means that they don't really get any sun. Beds were reasonably comfortable but as other reviewers have mentioned, doubles are converted singles. There's a pillow menu. Bathroom was poor especially the shower which desperately needs upgrading! Red Level meant Clarins shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and body moisturiser which were replenished on a regular basis by housekeeping. TV was terrible - about half the channels didn't receive a signal. Wi-Fi was acceptable speed. Of the two wardrobes, one accommodated the safe and hanging space was limited, and the other had a rail running back to the front (very old fashioned!) which offered ridiculously limited hanging space. Minibar was well stocked if you like that kind of thing, but complimentary bottled water was in very limited supply. I wasn't aware there was an ice machine on our floor until another guest told me!
