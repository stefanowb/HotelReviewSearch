Check in was a laborious procedure wanting credit card authorisations or cash upfront as a deposit. We went up to the room and the coffee machine didnt work at first which was annoying so someone had to come out. In the bathroom i spotted at least 3 silverfish on the dirty floor and pubes in the bathtub. The duvet didnt have a cover and the pillows were so soft and the bed uncomfortable i hardly slept at all and the air con was temperamental, the coffee pot at breakfast leaked everywhere, they forgot the bread basket and I was disgusted at how overpriced breakfast in bed is, 55 quid for 2 people... ridiculous! on check out the maid went to check the room and came back to say we had smoked in the room, because she found a cigarette butt in an empty water bottle and they charged us 200 quid, apparently it was now impossible to rent out the room due to smoke damage but yet when i said that i would then take the room because apparently no one could possibly use it according to the manageress the receptionist then wanted the room rate on top.... Yes i smoked leaning out of the window ONE cigarette, and the window had been open from 9 am til 12 am so there was no smell at all, but to fine me and then treat me like I had committed the crime of the century was over the top, I asked if they could waive the charge but the mean manageress said there was no way she could and it left what could have been a nice stay into the worst possible hotel experience. The rest of the day we were left feeling cheated, ripped off and really upset by the ordeal.
