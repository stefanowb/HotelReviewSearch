Hopefully, some of these tips can help you. The hotels in PR tend to be pricy - Paradisus included. However, Paradisus serves decent food in the buffets, very good food in the reservations required places and has top shelf drinks included - the value is not bad as compared to other places. Paradisus has nice, large rooms with balconies. The beach is OK, not great. But the pools are wonderful and the place is large - i.e. not crowded. The service staff is primarily younger folks (this is not their career unlike what you find in many other Carribean destinations) - you see many of the things that can come with that - service is not always rapid fire or accurate - but it is generally very good. The hotel is well outside of San Juan. If you want to do excursions with a tour company, you get stuck with the inevitable waits you see anywhere in the world. (I abhor waits and shuttles) Here's some advice - if you are going to leave the resort and tour or partake in excursions, rent a car. Driving in PR is easy, rental cars are cheap, picking them up at the airport is fast and easy, self park is close to the rooms. A lot of cool stuff can be done on your own, you don't need a tour company. Or, hook up with the tour company at the destination rather than waiting on a shuttle. There are a lot of people from the North East. They, generally, have a more brusque approach to things - if that really bothers you, don't go to PR because it is a big destination for New Yorkers.", "title": "Pretty Darned Good", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "SkiKat", "date": "February 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6816036, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very good spa", "disliked": "\u2014 distance from room to pool etc."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A week in paradise", "text": "I felt I needed to add a review to this website after using it in preparation for our family's trip.

Our party included 18 people ranging in age from my grandparents to young cousins. I am a 29 year old male. I should note here that our last family trip to an all-inclusive resort was a disaster. Stay away from Playa Naco in the Dominican Republic at all costs. Paradisus was head and shoulders above our last experience. The trip to and from the airport was about 40 minutes by van and not bad at all. Our first order of business was an upgrade to royal service. I recommend this move if your budget allows. It provided access to a few extra ammenities including a separate royal service pool (ask for the mojitos), and some upgrades in rooms and dining. The all inclusive food and drink worked out very well for our party. It was great to be able to eat or get a drink at any time, day or night. My uncle was able to force me into a shot of tequila and a beer as I stepped out of breakfast one morning. The quality of the food was very good over all. This included the breakfast (good omelettes) and lunch buffets, and all of the different restaurants on sight. The only negatives here were the slow service at one or two of the restaurants, and some confusion over reservations. Not bad over all. Room service (try the quesadilla) and butlers were also free with royal service. The main pool in the center of the resort was a lot of fun for all including water basketball and other sports. I should note here, if you are a looking for a beach-front resort, paradisus is not for you. The pools were great and there was a beach volleyball court. The sand and beach area were not great. The staff and service was very competent and friendly over all, including one woman with beautiful eyes that my brother is still talking about. Some slow service in the restaurants but we had a party of 18 to serve each night. We were lucky enough to have great weather for most of the week. A little overcast and rain at times. The resort did get buggy at night and my feet and ankles were pretty bitten up all week. On our last night we were fortunate enough to catch the \"white party.\" A dance party where guests and staff (yes she was there) showed up wearing white and we danced and drank until the wee hours of the morning. A great way to end the week. My family's review was very positive over all. We all had a great time and I would recommend the resort.

Although it's a pretty resort and the employees were nice, I was amazed at all of the problems we experienced here, especially considering it is NOT a cheap resort! When we entered the room for the first time we discovered two light bulbs that were burned out which we had to have replaced. Also when we entered the room for the first time the message light was flashing on the phone, only to discover that is was a \"bogus\" warning, that the resort was having trouble with the message system. Then we realized there were no dressers with drawers to put our clothes in, something I have always had, even at cheap motels such as a Motel 6! Instead, they had shelves to put the clothes on which could not be closed such as in a dresser. During our stay there were MANY power outages, some relatively short in duration and some not so short. A couple of these power outages caused problems with the water supply to the room. One morning, after a power outage the water could not get any hotter than barely warm for the entire resort so I took a shower early in the morning with a water temperature that was barely tolerable. I was told that the power outage broke three out of the five pumps at the resort and they couldn't get a plumber out during the night so fixing it had to wait until later in the morning. So the water temperature was like this for at least five hours and of course, at a bad time when guests would be taking showers. A few days later another power outage caused the water to go completely OUT for a while in the morning for the entire resort. Fortunately, neither my wife nor I were in the shower when this occurred. I feel sorry for any guest who happened to have a head full of shampoo when the water went out! I checked my room charges daily and right at the begining I noticed a charge of $1 for UNICEF on my room charges. When I asked why this was on my room charges since it was not authorized, I was told by someone at the desk that the computer sometimes does this, as if the resort had no responsibility for this! I had never heard of a hotel doing something like this. One of the mornings when we returned to the room, our room card wouldn't open the door. Luckily, a maid was nearby who opened the door for us. We were told our cell phone must have caused this to happen. This made some sense until I discovered the other room card also wouldn't work, which had been locked up in the room safe at the time, far away from our cell phone! The resort offered and we did recieve a discount card named \"MAS\" which provided discounts at the resort restaurants during our stay. Unfortunately, for some odd reason they were unable to enter this into their hotel computer system during our stay, something that seems pretty basic in the age of computers, and they do have computers even at this resort. Instead, we had to provide this \"MAS\" card everytime we went to a hotel restaurant to receive the discount. One time we simply forgot the card so I had to walk back to the room to get the card and then back to the restaurant, the only way to receive the discount. One day while we were out I was expecting an important message from a tour company to find out what time they would pick us up at the resort the next day. At the time we were on a separate tour of the rainforest so we could not recieve calls during this time, obviously. When we got back to the resort I asked at the desk if there were any messages for us while we were out. The clerk at the resort desk told me there weren't any messages. As it turned out, in fact, there was a message from the tour company, written on a piece of paper stuck at the side of the door at our room. One would think that desk clerk could have at least told me that yes, there was a message, even if she wouldn't tell me what the message was! On our last day right before checkout, we were carefully looking around the room to make sure we didn't forget anything to bring back home with us, my wife discovered a plastic bag of old cereal from a previous guest. We know for a fact that many other guests while we were there also had numerous complaints about their stay at this resort. Some of these guests we talked to while we were there and saw some irate guests while we were in the lobby each day at the resort. We were in the lobby each day, usually for about an hour, because the lobby is the only area where free Wifi was available at the resort and we actually appreciated having this free Wifi during our stay. Many times while we were in the lobby we noticed irate guests who were upset about the resort for one reason or another, some of whom asked for and ended up speaking to a manager. Fortunately, our tour company did an excellent job on our vacation which helped make up for our multiple bad experiences at this resort.

Upon check-in they asked us what credit card we'd like to put a hold on for incidentals, seeing as they don't let you pay with cash ANYWHERE in the hotel except the casino and gift shop, we asked what type of hold would be done and how much, as most of our spending $ was in cash. The front desk clerk told us they'd hold $100 / day and we could settle up with the other charges in cash at the end of the trip. NOT THE CASE! Our card was hit 3x before we even checked out! When we actually did go to check out, we were first met by the supervisor who told us we should have been told if we exceeded the $100 / day , whatever we went over would be added to our account, and held on our card with the other charges until the end of our trip...except that was a lie also! We put down a debit card...so it AUTOMATICALLY took out any overages immediately. Luckily my husband likes to check our bank account periodically, and noticed the charges, otherwise we'd have paid twice before leaving today (and yes I'm so mad I'm writing this the same day)! When the supervisor had nothing helpful to say, I asked to speak to the General Manager of the hotel. My husband and I work in the service industry as managers (I'm a shift manager, and he's a General Manager) and when someone asks for a GM...you find one...Immediately! Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Next we were met by the Front Desk Manager who re-itterated the SAME thing the supervisor said. Our problem isn't paying...its being lied to by an employee who should know his job before telling people incorrect information that screws with their money! Especially on vacation...and even more so on someones HONEYMOON! I then asked for a General Manager again...so someone else comes out... I feel its important to mention now, that another employee has now confirmed to me that the \"blonde guy in the suit\" I saw walking around, is in fact on the property AND the GM...the person who greets me is not blonde or in a black suit...he's the ROOMS Manager. Before I even begin the conversation, the smarmy look on his face infuriates me, so I ask for the GM again...and am told a 3rd time, he's not available or on the property. We are then informed that they don't really care how we feel bc they've already been paid. GREAT HOSPITALITY.

The restaurants alternate nights, so you have to plan accordingly, and make sure you have a reservation, you'll wait 15minutes anyway, but if you don't have one at all, you won't eat...the food is sub-par...sushi was the only thing worth eating, don't bother with room service or the pool bar...its also annoying they only have one place to eat for bkfst and lunch, no options...", "title": "DO NOT GO HERE...THEY LIE!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "envs", "date": "February 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 124347901}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The one shining star at that resort...Richard the bartender!

I chose this resort based on my previous stays at the Paradisus Punta Cana and the special pricing I received. As all the reviews have stated, it is a beautiful resort. The room and bathroom were both large and well appointed. I did not expect the groomed sandy beaches because I had read previous reviews but I\u2019m sure some guests were disappointed. The food was always good, especially Avocado. I am not one to always plan my evening meals and would have liked the option of an informal evening buffet. We had no difficulties getting reservations for dinner however I\u2019m sure it would be a problem if the resort were fully booked. To our advantage there were few guests staying this week. I have read that getting people to come to this resort has been an issue and may explain the special pricing of my package. I do take exception to the negative comments about the staff in previous reviews. I felt the staff was no less than great. Special thanks to bartenders Efrain, Shirley and Alex, and server Vanessa. I did find the management team was rude to guests as well as staff. The tension between management and staff was obvious. This may explain some of the less than flattering reviews about the staff. The Melia parent company is also promoting its vacation club that has a building under construction at this resort. This, as well as the pressure for \u201cRoyal Service\u201d, was somewhat distracting. The entertainment and activities staff was not as I was used to from my many stays at other resorts. The entertainment was a singer in the main bar area every evening and the activities seemed less than enthusiastically promoted. The only major complaint during my stay is what will prevent my return and my recommendation of this resort to others. The resort allows day passes for guests, which in itself is no problem. The problem occurred when 70+ young adults (18-25) from Blockbuster Video converged on the pool at 10 in the morning and drank heavily until 5 in the afternoon. They were loud and obnoxious. When I complained to management that there was no oversight for these individuals I was told there was nothing they could (or would??) do. These guests had paid their $135 and basically too bad.

Let\u2019s start at the beginning. This is not in San Juan, it is about 45 minutes away from San Juan, but is very easy to get to. If you want the party/city life, you will not be happy here. We were fine with this as we have been to San Juan over 10 times and did not need to be in the city. The hotel was at the end of a long drive once you turn into Coco Beach/Trump Golf. We were well received and the staff couldn't be more accommodating when we arrived. I went to park the car and when I returned my husband was ready with the room keys. Check in took all of 3 minutes, very fast, the lobby was very well designed with all the restaurants concentrated there. We did not upgrade as we were traveling with our kids and the private pool at the red level does not allow kids. We received rooms close to the hotel with a kitchen and living room, which we needed since traveling with kids we had requested a fridge but this was better. Maybe these were not the most wanted rooms (not close to the beach) but they were the biggest and when you have kids you want these rooms. The rooms did not have a balcony but again not needed with 1 year old twins around. The rooms, 117 and 118 came furnished with a kitchenette and some dishes, glasses and cooking essentials. The only drawback was the rooms only had 1 king size bed. No double beds. We tried to switch one of the rooms since my mom and MIL were sharing and they were very accommodating and willing to move us but the rooms with double beds did not have the kitchenettes, so we opted to stay and make use of the pullout sofa in the living room. We opened the sofa and it was the worst shape ever, the legs did not even stand. We decided not to make a big deal of that as the space was more valuable to us than the sofa. My mom and MIL slept in the same bed since it was huge. The bathrooms were big but do show wear and tear as so does the rest of the resort. The breakfast in the morning was good; yes it was the standard breakfast at any hotel. We had our MAS card and only paid half price for breakfast which was $11. I think $11 for buffet breakfast is a good deal and they were very liberal with the take-away policy, did not care if people walked out with fruits or yogurts. The lunch at the wet bar (pool area) was good too, $10-$20 entrees, again right in line with what you would expect in a resort. The best dish there was the paella which is about $28. The burgers were ok nothing to write home about. I think they could use more diversity for lunch, as that was the only place open. I would love for them to have a lunch buffet or some other a la carte restaurant open for lunch. The drinks were not bad at $8.50, had the standard resort drinks and depending which bar you ordered them from the liquor content changed. The pool was good, big with plenty of shade and plenty of Bali beds. I did not have a problem with the music until the weekend and then they had a live DJ which was a bit loud so I moved further out to a spot on the pool that was more remote. The Bali beds, $25 per day, but it seemed anyone could just hope on them as no one was checking and a couple of times I had to tell people I had them reserved for the day as they were there when I arrived, no matter what bed you got you always got the sun during some part of the day. They should really put up shades to them. Sometimes they were made up for you if you reserved them but mostly I was given the sheets to do it myself. I think a bit of customer service in this area would have gone a long way. My favorites were #13, #14 and #16. Close to the kid\u2019s pool and the bathroom, restaurants. The beach was ok, rocky but plenty to walk and get your own spot. The night restaurants, we only ate at the Puerto Rican one and the food was delicious and plentiful, no complaints and no I did not think it was expensive, dinner for two with wine/beer $78. However the waitress there forgot everything we ordered and came back twice to get our order... We order mofongo, she took the order came back to drop off the drinks and asked us again did we order the mofongo? Annoying as this happened with every single thing we ordered. I took advantage and every time she came back asked her all sorts of questions regarding the area and things to do. Never ate at the other restaurants but they look cute, with tables near the water inside the lobby, very cute setup. We order their pizza service from our room once and it came pretty quickly but the pizza was a bust, yuck, we had better frozen pizza at home. The market store will save your life. They sell everything from coffee/ice-cream to diapers and the prices were very reasonable. We ended up going out as we had a rental car and went to the supermarket, Amigo, 3 times. It is about a 10 minute drive and has everything. We loaded up on food for the twins, water and some beer, wine for us. We also went to luquillo and ate at #20 and Ricky\u2019s. Very good food at both places. Actually brought food back with us on one occasion which we had the next day for lunch. We also went to the outlet mall once.

We showed up at the pool and the waiter reserved one those beds right by the pool (cost $0). From listening to these reviews, we did rent a car and that was one of the best things we did.

I've been all over the world, and have stayed in many 5 star resorts. The Gran Melia is world class. The staff was amazingly helpful, the restaurants were some of the best I've ever been to in my life ANYWHERE!! The rooms were absolutely perfect. Even the beds were top notch with plush pillow top mattresses, down comforters and large down pillows. If you need to get out and roam, this is not the resort for you, as you are miles away from anything, however there is so much to do right there at the resort I can't imagine why you would need to go anywhere. If you want to rent a car, rent it at the airport, not the resort! They wanted over $300 for 4 days, and we ended up renting at Enterprise for about $125 insurance included ( after driving in Puerto Rico I highly recommend taking there insurance). Taxi fares are not cheap! To get from the resort to the airport was about 30 miles and cost $80 dollars each way, but remember, you're still basically in the United States. Wages are the same, and cost of living is very high here unlike most destinations in the Carribean, so don't expect to come here and rack up on some over priced brand name purses, because everything is priced basically the same as in the states. Through the resort you can contact a guy named Angel for some of the best scuba diving I have ever done in my life. All day tour for about $175 per person, lunch and beer included! Great value, great guy! Oh yeah, Donald Trump is building a couple hundred condos on the same property as the resort (Don't worry, you don't even know the construction is going on, this place encompasses over 2000 acres), and Trump also has two 18 hole golf courses (PGA tour 2008-2011) on the property. As I said I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to relax, be totally pampered, and enjoy some of the benefits of the good life. By the way, I read somewhere that the place was overcrowded with locals paying only a small daily fee to get in. This is somewhat true, but undestand that these people are paying abut $50 dollars per person for only the use of the swimming pool and a few of the other pleasures of the resort. A family of 4 cost about $200, so your not dealing with a bunch of out of control kids running around with one adult trying to wrangle them, these people are paying very good money for the day use only of these things, and are not a problem at all.

This place was amazing! One of the best vacations I've ever had and I've traveled all over the world and have stayed at many nice resorts, plus I live in paradise in Florida so great review is something special! As for Restaurants you have to make all dinner reservations when you arrive. As for Breakfast & Lunch: Mirador is outside and very casual, El Caribeno is in inside and air conditioned both have great food, a little more upscale. For dinner...must try Romantico...super nice candlelite dinner. This is the only restaurant that requires a dress code, ie: kakais pants and a polo shirt are fine for guys...dress shirt and tie is not required. Very Romantic and a must for one of your nights. Bamboo is a great Japanese Restaurants with Teppanyaki (that's where they prepare the food right in front of you at a table, what a great show) or you can do the sushi buffett. In between Romantico and Bamboo is an awesome Martini Bar, go there before your reservation and have a cocktail. They make great martinis...I heard great things about Avocado which is a American Steakhouse that may guests raved about as well, though I didn't have enough days to check out. All the drinks were top shelf...and since you're in Puerto Rico you need to try some Rum Drinks, try the Rum Punch at the pool and Mojitos are delicious. Don Q and Barcardi are the Puerto Rican Rum Favorites. If you get the basic room you will be so pleased, we had a king bed and it was huge...all rooms are suites. This was my 3rd vist to Puerto Rico and I would go back in a heartbeat. I didn't do any Spa Services but heard they were execellent. This is a great place to visit on a honeymoon, anniversary, or just a get away and even with babies/kids. And if anyone is getting married there...wow you'll love it, they have beautiful area for a ceremony.
