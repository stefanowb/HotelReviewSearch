The ensuite bathroom was very small but it had a large shower (no bath) and was fine for my needs. The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was spotlessly clean. There was also a hairdryer and kettle/tea/coffee provided and a small tv which had a range of channels including BBC1, BBC2 and CNN news. Breakfast was the usual continental fare of different breads, cooked meats, cheese and also yoghurt, cereal, fruit etc. The hotel also has a code for wifi access (just ask). As regards location, it is on a lovely side street near the park and less than 10 minutes walk from the train station.

There is no elevator in the four story hotel. The room rates go down as the room location goes up. We stayed on the top floor.

Breakfast is generous, good, and served until 10 AM (three sliced cheeses, several other spreadable cheeses, pate, cold cuts, warm boiled eggs, 8 or 9 sorts of breads and baked goods, cute, highly decorated cupcakes that taste like ladyfinger batter, good yoghurt with fruit, various honey and syrups and jams and nut spread, fresh coffee, tea, juice, milk). Really, really nice staff (all of them). Just a shower, not a bath, but a large one / well designed. No noise problems from any neighbors (above, below, or to the sides). Comfy bed (a real two person bed, none of those \"two beds next to each other called one bed\" that make cuddling so difficult in some Dutch hotels).
