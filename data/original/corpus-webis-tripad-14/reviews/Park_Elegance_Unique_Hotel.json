From the fake painted lobby, to the elevator that only held 3 people without their luggage. Our room, which was supposed to be a deluxe room on the top floor (7th floor) had worn carpet, torn and smelly bed spread, and a toilet that hadn't been flushed from the previous stay. The hotel safe was a box with a padlock which my 6 year old could probably hack into. The airconditioning was nothing more than someone blowing a couple of cool puffs into the room and the weather in Buenos Aires was approaching 90 degrees farenheit with 100% humidity. We promptly made our way back downstairs to check out of the hotel. After a 30 minute conversation with the on site manager detailing our displeasure, they were nice enough to refund our deposit and did offer us the services of their un-airconditioned business center (a small conference room on the 8th floor) where we were able to use their internet to book into another hotel. This hotel is clearly NOT a 3 or 4 star property as noted. They claim to be a \"Boutique Hotel\" and that is an overstatement in itself. The location is fair, but, you will still need to take taxi's to Buenos Aires popular attractions. The Kempinski group hotels in Europe are true Luxury finds! This location is one to be avoided at any cost! It should not be in the same category as their other properties!", "title": "DON'T Waste Your Time or Money on this HOTEL!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "ordinarygold", "date": "January 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 6568041, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Wear and Tear of the property", "disliked": "\u2014 Do Not Stay at this location if it can be avoided"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "An older, for the most part, cleanly kept property. But during our stay I had problems with the responsiveness of the staff. I paid an additional $60/night for a room with a 'sitting area' characterized in the website descriptions as including a sofa or loveseat. When we arrived we found our room had a single dining room style chair. The staff apologized and said they would try to get the appropriate seating moved to our room(we stayed for 9 days). An additonal dining room chair was moved to our room. I realize it was a busy week, and no other rooms were available. I suggested perhaps the premium we paid for the sitting area could be fully or partially refunded. I was flatly denied, their reasoning that the empty 6 by 6 foot area where the sofa should have been was the reason for the higher room price. No refund of any sort, courtesy meal in the restaurant, nothing. Our room air conditioner was not cooling the room enough to avoid sweating while sleeping at night. After two days and 2 visits from the maintenance man insisting we were improperly adjusting the thermostat, I removed the air conditioner filter clogged with dirt and rinsed it out in the sink. It functioned fine after that. Also, our room doorknob had the annoying characteristic of falling off. For this area of town and this money, you can do better with a bit of searching. The staff will be apologetic but when it comes to correcting the problem or making good on promised amenities, forget it.", "title": "Decent value, below average service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bruze", "date": "December 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6437293, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 The attitude and helpfulness of the staff"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Kempinski Park Elegance was a very nice hotel for our 5 day stay in Buenos Aires this past January.

But when we went out for a day around the city (not a very central location but lovely posh area and close to the subway that takes you into downtown in some 20 minutes) we returned and requested a change.

The rooms themselves were functional but very cheap looking. They felt more like hostel rooms. All white, cheap paintings, cheap bedding and a cheap television set although we got a good channel selection. The attached bathroom was decent but tight. Another important point; there were no irons. Apprarently due to a safety hazard irons are not permitted. They have an ironing service avaible but it takes 24 hours to get your clothes back. This can become annoying...The airconditioner is a neccesity this time of year in BA but ours was a small wheezy machine that labored hard to keep the room moderately cool.
