Many hotels are beautiful and have the perfect location, but this hotel has a well trained, friendly and efficient staff that makes your stay a pleasure! This hotel can and should be treated as a resort property, especially during hot summer afternoons. I'd recommend enjoying poolside sangria in the well decorated surroundings- very chic with flowing black sheer drapery (only some very low volume music would enhance the environment). The poolside services were fantastic-as we spent every afternoon there. I could provide countless daily examples of the staffs willingness and ability to extend warmth and hospitality. Most notable are the concierge services. The concierge was EXCEPTIONAL! He and the front desk team provided fantastic restaurant and sightseeing recommendations, and arranged tickets to all venues we requested. Not always easy, as in some cases they arranged for staff members to physically stand in line for some smaller performances we requested. They were also helpful in facilitating a date change on our train tickets, by sending someone to the station, so we could continue enjoying our vacation. That was helpfulness that certainly was above expectation and appreciated. Anna at the front desk was also a pleasure and extremely helpful; as was the gentleman at the front desk that recommend we watch the Spain vs Brazil soccer match one evening--we did and it was fun! I'd be remiss without mentioning the manager of restaurant (Sjour ) during breakfast. He's absolutely fantastic--courteous & efficient! I saw many complaints about breakfast services on trip advisor and was pleasantly surprised to see how wrong they were. Each morning I watched Sjour greet/seat and manage the staff to make sure guest were pleased. He frequently checked in with guest during or after breakfast to insure their satisfaction. Typically this is one of the most difficult positions in a hotel. (No one in my family, or circle of friends is in the hospitality industry. We travel 4-5 weeks a year and it's just an observation. I find that people complain more about complimentary breakfasts than anything. Frankly I find it annoying, as in most cases they wouldn't pay for it, but yet complain without reason). Anyway, it wouldn't surprise me to see Sjour become a luxury property manager in the future. The housekeeping staff is usually not mentioned in reviews. but in this case I have to note their extreme care to every detail.

Instead, we were given a credit for free drinks at their bar which we enjoyed. Our room was not big but it was bright and tastefully decorated with quality furniture and the most comfortable bed.

We are Asian American business professionals in our early thirties and felt this hotel did not provide us with quality service. Do not stay here if you do not look like your eighty years old and \"appear\" to be wealthy. (On vacation, we dress comfortably in sneakers and jeans.) The porter ignored us and in fact, walked away when assistance was needed with our luggage at the top of mini staircase in the lobby. I was standing right next to him!!!! This was the not the first, but the second instance. I was taking a photo and wanted to ask another porter for assistance. He was on his cell phone and walked away!!! My husband also asked to break a large bill and he was asked if he stayed at the hotel. As a traveling business executive for a global firm, it is the first time my husband reacted with a comment \"maybe we look too young to stay here.\" I never claim this, but I deflinely felt there was discrimination here. Ridiculous. If you are in the L.A area and would like to experience a similar hotel with Spanish architecture, you don't have to venture far. Try the Mission Inn in Riverside. We had our wedding there and the service was outstanding.
