The setting was so beautiful with the restaurant looking out on stunning hills and trees. The manager Steven was one of the most attentive managers I have seen and his young staff are a credit to him. Our dinner was beautifully presented and I had the salmon and seafood main course and it was cooked to perfection and the sauce was so delicious my friend \"stole\" some. I was particularly impressed with a young waitress who had to deal with a rude diner and she handled the situation beautifully. I spoke to the manager to congratulate him and his staff. I do not like rudness in any shape or form. In the morning we were served by Aaron and he was a lovely, friendly, efficient waitor who could not do enough to make our dining experience perfect. Well done Aaron. For breakfast I had the best ever kipper with a lemon sauce. The chef knows how to cook fish to perfection and they are many who do not. Our bedroom was clean with fantastic queeen single beds with lovely linen. I know some reviews say it needs a refurb but If you go to a country house hotel you are getting the full package of the beautiful scenery, superb food, lovely service and as long as my room is clean and the beds comfortable I am very happy. On check in and out the girls at reception were helpful, efficient and gave us a lovely welcome and farewell. Well done Gleddoch staff. Yesterday my son was at a wedding there and he came home last night raving about the venue.
