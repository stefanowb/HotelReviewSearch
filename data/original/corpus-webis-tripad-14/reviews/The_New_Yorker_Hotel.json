We walked MILES in New York so we needed our comfortable bed! The art deco theme was replicated in our room and on the landing by the lifts, in the lights and mirrors. We ate a couple of times in the Tick Tock Diner which has been reviewed by others, and that also was really good. Reasonably priced good food in a very 1950s setting. Although you could breakfast more cheaply at a local deli we enjoyed our pastry, fruit salad and coffee bought in the hotel lobby and eaten there - just people watching. The Tick Tock Diner is open 24 hours a day, and needless to say they do a mean breakfast also. The Concierge service was a great help sorting out ferry tickets, and all kinds of other tickets or queries to do with restaurants or transport. We found all the staff very friendly and approachable. The location of this hotel was ideal - about half-way between uptown and downtown and as we wanted to see both we were perfectly positioned.
