The hotel and and the staff are wonderful. The room was clean, nicely decorated, very spacious, and had many personal touches that made it feel more like home than a hotel. The thick soft decorative bath towels are a nice touch, and complimentary bottled water and snacks were welcomed after a long day of travel. Room has a minifridge and microwave. If you want a coffee maker, ask at the front desk and they will give you one, as these are not in the room. This is not a high end hotel with amenities on site, but rather a clean, comfy, relaxing hotel right across from the beach. And, restaurants within walking distance. Actually a nice change from the big hotels where you are just another person to fill a room. The service on the TV was a little quirky, but not a big deal when you are spending your day at the beach. The staff was wonderful. Dealt with several different people, all of which were extremely nice, and make you feel right at home.

It was very clean, fresh, nicely decorated, quiet, very spacious! Loved everything about it! Made us feel right at home.

Location is excellent - a few steps to beach. Convenient, free parking. Great restaurants in walking distance. And the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. We had to make a last minute change to our reservation when we got there and Paul was fantastic about working with us. The owners clearly take pride in their property and it shows in every detail.

Don't expect much more, though. The rooms have recently been renovated, so they are very clean and nicely decorated. I have seen reviews that mention private balconies - that's not here. Some of the booking sites say ocean view rooms - that's not here either. What you do get is very simple accommodations within walking distance of the beach. At times, it was very noisy, either because of traffic, airplanes, people coming and going in nearby rooms, or the wind whistling through the doors and windows. Oh, and the curtains don't fully cover the windows so don't do anything in your room that you don't want seen from outside, or at least get creative about how to fully cover the windows (I saw blankets, pillows, sheets, etc in other rooms). All in all, it's a decent place to stay on a dime, but I think when we return, we'll splurge a little for one of the places down the road.", "user": "R C", "date": "March 28, 2013", "id": 155873928}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent Place!", "text": "Really enjoyed this lovely spot.
