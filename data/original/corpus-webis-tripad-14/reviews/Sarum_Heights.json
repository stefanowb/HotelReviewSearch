The room (avon room) was lovely and the shower was the best shower ever - thermostat to stop the whole too hot too cold knob turning trials and very powerful. Breakfast was very good - cereal, toast, and full English with eggs freshly laid by the owners' hens. If I was pushed to find a fault I'd struggle and the only thing I could possibly think of would be fluffier towels - that's how hard I have to try to find fault.

It was a great find. Parking was easy, although there were a few steps up to the front door. We were soon settled in a really well decorated double room which had splendid views of Old Sarum castle and the Avon Valley. After a busy afternoon exploring the medieval city it was great to come back and relax with a cup of tea and take in the view. On Sue\u2019s recommendation we walked by the river back into the city for our evening meal and easily picked up a taxi back afterwards. So we both managed to enjoy a couple of glasses of wine.
