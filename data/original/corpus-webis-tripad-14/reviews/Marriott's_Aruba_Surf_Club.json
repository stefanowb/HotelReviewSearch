We are time share owners at the Marriott St. Thomas Frenchmans' Cove resort and traded in our week this year. Although we prefer the rooms at St. Thomas, we feel that the overall experience in Aruba is tough to beat. There are many good restaurants on the island. Our favorite was Madame Jeanettes. This will be a must visit on every trip. As previous reviews have mentioned, the Surf Club is a large resort. The biggest challenge for me was waking up at 6:45 a.m. every morning to get down and reserve beach chairs for my wife and I. Although I am not a morning person, this was not too difficult because we were both worn on from the sun by 10 p.m. each night. Our favorite spot was near the pool closest to the beach. There are a lot of chairs, but if you want to get a preferred seat, important to wake up early. After eating breakfast and working out, we would come back down after 9 a.m. The lazy river rocks. Although you can purchase tubes at the resort, we brought down a pump and inflatible water chair which I purchased at Walmart for $7.00. Only island that I have seen where people use the tubes in the ocean as well. Very relaxing. Upon check-in, we immediately took a cab to the Ling and Sons grocery store. There is always a cab waiting at the Surf club. Spent $150.00 U.S. for a week's worth of breakfast, some lunch meals, snacks, and alcohol. Not too bad. Overall, it was an amazing week. Nice to have the Ocean Club and Marriott Hotel next door. We typically gambled at the Marriott and the Hyatt down the beach. We are looking forward to our next trip to the Surf Club.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "BRITOPSPIN", "date": "May 3, 2009", "id": 29224165}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with family", "text": "My family and 3 year old daughter spent 8 days at the Aruba Surf Club.

If you are looking for a place to go and you have really little ones, this is the place to go!! I was really amazed that so many people travel with LITTLE babies. I'm not talking about children, I am talking about babies in strollers and/or in their mother's arms. One couple even had triplets, another had twins. It is hard enough to get myself packed for a trip. I applaud all those parents that can travel so far with little ones and all the paraphenalia that goes with them.
