We stayed in the \"Bathroom\" which is a very nice room but one that has only a glass wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom. The ambiance of the hotel is great as is the location; very close to restaurants, shopping, sightseeing and the subway. The breakfast buffet included is excellent.

Loved the rainfall shower! I had one of the large doubles which had plenty of light and space to move about. There are two restaurants on the ground floor and a popular bar. Nice breakfast. My fourth floor room was quiet and faced the street. The guest profile seems to be a hip, well-off crowd either young in age or in spirit, which seems to fit the concept of this stylish boutique hotel.", "user": "leon56", "date": "September 3, 2010", "id": 78135390}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful hotel, beautiful rooms, fantastic location", "text": "The only glitch that I can report is that housekeeping left an empty toilet paper roller (there was a spare under the sink which I used) and did not replenish the shampoo or soap over the three nights I stayed.

The waterfront areas are all being (or have been) renovated and look absolutely wonderful on one of the first days of spring, in sparkling sunlight. (A bit like Venice without the feeling that everytihng is disappearing into the sea). I stayed with a friend for barely a weekend at Story Hotel and it was a quite magical experience. You enter from the brightness of the street into a \"cavern-space\" discreetly lit and with (in my experience) always an eye-catching receptionist in the lobby to welcome you. To the left is a wonderful restaurant/breakfast room, while to the right is a bar with a rear area useful for intimate meetings(!) or quiet business discussions.", "user": "PaulLucida", "date": "March 21, 2011", "id": 100980973}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Solid", "text": "The rooms are spacious, furnished in a modern minimilist style, with pictures from a local art collective on the walls.

I think it might be an age thing - we are in our 50s (like sleeping aprox 6 hours a night ) and it felt like we were double the age of anyone else staying here. So if you want to be with the young \"in crowd\" - this is probably it.

I know it's not in any of the guide books, but this is one of the cutest hotels I've ever been to. The interior is very artsy, complete with original artwork that you can purchase. The toiletries are from Face Stockholm (so you know the hotel isn't cheap about giving you good quality products). I was traveling by myself so I stayed in the \"Super Squeeze,\" which is a small room with a twin-sized bed. I didn't feel like it was small at all. Plus the bathroom was still a decent size. It basically looks exactly like the pictures on their websites.
