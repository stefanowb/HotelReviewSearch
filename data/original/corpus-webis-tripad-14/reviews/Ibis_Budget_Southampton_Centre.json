Last year, we stayed in the Southampton Ibis and felt that it was not a particularly good value. On the grounds that a hotel could not be much more basic than the Ibis, this year we tried the new Etap that was almost half the price of the Ibis. We are glad we did. The room, while not fancy, had a comfortable bed (and pillows). The bath facility came with only one towel, but it was large and soft. The meager bar of soap was no smaller than that provided by the pricier Ibis. The breakfast, at 3 GBP, was a good value; indeed the croissants were freshly baked and quite nice. The staff was helpful, giving us some needed assistance with the luggage as well as getting us a cab for the transfer to the ship. In these days of the diminishing dollar, the Etap is a decent refuge for the beleaguered American traveler.", "title": "All around good deal for the money.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "VickyMcG", "date": "May 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 15763720, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good price"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I recently booked the Etap hotel for a stopover with my partner to visit family.", "title": "Basic but good value", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Paul Tarmas", "date": "May 6, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 15731674, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Value for money", "disliked": "\u2014 Smoking smell in room"}}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 57, "average": 155, "very good": 210, "terrible": 51, "excellent": 110}, "aka": "Etap Southampton", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 3.5, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Ibis Budget Southampton - the smart traveller's choice!
