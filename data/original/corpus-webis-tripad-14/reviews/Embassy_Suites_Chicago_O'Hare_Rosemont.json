For our recent Spring Break vacation with two kids (a toddler and baby), we spent the night before our outbound flight and the night of our return flight at this hotel. When traveling with the family we always try to stay at places that offer at least a one bedroom suite because the kids have an early bedtime. I booked a Park N Fly rate that covered 14 days parking even though we only needed 8 days because the total was a few dollars cheaper than the cost of the Park N Fly with 7 days parking plus paying cash for the 8th day. I picked this place based on (1) Tripadvisor reviews, (2) the availability of suites and (3) the fact that this hotel offers *real* portable cribs.", "title": "Good Choice near O'Hare & This Hotel has Real Cribs", "user": "Scotch99", "date": "March 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 14584464, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Having real suites with two separate rooms & availability of a real crib."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled on business", "text": "A note on cribs: my biggest pet peeve right now is the fact that practically 90 percent of hotels that provide cribs (that I've contacted) only provide Pack N Play playpen style \"cribs\", which really are not cribs in my book. I hate using them as cribs because the pad feels uncomfortable and my back hurts having to bend all the way down to the ground to put the baby down; also, my kids don't use them for sleeping at home so they don't sleep well in them. I always call and look for places that offer real portable (usually roughly 3/4 of a full size) cribs made with either metal or wooden bars. When I called I was assured that they had the metal type of cribs. Because we were arriving later than we expected and past the baby's bedtime, I called about 30 minutes before we were due to arrive and asked for them to put the crib in our room in advance of our arrival. When we got into the room I was really disappointed to see a Pack N Play! I called downstairs and explained my understanding and expectation of having a real crib with metal bars and asked if we can get one of those cribs. Someone called me back to say they ran out of those metal cribs, and I asked/pleaded that housekeeping please doublecheck. I was happy when someone found and delivered a metal crib about 15 minutes later (so we tipped the maid). The morning of our arrival for our second night's stay I called and requested the metal crib, specifically mentioning that I understand they have both but I really would appreciate securing the metal crib. One was in our room upon arrival. So the lesson for other parents who are interested in this -- make your request very specific if you want a shot at getting a real crib vs. a Pack N Play.", "title": "Great renovated rooms", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "silverthief2", "date": "March 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14378759, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nice rooms, airport shuttle, good location (also across the street from Convention Ctr.)", "disliked": "\u2014 Small lbathroom"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008", "text": "We had another service issue (lost and found) that was resolved after many many calls over the span of a week.", "title": "Good airport location and a Gibsons in the Car Park", "user": "Farnham_Flyer", "date": "March 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14219251}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Other than that everything else was fine.

The room had a very slight hint of smoke although it was a non-smoking room. I had to catch relatively early in the morning, and was kind of disappointed that I had to miss complimentary breakfast.
