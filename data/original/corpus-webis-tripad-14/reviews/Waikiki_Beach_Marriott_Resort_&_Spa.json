The hotel was relatively quiet, only one-third occupied. We didn't ask for an upgrade, being Australian, but after reading other reviews, perhaps we should have. I did request to be in the building closer to the beach which we found very convenient given we had a fair bit to lug to the beach each day. One of the reasons we chose the Marriott was for the pools but found we really didn't use them as the beach was so much better. Who wants to use a pool on a building anyway? The beds really were as comfortable as everyone is saying. My only complaint was the size of the bathrooms. We have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years but these bathrooms (we had two adjoining rooms) were miniscule. The POV was quite good but probably better on the Waikiki side and the breakfast package saved us heaps. The kids loved the waffles. The Marriott was certainly at the quieter end of Waikiki and we found the beach outside the Sheraton Moana to be our favourite spot which was probably a 10 minute walk from the Marriott. We spent the days swimming and touring around the Island and loved browsing the shops in the evenings. Great holiday, one week was plenty as we then had a fabulous week in Maui and I would recommend the Marriott although I would probably stay elsewhere if there is ever a next time as we love to try new places.", "title": "Nice hotel with very comfortable beds", "user": "Aussies1", "date": "October 15, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 2704599}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "best beds!!!", "text": "Very nice hotel, good location, Softest beds we have ever encountered.

Overall it was a fabulous place to stay. We got to check in early and had a Deluxe ocean view room that was as close to ocean front as you could get, on the 13th floor in the \"K\" tower. The view was stunning!!!Room was very nice and beds very comfortable!!!. Bathrooms could stand to be updated, but was nice, toilet was separate from sink and vanity mirror. The only problems we had was they are doing some renovating and loud drilling in the K tower on the 15th and 16th floor, not bad if you are out of your room during the day, but we were in our room for my sons nap time and it was pretty horrible noise. Marriott did compensate me by giving me 30000 marriott points. The only other slight issue with noise was the band from the Moana Terrace grill every night, but they only play til 930 and it is enjoyable when you are sitting on your lanai, but not if you are trying to sleep or watch TV. All in ll it was fabulous and would stay there again for sure!", "title": "Great Hotel!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "butterflyy2000", "date": "April 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 15196022, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beach location!

Between the great view of Diamond Head and the beach, comfortable king size bed, flat screen tv, well decorated, very clean, great service, and location of this hotel it was a great decision to stay here! This hotel is perfect for any NCL cruisers. We checked in the day before which made it worth while the next day. We went right to the Marriott check-in line when we arrived at the port. We couldn't ask for a better hotel to stay at before our cruise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We would stay there again next time we goto Honolulu.

We got a city-view room and were able to see the city and the ocean from our balcony. The spa is excellent, the location is great, there is so much to do in and around the hotel. The staff is great. The rooms have nice flat screen lcd televisions, huge bathrooms, and are super clean. Everything about this hotel was top notch.

Across the street from the beach and close to everything was great. We woke up to a view of Diamond Head and the ocean every morning and it doesn't get better than that! Hotel staff were nice and had no problems with service at all. The parking was pricey but convenient so no real complaints about that. Beds were comfortable, shower was good and the fridge in the room was handy. Kids loved the pool (they had a swim before bed every night). We requested a high floor so we didn't hear much street noise. The elevators do take forever which must be a common complaint there because they had notices posted about elevator upgrades starting soon.
