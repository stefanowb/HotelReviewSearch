The service was excellent; even though our air conditioning didn\u2019t work every attempt was made to repair it then adequate compensation made without quibble. The surrounding countryside is magnificent, the views from the bar terrace and rooms over look the man made reservoir. Without prior knowledge I would have assumed it was a lake rather than a flooded valley, the church tower peeping out of the water should be a slight give away. The breakfast is first class with lots of variety and quality ingredients. We ate in the hotel restaurant the two evenings we were there rather than drive some miles to alternative restaurants.

They're doing their jobs, not being your best friend as seems to be the task of American hotel staff and restaurant servers.) Trade-offs: it's miles from anywhere else, our room was a bit cramped and shopworn, the hotel had a distinctly unpleasant \"moldy\" smell when we first arrived, and the \"lake\" can send a rotting vegegation smell into your room when the wind blows the wrong way. (We saw nothing to explain why that was happening. What you see is beautiful.) Also, the restaurant was ovepriced and subpar in quality. We've reluctantly concluded that \"tasting menus\" at the paradors are profit centers for them rather than culinary undertakings, and the food (and especially wine) prices are not supported by the quality. (Drive almost exactly 2 miles away from the parador (there's only one road), turn right toward Fussimanya, and stay on that road (1 -2 miles?) until you come to the local restaurant named Fussimanya (Spanish, not Asian).

The reception area is spacious and light, and the reception staff are first class. The rooms are also light and spacious, with particularly fine bathrooms, which is a strongpoint of Paradors. Our room was restricted to an outlook over the Hotel yard and car park, but for a one night stay, this didn't concern us greatly.

The peace and tranquility of the place are particularly welcome after a long drive. Whilst the remoteness of the location offers such splendid vistas and peace, it means that other than a lengthy drive into Vic, the choice of dining is limited to the Hotel.
