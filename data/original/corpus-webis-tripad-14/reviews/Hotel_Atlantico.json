A very nice Department store across the street with a Supermarcdo (supermarket) in the basement level. The hotel has charm and is super clean. The hallways are nicely decorated.

White furnature, two nice size beds put together, flat panel T.V. The electronic shades made the room nice an dark and outside noise was not heard. As per other reviews the walls are rather thin and one could hear other guests or house keeping in other rooms in the morning. A suggestion is to bring a couple white noise sound machines which filter the noise and made the rest of our stay very comfortable. The bathroom was excellant. Spacious, Marble and Tile, dual shower heads. Could not ask for a more comfortable room. The staff was very pleasant and without a doubt I would stay at this hotel again. Five stars from me!
