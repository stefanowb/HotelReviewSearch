We arrived on Christmas Day and had to wait 15 minutes to check in because the sole employee at the reception desk was attending to the needs of another arriving guest who required adjoining rooms, which are apparently scarce at the hotel. More significantly, although the hotel offers free hot and cold breakfast, by 9:00 AM on the Sunday following Christmas, they had run out of almost everything. The staff apparently under-estimated the number of guests and ordered an inadequate amount of breakfast foods. No offer of recompense was made until we first asked for a discount and then pointed to the sign at the front desk saying payment was not required if you were not \"satisfied.\" The manager then agreed to \"comp\" us for one night. We used the swimming pool, which was clean and not crowded and had an abundance of towels. The rooms are well-equipped but, as expected with a budget-class hotel, the linens are not pressed. It did seem rather ridiculous that only one flimsly bar of soap was supplied for a 2-night stay for 2 guests. There should, at least, be separate bars for the sink and shower. We will give the hotel another try as it is convenient for us but it is not yet being run as a full quality property.", "title": "Not Quite Living Up to Potential", "user": "DCRE", "date": "December 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 52015093}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled with family", "text": "This Hampton Inn lives up to its great reviews. It is in wonderful condition: the lobby and common areas are very attractive and have an urban, upscale feel. They brought a roll away for our second child free of charge, they held our room without the credit card, there was an ATM on site, they had menus from restaurants that deliver to the room. Half of my family was going into the city and the other half of us were sick. This was such a comfortable place to recover. My son and I were left here without a car, and were able to have everything we could possibly need without having to leave the hotel. The staff was very attentive and helpful.
