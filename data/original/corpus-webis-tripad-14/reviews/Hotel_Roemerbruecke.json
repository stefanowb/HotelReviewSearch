First night was horrible. We then changed room and second night was good. Basically, if it's hot and you want to sleep with the window open you need a room on the river side of the hotel. Our first room was facing the main road and was very noisy with cars and loud youngsters returning from pubs and clubs. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly (speaking good English), and agreed to move our room for the second night. Parking for the hotel is across the road in a open car park so perhaps not that secure - although we had no issues. Breakfast was hot or continental self service and was good. It's a 10 minute walk over the bridge back in to Trier. The walk takes you passed some grotty (seedy) shops, pubs/clubs but we had no issues with safety etc. So a good if not great hotel.", "user": "Tickandbash", "date": "July 23, 2013", "id": 168765083}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This is a very good small hotel for either visiting Trier or as a base to explore the Moselle Valley and nearby Luxembourg. We stayed in a room facing the river. We paid 92 Euros for the room, which is 10 Euros more than the internet rate or the rate on the hotel's website. It was worth the extra money to look out on the river traffic and watch the waterfowl cavorting on the banks of the river. Our room was simply furnished but quite large and clean; it could easily accommodate a third person. The bathroom, although clean and well-equipped, is a tad small, but typical for European hotels. A buffet breakfast is included in the price and it alone is a good reason to stay here. It is simply lavish, with several hot and cold dishes plus smoked salmon and the usual assortment of breads, meats and cheeses that one finds in German hotels. The dining area is pleasant. You might have to share your table if the hotel is full but again that is quite common in Europe. A big plus is the free parking lot about a stone's throw away. A tip for getting there: If you come from the East of the city and cross the bridge, then turn right, and drive very slowly as the entrance to the hotel is in a narrow alley very close to the bridge on your right. The center of the old city and its attractions are only a 15 to 20 minute walk away. We did not eat at the hotel, but their menu seemed to serve representational dishes at reasonable prices. We could not spot any restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel, except a pizza shop, so one has to cross the bridge to find a place to eat if you do not want to eat at the hotel. For the price, the size of the rooms, its location, the breakfast buffet and the free parking, this hotel is a good deal.", "title": "A Very Good Choice For Trier And Surrounding Areas", "user": "Biorntraveler", "date": "June 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 163801223}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Hotel Roemerbrucke is a nice, comfortable hotel situated on the banks of the Moselle river and right next to the old Roman bridge at Trier. The staff are welcoming, the rooms are nice, very clean and comfortable and we had one with a view of the Roman bridge and the river - looking towards the city of Trier on the other side. The old city with shops, restaurants and the famous Porta Nigra, also from Roman times is is just a few minutes walk from the hotel. The breakfast was excellent with a choice of hot and cold fare in the elegant dining room also overlooking the Moselle. The staff had reserved a breakfast table for 6 of us as they knew we were friends from UK (although we were three couples travelling independently by car). Parking at the hotel is limited to unloading but the hotel have their own car parking compound just across Aachenerstrasse.
