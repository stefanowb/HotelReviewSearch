Quick search on the internet and found this guest house practically across the road. Great communication from the hosts to book which is reassuring. Finding it in the dark, pouring rain up and down country lanes was a bit tricky, as we decided not to follow the instructions on the web site ?? When we eventually used the instructions provided on the web site it was easy :) Lesson learned!", "title": "A Great English country guest house", "user": "Caroline M", "date": "March 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154926031}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Not to be missed", "text": "Judy noticed us arriving and came out to welcome us.
