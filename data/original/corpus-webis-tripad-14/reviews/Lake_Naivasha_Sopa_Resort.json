Just to start with, this was the poorest accomodation with the careless service in all the trip. As per the room itself and the service, I wouldn't rate them more than those of a 3 star/budget hotel. We tried \"Ashnil\" in Samburu and Mara, \"Flamingo Hill\" in Nakuru and \"Kijani House\" in Lamu, and the Sopa was, by far, the worst of them. It is not in the same range, although the prices are as high as in the previously-mentioned accomodations. The main purpose of this trip was to \"mystery shop\" around Kenya, in order to know the country deeper, as we run a travel business. This one we immediately marked as not to recomend to honeymooners (as there is not a value for money), and use only in the case there is no room elsewhere. In any case, it was was ok as far as we didn't have any problem: things were smooth, and the hippos around were charming in some way.", "title": "I RUN A TRAVEL BUSINESS, AND WOULD NEVER SEND ANY CLIENT TO AN ACCOMODATION RUN BY SOPA LODGES", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Romy_Fog", "date": "January 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 93523574}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "However, everything twisted when we DID have a problem. From my experience, this is when we you really can test whether a hotel is good or not, and this one failed. What happened is that we were stolen some money from my hand bag by the staff of the hotel. This can happen anywhere, indeed, but what makes the difference is how the management reacts after such a circumstance. In this case, they didn't respond. They didn't want to call the police, they treated us as if it was us the criminals (even registrating all our luggage!), and they refused to provide us with any compensation (despite they recognized their responsibility in the police statement). It took us 8 long hours to fight all the impediments they put in our way, in order to prevent us form getting a signed police statement. Only after our Embassy was involved they allowed us to go further, but then the manager simply vanished inside her office, without taking any care of the issue. Not even asked for excuses, or offered some water... Desperating. When we finally completed the police statement and left the hotel after loosing the whole day, there was no one from The Managemnet there... but the members of the staff that we identified as suspicious were working business as usual, having the chance to backslide with other customers. Unbelivebale. Our travel partner in Kenya, as well as the Staff from the Embassy, contacted the General Manager of Sopa Lodges for Kenya and Tanzania, who refused to assume any liability, and refused even to apologize, either by speaking to us, or by compensating us somehow. They really had no immediate interest, as far as the accomodation was pre-paid... Therefore, this is not a problem of their Naivasha Lodge only: it is a general problem of the whole Sopa Lodges chain. After this I would never sent a client there (even if there's no room elsewhere in Naivasha, I would add an extra night in any other place), and so I would recomend all my colleagues", "title": "Renovation + new chef needed, but Hippo & Co compensate", "user": "TDBBerlin", "date": "January 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 92993817}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The lodge is located at the Lake Naivasha (Rift Valley, 85 km outside of Nairobi, to either Nakuru or Masai Mara). We stayed there for one night on our way back to Nairobi. There are several resort/lodges around Lake Naivasha, this one is run by an Indian. The style is sort of old english /out of Africa with dark furniture and a huge bar / restaurant area. Open fireplaces are there, which is nice to sit there before/after dinner. It is less than 10 years old, but unfortunately needs urgently two things: 1. a big portion of maintenance / renovation (poolside, towels, plates, bathrooms etc.) and 2. a new chef. You only get full board in this lodge and wish you could go eat somewhere else. It was the worst food we had in two weeks time in Kenya. Its buffet form and nothing meets international standard. However the staff is very nice and trying its best to please you. When you want to leave your room at night you have to call security. The reason: 1 or more Hippos might just pass your hotel room. At night the hippos come out of the lake looking for grass to eat. To be honest, its very lovely to see a hippo walk by on his way for food. This is the good news about the hotel and the location. The security is extremely friendly and trying their best to show you the animals and explain their habits. During daytime you might wanna go with security down by the water and see many more hippos, waterbucks, dig digs, monkeys giraffes, birds etc. It is not a zoo, its nature, wild and the animals are just walking through the backyard of the hotel.", "title": "Great Location, Great Staff - Hippos on your back door - what more could you want!", "user": "Giovanna R", "date": "January 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 92557787}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was our first safari and this place exceeded all expectations.
