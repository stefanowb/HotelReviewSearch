It is a very charming guesthouse full of charm, character, and lovely people. Its everything you'd expect as an American. It is located in the heart of the Marais, but you feel like you're in a quiet corner at night. We loved wandering around the twisting narrow streets and sitting outside in the area cafes. We had a mini suite, I guess - it had a main room with a large bed with a view of the street and mini fridge, a large modern bathroom with a huge tub and a decent sized separate room with a single bed (daybed type so you could use it as a couch) with a view of the back. The furnishings look \"French country antique\" (I.e. old) but to my great surprise, that was a seriously comfortable bed. The lobby doubles as an internet lounge and library, which is pleasant.
