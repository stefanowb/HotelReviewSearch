Room was nice, quiet and comfortable, slippers, ironing board, international television, I ordered room breakfast, was punctutal on the minute. A drawback was that the telephone did not function when I wanted to contact inhouse services. Had a snack at the beergarden in german style, quite funny, the non-german waiters are dressed up in german style, and there is a large screen tv showing English football games. On the terrace and at the german beergarden service is quite slow, not very attentive.
