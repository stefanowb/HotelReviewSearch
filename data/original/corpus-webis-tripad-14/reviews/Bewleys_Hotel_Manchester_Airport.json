Then we saw the reviews of Bewleys and decided to stay there on a park and fly deal. You won't find this one on any of the airport extras websites, you book direct on the hotel site. It proved really good value at just over \u00a3100 including 8 days parking. You park in the hotel car park rather than having to drive to another car parking site which is a system that some of the other hotels operate. It's within walking distance of Terminals 1 & 3 and there is a shuttle service to all three terminals. Check in was efficient and the staff were friendly. Our room was comfortable although we did pick up the occasional bit of aircraft noise. It certainly wasn't enough to interrupt our sleep though and I am a light sleeper. There is a large bar serving a range of reasonably priced food and drink. The bar was pretty smoke free too. We booked the shuttle bus to take us to T2 at 7.30am and it was waiting for us 10 minutes early. The journey took about 5 mins and the driver was really helpful. The hotel does a full Irish breakfast for \u00a37 which we wished we had got up a bit earlier and had. The bacon roll and coffee at the airport was somewhat less appetising but virtually cost the same! Upon arrival back at Manchester I used the courtesy phone in arrivals to inform Bewley's of our arrival and the bus arrived within ten minutes. To be honest I can't really pick fault with anything. It was slick, effortless and trouble free, we'll definately use Bewleys again.", "title": "A hidden gem!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "SteveLeicestershire", "date": "March 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7184957, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good value, efficiency of transport to airport, location", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Thanks to trip advisor I researched this hotel before we went, and we were not dissapointed. 1st class hotel, great location, next door to the Crowne Plaza (which is more than double the price), rooms were great, very modern, clean 2 double beds, so the kids were pleased not to have a fold up camp bed thingy. Check in and out very easy. Booked the bus for pick in the morning, at the airport in less than 5 mins, same on way back, phoned and the bus came almost immediately.

Staff helpful, nice bar, good food, sound proofed rooms, wake up service. The main advantage is price and location as you can literally walk to airport terminal. You head out of car park cross over small road and head straight for multi storey car park. There is a free transfer service from the hotel and the car park bus dropped me outside when i had dropped my car off the night before my stay. I would stay here again and would certainly recommend to others. Its a gem.

We could barely believe our luck when this hotel fulfilled all our requirements. I had booked by E. Mail, speedy response made me certain that my booking was confirmed. We travelled to Manchester by train to find that the hotel was on our right moments before we entered the station. Made our way to Terminal 1, approximately 7 minutes walk, used the courtesy phone and were collected by minibus within 5 minutes. It is possible to walk from the station but heavy traffic flow means that you are in less danger if you are being driven. Check-in was smooth and efficient and within minutes of our arrival we were safely in our bedroom. The size of the room was impressive, not only did it contain a double bed but there was also a 3 seater settee and 2 easy chairs. Television, tea and coffee etc were available plus the usual last minute 'I've forgotten' things. Possibly the most appreciated discovery was that the room was totally soundproofed, no traffic noise, no aircraft noise and, definitely, no noise from other guests. The hotel boasts a fairly substantial brasserie, bar and restaurant. The bar service was excellent, the barman remembering our first order and enquiring if we wanted the same again. We ate in the restaurant and, once again, we were impressed with the quality of our meal. Many of the staff are Eastern Europeans who took great pride in their jobs and ensured that each table was well looked after. Our bill for the whole experience was, in our opinion, a joy to behold, our room was \u00a369 for both of us and our total meal bill for 3 courses each was \u00a335. We have stayed at many of the airport hotels, the good, the bad, the absolute pits and the very expensive.
