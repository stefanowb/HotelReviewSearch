It was a great hotel for a family. It was clean and the staff were very friendly. The food was good, too good!! Rooms a good size, shower a little temperamental but always hot water. How this hotel would rate in high season and full to capacity I wouldn't like to say but there always sun beds available around the resort whilst we were there. The cliental was mainly French and German but that certainly wasn't a problem for us, in fact it was quite refreshing. Most people where on all inclusive, we opted for H/B which suited us as we visited near by friends for lunch/dinner during our stay but I have to say it didn't have that A/I feel to it, nobody over indulging, and with waiter service, no people queuing at the beer pump!! If your looking for an action packed resort then this will not be for you. They have some evening entertainment and the staff are trying very hard to please, especially with the children. The nearest village is about a 40 minute walk away, so you would need to take a taxi to it or to get further afield. I felt that a week was about just right for us, two and I may have gone a little stir crazy. If your thinking of booking independently as we did it is certainly worth considering, I booked direct for 8 nights, 2 adults 1 child in double garden room at is cost 642 euro for all of us, incredible value.

Having spent a week in a small family run hotel in the old town of Rethymnon, perfectly situated amongst all you need we then took week two of our holiday a 20 minute drive around the coast to Iberostar creta Marine. We had booked Half Board. Met with a good welcome and room ready to move into things got off to a good start. Within the hour we were sat by the \"entertainment pool\", 20 mins later the music came on.. Very loud and not comfortable. Off we headed to a smaller pool which was much calmer. Don't get me wrong I'm 38 years of age and like a beer and a giggle but it was a bit over the top. Staff are friendly and good with the children, rooms nice and clean although be careful if you expect a Bungalow to be single story. We booked one but found it had a room above, we questioned this but informed we were in the correct room......so not a Bungalow. Swimming pools are salt water, can sting the eyes a little especially of the children. Creta marine Iberostar is situated right next door to the sister hotel Creta Panorama. The grounds are lovely and blend from one to another. Unfortunately for us we were placed in a room (with nice pool view) that seemed to belong to the Panorama. We felt like guests at another hotels pool when sat with our hotel issue towels which were blue unlike all the others that were yellow. The main block of our hotel including restaurant was actually further away than the other hotel......weird. The food was average, big choice so something for everyone but not excellent as I keep reading which is one of the reasons I'm writing my first ever review. We were also surprised to see we had to pay for Beach sun loungers on a hotel owned beach. Four euros each. Also twenty four euros a week for a safety deposit box to keep our valuables safe in their hotel. Wifi five euros per day!!!. Considering in our previous week at Mythos Suites Hotel in Rethymnon all this was free it is obvious that Iberostar now put more emphasis on profit making than customer service. You can get a shuttle for four euros return to the local village of Panormos which is lovely. Get yourself a table at one of the beach front restaurants and watch the sun go down. All in all we had a great holiday in Rethymnon, but would advise people of the isolation of this hotel and suggest visiting the island but keeping options open when choosing accommodation.", "title": "DEPENDS WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "Craig T", "date": "July 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 133334249}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Do do do visit the old old town of Rethymnon but be careful if eating, you will find food on the Venetian harbour is more expensive and not as good as it is a street or two behind.

Very good experience with the mini club team who are just perfect with kids (and French speaking). Animation team was frendly but not to invasive and the shows in evenings were of very good level.
