I have just returned from a 4 day trip staying at this hotel as a member of a touring choir. We all thought the hotel was excellent. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was exceptional - very extensive and attractive. The hotel provided a last night buffet supper after the final concert which was excellent and beautifully presented. My (shared double) room was large and well appointed, especially the bathroom - certainly not 'tired-looking'. My one small criticism would be that the reading light fitting set into the bedhead was placed so as to make sitting up in bed rather awkward.
