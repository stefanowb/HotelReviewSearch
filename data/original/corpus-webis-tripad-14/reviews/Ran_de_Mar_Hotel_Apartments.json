It has a good location, but the services were very poor. The apartment was very dated and equipped with old furniture / fittings. It is desperately in need of re-decoration and is somewhat grubby. We had a back apartmenet overlooking the pool which was really quite unnattractive. A street view would have been much more interesting for people watching. There is no reception, you have to call at the hotel next door to pick up your keys from a rather grumpy man on the desk. The apartment was cleaned only once in the time we were there (five days) and the towels were changed at the same time. Paguera is a very nice resort and there are much better places to stay than this. If you are on a tight budget you might not mind this place as it is very cheap to stay there, but don't expect anything when you are there other than a rather uncomfortable old bed to sleep in!", "title": "Only for those on a tight budget", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hesketh27", "date": "November 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10505534, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Poor cleaning"}}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 10, "very good": 15, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 7}, "aka": "Ran De Mar Hotel/Apartments Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.733333333333}
