These were excellent value as it allowed 2 people to eat to the value of 28 Euros each per day. This easily covered a starter, main course and desert on the public menu. Yes it does take a long time between entering the restaurant and finishing your meal, approx 1 and a half hours, but this is explained by the fact that the food is so beautifully cooked, perfection does take time. You were made to feel so special we looked forward to dining there every night. Sunday night was a gala night with special food and drinks included. There were 2 Portugese guitarists and a singer serenading us during the evening. A nice ending to our holiday! We were also pleased that although a public restaurant, dress code was casual, there were holidaymakers, women footballers for the Algarve Cup and travel agent delegates. One beer and a coke came to 5.80 Euros during our meal.
