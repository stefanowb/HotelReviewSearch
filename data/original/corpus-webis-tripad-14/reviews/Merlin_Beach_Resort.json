We have just returned and boy did we not want to leave and already planning our next holiday there. Stayed in a deluxe room well furnished and very clean on fourth floor overlooking the beach and pool, the pools are to die for and my husband was quite shocked as I am a shopping fanatic and I never wanted to leave the hotel as it was so relaxing. The staff was ever so friendly and went out of there way for you, ate alot at the the resort and didn't find prices to be too bad and the food was outstanding, the thai resturant there has the best thai we have tasted. Had a massage at the hotel spa (for 2 massages was about $100)was a relaxing surrounding which I think thats what your paying for but there are so many massage places around in patong you can't go wrong. Must say the massage girls down on the beach at the resort do an excellent job had a massage, manicure, pedficure and hair extensions at all very affordable prices 300 baht for an hour massage. As metioned before the pools are just brilliant and the pool bar is great happy hour was on tuesdays at the pool bar and the looby lounge with live entertainment every night has happy hour 6pm to 8pm. Had our wedding anniversary over there and the staff were excellent and with my husband organised a huge bunch of flowers to be in my room when I got back from elephant trekking with Richard.", "title": "merlin beach was spectacalur", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "excited05", "date": "September 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5802660, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, staff and the pools", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Being that little out of town was perfect as you were away from all the noise, hustle and bustle, some funky smells and the tailors who harrassed you all down beach rd.

We had a very good deal, where we got 5 nights free at Khao Lak if we stayed 5 or more at the Merlin Beach. We loved both of them, although they offer very different experiences, as Khao Lak is still very quiet and not recovered from the tsunami as yet. We had a deluxe room overlooking pool 2. Room was not huge, but spacious enough with king size bed. The only disappointment with the room was the shower was not as clean as it should have been. We asked for them to clean the shower door again, it was little better but still quite grotty. The rest of the bathroom was clean though. Breakfast was always great, but the staff were a little slow at times. We ate a few times at the hotel restaurants but were not that impressed with the food, especially the buffet. However, these were the only downsides. The pools were wonderful. We found the shuttle times into Patong okay, but we also hired a motorbike from across the road to get around. We didn't want to be in the hustle of Patong all the time anyway. The beach at the hotel was not great, as stated many times, but lovely to catch the sea breeze. The beach across the road was beautiful, and took a couple of minutes to walk to. We enjoyed many happy hours at the pool bar and lobby bar, and although the band were not that great, we still enjoyed them, they were quite entertaining anyway. We were there from mid to late August and were expecting it to rain quite a bit, but luckily for us we had only 3 days of rain in 14. Anyone interested in also going to Khao Lak Merlin, resort was on a beautiful beach, with lots of pools. The rooms there are more Thai influenced, lots of atmosphere, and much larger. But be prepared for a very quiet place, only one restaurant open at the moment, but the food there was great, much better than Merlin Beach. Staff were awesome.

Firstly is a long way from Patong or anything else for that matter. You would not walk into Patong in a hurry so this means the free shuttle bus that runs rarely or a taxi for 200 baht is your options. Then for getting back a Tuk Tuk will cost 150 baht.

However, there was a fly in the ointment - when we left the room for the final time to check out, between the time it took for us to go down in the elevator to the checkout desk, we were presented with a minbar bill for things we didn't consume! It took five minutes for someone, presumably the staff, to have a good feed on us! It really annoyed me, but we paid because the airport shuttle was waiting.
