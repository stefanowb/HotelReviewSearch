I did notice the hallyways had a funny smell, but maybe because they allow pets, I don't know. Half the equipment was out of order in fitness room...but I managed with what did work.

The biggest reason I chose this hotel was for the huge swimming pool and jacuzzi. I was willing to spend a little more for that. The pool was disgusting. It was so hot. There was pipping hot water coming into the pool (little holes in the walls). Therefore I knew that this was a heated pool. The jacuzzi was colder than the pool. Of course in 116 weather- I don't want to be in the jacuzzi. I do also have a pool of my own in Mesa. Believe it or not it is very refreshing even in the heat. Of course we go out in the evening. This is why I was so mad. The pool should have never been that hot. In addition the pool lights weren't working. I went to the front dest to complain as I saw a little toddler off by himself in a dark pool. Nobody apologized or seemed to care about this. In my mind (and as a nurse), I think this is a huge liability. What's wrong w/ people? I came back the next morning- no apology. He (front desk manager) just said that the pool has been having problems. If your just coming here to sleep- the beds are very nice, the room is clean and quiet- Don't use the pool/ jacuzzi.
