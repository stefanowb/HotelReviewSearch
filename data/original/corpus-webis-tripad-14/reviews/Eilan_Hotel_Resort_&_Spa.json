I had the pleasure of being accomodated by the wonderful staff that ranged from maintance personel all the way to managment. One staff member in particular by the name of Joe Lopez went above and beyond to satisify our needs and made our stay a dream.

The staff was overly accommodating and everyone we spoke with was so friendly and eager to help. Kimberly at the front desk was also very sweet and helpful. We had amazing couples massages that were the best we've ever had! The food and drinks at Sustenio were so unique and delicious and again the service was impeccable. The resort pool was so amazing we felt like we were on an island somewhere. The entire trip from check-in to check-out was beyond our expectations!! I work in the hosptality industry and finding a resort that offers so many amenities and the level of customer service is few and far between.
