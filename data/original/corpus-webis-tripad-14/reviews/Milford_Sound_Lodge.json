The kitchen is a madhouse at mealtimes, and although it was the best equipped kitchen I'd used in my travels in NZ, some of it could do with updating. It's hard to drain pasta in boiling water when it feels like the pan handle is going to fall off any minute. Another issue in the kitchen is children. Since the kitchen is separate from dining room, there's no need for them to be in there. The kitchen itself is is small and crowded, and having two seven year olds chase each other round the place while people are trying to cook is a hazard not only to themselves, but to everyone else there. I don't know if there is a no children in kitchen rule, if there is, it isn't enforced.

The riverside chalets are beautiful with a most comfortable bed. Kitchen well equipped, chalet beautifully furnished. As kitchen had no hob (but everything else) I went to main block kitchen to cook my pasta! This made the evening even more enjoyable as you mix in with all the other guests, from around the world, cooking all sorts of different things! It was misty and very atmospheric the evening we arrived but we awoke to beautiful sunshine and the breakfast trip on the boat (part of our package) was brilliant! Visit to the underwater discovery centre was also interesting. It's not cheap but worth every penny and gets booked-up months in advance so book ahead! There were problems with the road (landslips etc.) not long before we arrived so at one stage we thought we might have to cancel. As it turned out, the road was open during the day but closed from 7.00pm until the following morning which made it seem even more of an adventure, seemingly cut off from the world (at least for one night!!)

There were many sand-flies to greet you as you unload your luggage, we weren't made aware of the complimentary repellents. The rooms were basic but something clearly needs to be done about the soundproofing, we could hear our neighbours talking and laughing, we could also hear people walking on the boardwalk outside in the morning.. The stench in the men's toilet reminds you of Rotorua and the smell did not go away even till the next morning showing that no cleaning was done. At least spray some toilet fresheners ?? The pantry was dirty and the pots and pans needed to be replaced badly. It was also too small to accommodate the crowd. We decided to eat out at blue duck since the cafe at site did not serve proper meals. The blue duck restaurant was a huge let down as well. There was no free allocation of wifi either , this was the only accommodation that gave not 1mb of free wifi. The staff were helpful but that's about it.
