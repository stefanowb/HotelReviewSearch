For those that simply want to chill then the inclusive treatments ease any remnants of tension that may remain (which is doubtful). The resort provides a culinary treat throughout your stay with a variety of cuisine to challenge the hardiest dieter. If you've read their website then I won't bore you with any more of the physical highlights. The thing that makes this such a memorable holiday is the warmth of all the staff and the community feel with the other guests. There is a home away from home feel.
