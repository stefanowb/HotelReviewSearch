The staff were friendly and informative as well as available. We never had to ask twice for anything. Maybe the Yacht Club was understaffed for some reason when those other travelers were there - I hope they give it another chance. And, by the way, since our skiff sat only about 4 inches deep in the water, we weren't very worried about depths and such so the map provided by the Club was great. Of course, at times, everyone can be busy, and at this Yacht Club, the bar is the center of all activity so it can seem a bit hectic.", "title": "beautiful place, some issues to know about", "helpfulness": 36, "user": "cirrus763c", "date": "June 3, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3527316}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "SCYC is the base for a FABULOUS tropical vacation", "text": "Anyway, the surrounding waters are just unbelievable.

Went with the package plan and cannot beat the deal for whats included. The food is very good. But wait staff slightly lacking. If you remember you're on \"island time\", you may only long for a few more smiles from restaurant service. Otherwise, service from housekeeping, bar staff and management was friendly and competant. Having your own boat in which to explore Exuma Cays in all of their slpendor is remarkable. They'll pack your lunch for you and all you need to purchase is your alcoholic beverage of choice. I must mention, due to its remote location, the island of Staniel Cay charges about $65 for a case of beer. As we were a party of 2 couples, we stayed in the coral cottage, AKA \"the big cottage\". Accomodations were quaint and comfortable with the exception of Coral Cottages king beds,which are 2 twins connected to one another. Not included, which we payed extra for, was the golf cart rental which I recommend for island exploration , particularly Club Thunderball, and ability to travel to general stores.

I can't say enough about the clear waters, great snorkeling,friendly staff (esp. Rhonda!) and commaradarie we found at Staniel Cay. Been all over the Carribean and this place has the most beautiful waters and gorgeous beaches! There are deserted beaches everywhere you look. Did miss the television a bit for weather updates but yacht club has WiFi and TV in restaurant/ bar area. Wonderful food! The best lamb and lobster in the world. Food is much better then expected for small island with very little incoming transportation. Flew direct from Chicago to Nassau on AA and then Flamingo to Staniel. Flamingo was delayed outbound but very nice pilots and planes are not that small-planes have double engines, not just one propeller in front. Might stay at Sampson's next, but will return to eat at Staniel!
