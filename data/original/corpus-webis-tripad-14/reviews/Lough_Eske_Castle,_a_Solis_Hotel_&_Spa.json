In truth, the hotel lacks a bit of character as it's a bit too renovated for me - I can see the Americans loving it but felt a tiny bit contrived to me inside. Outside is beautiful, though, and the junior suite we had was the nicest hotel room I've stayed in. What blew me away was the customer service. At breakfast, a waitress spilled a whole pot of hot coffee on me - a bit of an inconvenience but an innocent accident. I made no issue but the hotel offered me a free overnight stay as recompense. This was above and beyond the cost of the inconvenience. Just booked in for a garden suite room for next week. Aside from his, had one of the nicest meals ever at dinner on my previous stay - perfect rare steak with brilliant accompaniments. Good value meal too. Highly recommended.

Our room was huge and very tastefully decorated, it feels brand new but nicely complements the old elements of the castle. The spa is fantastic and you could spend hours there just relaxing. The restaurant is excellent, food is delicious and great selection of local fare and is very reasonably priced. Great wine selection and also very reasonably priced. Activities are slightly limited so if more than two nights you may find yourself a little bored. You can play golf at local courses or cycle around the nearby Lough Eske. I would suggest the hotel install a large screen TV with good sound system in one of the common rooms and offer a selection of DVD's to watch, this would be great for rainy days, I know there are movies in the bedrooms but you don't always want to be locked away in the room.

The bed was gigantic and the bathroom was in a whole league of its own! During my stay the food I experienced was divine, I have never had such tender steak in my life and the staff were more than happy to help with any food intolerences or dislikes. I must say however the greastest element about this hotel is its staff, they are a credit to the hotel and are just beyond the call of service. I myself work in hospitality and try to strive for excellence which these individuals achieve and will go to any lengths to make their guests happy.
