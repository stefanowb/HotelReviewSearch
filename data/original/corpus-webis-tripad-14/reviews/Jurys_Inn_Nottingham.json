The stay did not start well with us not being able to find the hotel's reccomended car park. My partner called the hotel for directions but they were not very helpful and due to poor English they were unable to give us sufficient directions. We actually ended up in the Broadmarsh NCP which is about a 5min walk to the hotel and only costs \u00a33 for 24 hours. This actually worked out better than the car park the hotel reccomended as theirs would have been \u00a311 for 24 hours! Check in was quick and professional. Room on the 11th floor was roomy and fairly clean. Not up to usual Jury's Inn standards but it was ok. Slept very well and breakfast was delicious, apart from the raw bacon!
