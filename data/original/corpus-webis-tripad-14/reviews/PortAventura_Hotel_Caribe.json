Check in staff speak only limited English.Staff in general pleasant but some are quite rude .Rooms are clean and are certainly big enough for 4.now for the downside . the buffet restaurant has a good choice of food ,but we never had a hot meal there all week. the hot plates were just not up to the task. When we tried to have a meal in the other restaurant we were abruptly told that as we were on half board basis it was not possible and we must eat in Buffy restaurant even though we were prepared to pay .When we asked at reception why we could not eat in the restaurant we could not get a answer. Alcoholic drinks are not to badly priced 2.60 for bottle of Bud but 2.80 euros for soft drinks are a bit Ch'in the hotel all menus and information are in Spanish.The grounds are very impressive and well kept.

From checking in at 2.30pm it took until 10.20pm to get most of the items fixed. Phone cards that were purchsed from the rep didn't work in the hotels phones, and the floor in our room was only washed once during the week. The meals were absolutely terrible. Very bland and COLD. We ate most nights at the El Paso which had a much better choice and also the food was slightly warmer - one night we actually got hot food. The theme park and water park were excellent value and really enjoyed them, food wasn't too bad priced in the theme park. For this hotel to be a 4 star I very much doubt.

The hotel is the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in you could of eaten your buffet dinner off the floor. The hotel has the most amazing grounds that make you feel so relaxed after a hard day at the theme park. The beach pool is such a simple idea but the best pool i have ever swam in made you really feel that you were at the beach and life guards and duty every second of the day while the sun is out. The food was good and if you did find it alittle luke warm then pop it in the microwaves that are dotted around the dining room (simple) The theme park was very family based which was excellent as this holiday was a surprise for our 10 year old daughter she loved every minute and we never really needed to queue for any rides which was brill the park was also really clean no litter at all. The water park was also excellent and lots of fun, but one of the highlights was the beach club resort which was out of this world with the most amazing swimming pools and also no need to take towels as these are given to you at no cost as you enter. if there were any down falls with this hotel it would have to be that the bar staff we not very friendly but all the other staff were fine.

We had a wonderful holiday, the hotel and facilities were brilliant. The rooms were nice but slightly tatty with age, the bed wasn't very comfortable and the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything going on in the next room. Food was o.k but buffet restaurant served same thing all the time and it got a bit boring after a while, we never had to queue for the buffet apart from at the weekend. However you can swap your meal sitting at guest services and have dinner in any of the a la carte restaurants within the Portaventura Park and Hotels as many times as you want. The hotel and park are very busy at the weekend with locals. I would suggest booking a trip away from the resort as the majority of the locals are ignorant to say the least and have no concept of queuing what so ever. Personally we found the best time to visit the park was around 4pm onwards during the week as it was simply too busy at other times. The hotel provide you with express passes for some of the main attractions which came in handy. The hotel staff were always friendly and helpful and I personally thought the drinks and snacks in the resort were reasonably priced. You can get a taxi into Salou from the hotel for around 5 euros but it is really only a 10 minute walk. We didn't think much of the beach club, the pools are nice but the location is not so nice, very dusty and windy which made it impossible to sit on the beach as we were practically in the middle of a sandstorm!!!! I would recommed the main beach in Salou which was very clean and really nice, even though Salou is very tacky. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and the kids loved every minute of it.

There is no kettle in the room but there is a fridge,,, take a travel kettle. Room was noisy, from above,,, people dragging chairs and stomping about. It didn't bother me but I can imagine that it would upset others? If you're fussed, ask for a top floor room and if you're on the top floor, please be considerate! The aircon does't work if the patio door is open or when the room key is not in it's slot. Room keys are used for access to park etc, so when you go out, the room gets hot.
