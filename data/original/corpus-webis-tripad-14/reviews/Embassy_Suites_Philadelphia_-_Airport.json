Just about everything was of a positive nature. The staff is friendly and approchable. The nightly reception was good. Chilli and meatballs were served along with the drinks. There is a restaurant in the hotel which we did not use. We walked down to the Ruby Tuesdays which is close by next to the Hampton Inn. We had an early flight out so we missed the breakfast, but there were some wrapped danishes and juice to be had at an early hour. We left our car at the hotel and all was well with it when we returned. The hotel provides shuttle service to the airport as well as pick-up when you return. You must call them when you return and be sure to wait at area 4 which is the hotel area shuttle pick-up area. We returned at 1 A.M. and two calls were needed before we were picked up. My only complaint is that more attention should be paid to the grout in the tub shower area. There was some obvious mold growing on it in places. This is a problem that I find in almost all hotels regardless of the price range. There is no substitute for an old toothbrush and a little elbow grease. I would stay here again if I had an early flight and required secure parking for my car while I was away.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "sheltercove", "date": "August 15, 2006", "id": 5613880}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "As frequent Embassy visitors throughout the country, we expected certain things when we scheduled our week long stay at this one and were pleased with almost everything. The room itself was clean, although the outside shower curtain was very dirty and had to request a clean one twice before it was replaced. There was a 3 inch hole in the bathroom wall above the blowdryer and the tissue box cover had different colors of what we guessed to be nail polish on it. It should have been tossed and replaced but was overlooked. There is a little sign posted in the room to not remove towels if going to the pool as there are towels there. Each day this worked fine, until Friday night. That night my girls had to get wrist bands from the front desk before they could get in the pool and they were not allowed to take the towels out of the pool room after swimming which ment they had to walk (no running!) through the freezing lobby during the managers happy hour in only their bathing suits. I was not pleased so I spoke with the manager who said all the right things but didn't fix the problem. They attempted to stop my girls from leaving the pool with the towels the next day but I was there this time so they DID get to wear them through the lobby this day. I'm still not sure I would stay at this Embassy again or not...ALSO We took a trip advisor suggestion and we bypassed going to Six Flags in NJ for Hershey and had a great time!! It was not all geared for little ones. They had great roller coasters for the older kids and adults. Iit was clean and we felt safe. DEFINATELY a great tip!!!!
