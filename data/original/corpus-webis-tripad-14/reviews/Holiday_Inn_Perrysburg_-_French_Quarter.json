We were able to see rooms on the second floor and on the first floor, in the 1300 and 1400 section, and overall they were clean with some expected wear and tear (i.e., carpets, furniture) but some were quite small and did not have a few items most average hotels currently include: a small microwave or refrigerator.

Two, that same section includes a large indoor pool, the 'family pool', and that whole area smelled extremely strong of chlorine, even in the room. This is nothing I'd ever mention in a review as pools require chlorine, but this was exceptionally strong and did not seem normal (our travelling partner who we met there has been to over 31 countries said he never smelled a hotel pool that was that strong, which confirmed our thoughts). We both agreed that there was no way we could ever tolerate a room off of that area if that level of odor is the norm and thought it would be worth mentioning for anyone who may have allergies / be sensitive to strong chemical odors.

Kids had a ball but hard to sit poolside and \"read a book\" there. Attendants were vigilant. Ping pong tables, pool tables, and a somewhat run down game room added to the excitement in the New Oleans looking holidome.

We had about 15 family members staying in the hotel, and they obliged us by putting us all in the same hallway. The front desk staff were always very helpful, even at 1am when our room key cards suddenly stopped working (apparently they're very sensitive to cell phones, credit cards, and car keys, so keep them in a separate pocket!). My room was very spacious, with a King bed and a sleeper sofa. Our bathroom was a little cramped, though. This hotel features a \"Holidome\", which is something you pretty much have to experience to fully understand. It's basically a big room with an indoor/outdoor pool (with 4-sided basketball goal in the middle), a large hot tub, and a gaming area with pool and ping-pong tables. It's a GREAT place for kids, and there's plenty of room around the pool for adults to sit and supervise without having to get in the pool. There are 2 other pools here, too - a fully outdoor one, and an adults-only indoor/outdoor in the lobby area. The lobby area itself is spacious, and a great place to meet people or just to gather and socialize. On Sundays, they do a brunch buffet in the lobby area, and it's delicious, even if it is a bit pricey ($14.99 + drink when there's a Panera across the street for much less). The hotel is also centrally located to many stores on Route 20 - Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, Kohl's, Office Max, and several grocery stores come to mind off the top of my head. Also, there are several options for dining in this area, though you might want to go down to the Levis Commons area or up to Toledo for more 'fine' dining options. J Patrick's, the restaurant in the hotel, was very accommodating to us when we requested to have a party for a large group, and we all enjoyed our food there.

Boy, do I regret that one today. First of all, it being a holidome you'd think it was family friendly. There were drunk people every where. Drinking in the pool, the hot tub, and outside our room.

There was 20 people outside our room playing drinking games. Finally, I had to call and complain at midnight because I have a one year old who still wasn't sleeping. None of the change machines worked. The bed, hard as a rock. 2 am there were still drunk people roaming the halls yelling crap. I get home, there was an extra $25 on my bill that I didn't realize so I called and they explained it to me - so I decided to tell the girl about my stay in as nice of a way as possible - totally rude and she could not have cared less.

We went for his birthday, so I got us the King suite with jacuzzi tub. We decided upon arrival that we wanted to jump right in to the bath before getting ready for dinner. My boyfriend ran the bath and turns the jets on. When he did this large amounts of candle wax and pubic hairs came out of the jets. We were so disgusted, we called the front desk and they moved us from that room to another on the same floor. When we got into that room again we went to run a bath, when we went to look at it there was blood and some type of yellow residue on the tub. We cleaned it off on a white wash cloth and took it to the front desk. At that point the gentleman working was very disgusted as well, and again then changed our room from the third floor to the second floor, taking some money off our bill. We asked to have the tub cleaned before going into that room. When we got in their was a man cleaning the tub and asked us why our other room wasn't good enough. He was the same man that brought us a key the first time we moved rooms. We told him what happened and he promised this room would be clean. The tub was cleaned this time, so we relaxed in the bath, got ready and went to dinner. At dinner we we drank a few drinks, having fun we wanted to go back up to our room and go to bed. When my boyfriend removed the sham at the end of the bed their was what looked like poop streaks on the bed. I didn't know what to do at this point. We had already been drinking and couldn't just leave (although at that point I packed all of my things telling him it's time to go). Neither of us were sober, and the roads were getting bad. So we pulled all the blankets off and layed down. I felt very uncomfortable and unsanitary in the room. I told the front desk in the morening about it and they gave us breakfast, which we didn't even want.
