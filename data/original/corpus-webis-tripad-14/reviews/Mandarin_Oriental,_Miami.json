I then called the housekeeper to get them to bring me a replacement \"plastic hanger\" but was delivered a bulky wooden hanger. They later brought me a wire hanger, once again not what I asked for. When I spoke to the manager on duty he assured me that he would get what I needed but he never even called to say that he couldn't get it. I guess I was a little dissappointed since I am accustomed to the Ritz who will send someone across town to get whatever it is that you desire if they don't have it there. I have to say that when I checked out the lady at the front desk was very apologetic and tried to compensate me for my inconvenience. So FYI, don't leave anything lying around that you don't want to be thrown away.
