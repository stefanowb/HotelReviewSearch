If I ever decide to give this hotel another chance, he would be one of the main reasons. Meet him for one minute and he will remember your name, room # and what you like to drink. The social directors were great, and did their best to break ice when they could. But on the flipside, the lady at the currency exchange booth was awful. She seemed to be very annoyed that we would dare interrupt her daydreaming to do some work. Then she told us that we could only get $100 worth of Jamaican Dollars and wasn't the least bit helpful with any other suggestions. The staff at the all-night pool grill could use a little Red Bull maybe.

That's true to a point. Yes, the staff doesn't expect tipping outright, but they are fast to try to sell you things on the side. I had a bartender who would constantly try to get me to buy Cuban cigars from him, and typically at a higher price than I could have gotten them elsewhere. I finally gave in and bought one, which fueled him on. I finally stopped going to that particular bar if I saw he was working. Another problem I ran into was when I was scuba diving. I decided to check out a wetsuit for two of my dives, since we were going deep and it can get cold, even in the Caribbean. When we got back from the second dive, the dive guide informed me that there is a $10 per dive charge for the wetsuits. Nowhere was this posted on the price list for extra items not included with the resort. I didn't mind the charge too much, so fine, I'll pick up the charge. But at an all-inclusive resort, who carries cash, especially when the resort is \"cashless\"? I told them to fill out a voucher and just charge it to my room. I was given the dirtiest look I had seen on the island and told \"Mon, go upstairs and get some cash,\" and that they would be \"waiting for me.\" I don't mind making a little tip on the side, but I'll be damned if I am going to have an employee ORDER me to get some cash for him. The watersports manager was in the room when this was going on, so I guess no point asking for the manager. I wrote a letter to Couples corporate office regarding it, which was ignored as was the note I left for the hotel manager.", "title": "Great place to unwind and enjoy yourself", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "goodtimes75", "date": "November 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 48597073}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The food was good, but the service was, in a word, S....L....O....W....
