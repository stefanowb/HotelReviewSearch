The pub is located in the basement. They are open late and the menu has a varied selection. But, I like their hamburgers. The fries are usually fresh and crisp.

Great service and good food. Fresh fried calamari was excellent- so was the seared yellowfin tuna salad. Bob the manager was also very hospitable and came around to check up to make sure everything was going well. I'd recommend this place for a night out in Cranford.... - Lee", "user": "psycNJ", "date": "August 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 38146792}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Cranford"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 12, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 9}}
