Couldn\u2019t find it in the town and I tried asking a couple of old ladies sitting on their porch where it was. The only thing I could make out from their gestures was that it was somewhere outside of town. So, we drove some more and I asked a guy for directions.

The river is beautiful and my best experience was bathing alone in one of the natural river pools. There is also a small swimming pool if you prefer. There is a pleasant bar which serves drinks in the evening. The only disadvantage in my view is that there is no restaurant. There is an auberge opposite but we weren't very enthusuastic about it - OK for one night . The hotel is about 2 km from Corte town centre. We were happy to walk this but had to eat early in order to be back before dark. You could drive but parking isn't easy.

If you do not mind hearing the river (quite a noise but regular and undisturbing), you can enjoy some peaceful moments there, on the terrace overlooking the waters, under the big trees.
