The rooms are spacious and the staff friendly. This time we even had hot food for breakfast which was a bonus. I do agree with another reviewer though who mentioned the slow service as the breakfast bar was slow in being replenished and our room was not cleaned until after 5pm one day. These are just small blips though when you consider we were a family of 4 in a room for 49 gbp per night.
