This hotel was no exception - the room was very spacious, including a small kitchen area and a huge bathroom. It was clean with ample towels, pillows, nice bedding, etc. The location is perfect, really in the heart of Old Montreal. We parked with valet parking and walked nearly everywhere (although we took the metro once, very convenient). The breakfast was definitely one of the better hotel breakfasts I've had, with the exception of the weak coffee. But the selection of pastries, eggs, waffles, fruit, yogurt, etc, was excellent.

Rooms are pretty small, though we did get a suite with a HUGE walkout terrace that my boys used to play catch...a lifesaver!! We had the biggest suite there but still tight for a family with 3 small kids. Breakfast was good but crowded. Perhaps our biggest disappointment was Montreal itself. We're from Chicago and agreed they could take a lesson from our streets and sanitation department! We went to Toronto last year and it was spotless...assumed Montreal would be the same, but garbage and dirt kind of just laying around everywhere. Old Montreal was also quite dead, aside from some bars in the evening. Mostly TACKY trinket shops or businesses that seemed closed for the season (or forever?). Perhaps it was the time of year, but if that's the case then only go to Montreal in the summer! Mt Royal was nice, Notre Dame, Marche Jean Talon, etc were great. Skip Olympic park. Truly depressing.
