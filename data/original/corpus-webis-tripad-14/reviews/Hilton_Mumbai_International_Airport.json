They welcomed us with a bouquet. when we entered the room there was a delicious chocolate cake placed on the side table .... Felt really great looking at their attention to detail ... The room was very nice, spacious and artistically done. This Hilton property was earlier the le royal meridian.... so that explains the french styled rooms. beautiful wooden windows... which can be closed for complete privacy... excellent room service...... and ya a very scrumptious complementary breakfast.... The bathroom had a separate tub, and a separate shower area enclosed in glass...... the bed was huge with a roof or whatever you call it over it...... felt like we were sleeping inside a palace..... my only complaint with the hotel is the same as I have with all Indian five star hotels..... Include some more Indian dishes in the Room service menu ...... the view from the room was nothing great .... as lots of construction is going on around it ... maybe its a new hotel coming up..... this hotel feels like a palace ... you even have an art gallery to go and look at if you like art .... feels like you are in a very romantic place ... and ya forgot to mention this hotel is located very close to the international airport ... you can reach the airport in 5 minutes ... overall a great experience ...
