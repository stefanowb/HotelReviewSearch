We had booked one room with 3 beds and private bathroom and one with 2 beds and private bathroom. What we got was about half a house with a private access and 2 fully furnished apartments with kitchens, sofas, televisions, all mod cons.Everything very clean, right by the coast, close to a restaurant and the only shop/gas station in town for any amenities needed. Throstur, the proprietor, was friendly and very helpful with our questions, especially regarding our rental car. The location is convenient for outings to the south of Iceland, the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull glacier, the Seljanda falls, for instance.", "title": "Very comfortable, friendly small hostel", "user": "Bualabus", "date": "June 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 131800228}], "location": {"country": "Iceland", "region": "South Region", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Eyrarbakki"}, "review_count": 1}
