The directions given with the automated phone number misguided me and my GPS couldn't find it. I managed to stumble upon it by following signs for the Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts. I asked for a quiet room and was given a room on the 4th floor. This is a newer area of the campus and I could see the construction area out my window but it didn't bother me. I arrived late in the afternoon and left the hotel before 9:00 A.M., though. The layout of the room was very nice with a large sectional type couch and moveable ottoman. Huge TV could be viewed from the seating area or turned to view from the bed. The staff were very nice and welcoming. The only minus was the train.

I don't know how long this Hyatt has been here, but everything looked new and very well maintained. The room was very spacious, clean, and comfortable, with a nice sitting/desk area. The TV console had quite the input interface panel (if you ever want to give a presentation from your laptop in your room, you're all set!). The best thing is that the Hyatt Place has everything included - free WiFi, good assortment of TV channels, and free breakfast (unlike the more expensive Hyatt hotels).
