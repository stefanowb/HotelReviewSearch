The hotel is being gradually refurbished, once it is finished it will definately be worth another visit. This didn't affect our stay in any way though.

To get to the sea you have to go along a jetty (which is not falling apart as I have previously read) this is to protect the coral. It is a good idea to take beach shoes as the jettys get quite slippy. Once in the sea the snorkelling is fantastic. I have never seen so many exotic fish, absoutely brilliant.

Day time entertainment is centred around the massive pool. Water aeobics, water polo etc. The wave pool is on for 1/2 hour every hour, which was fine. The water slide was not working, but I am not sure why. As for there being no lifeguards, I really think if your kids are in the pool then you should watch them (lifeguards or not).
