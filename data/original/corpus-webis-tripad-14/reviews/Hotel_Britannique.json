However, while planning a trip to Paris for my 25th wedding anniversary, I wanted a hotel that offered a central location which allowed getting to and from main attractions with ease. Having a few doubts, I reserved the Hotel Brittanique for six nights after reading the many fine reviews on this site. I am happy to say, I was quite pleased with the hotel and its staff. Travelling to Europe occassionally, I found the room size to be typical. Hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff was helpful. I found it odd that the front desk only supplies guests with one room key and that they request the key to be turned in at the front desk each time you leave the hotel. The front desk did mention that rooms were cleaned each day, but if you decide to sleep in and post a \"Do Not Disturb\" notice on your door, rooms probably would not be cleaned after 2pm. Imagine our surprise one day after sleeping in and not leaving the room until 3pm that upon return, our room was cleaned and fresh towels were provided--having not said anything to the staff of our late departure. That is the type of service this hotel provides. It is located extremely close to many restaurants, cafes, bars, metro and major sites. Yes, there was construction being done on the facade of the hotel, however, it did not pose a problem for us even though we had a room located in the front of the hotel with a balcony. Most days we were out of the hotel before the work began and had no problems with the work crew. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay again on my next visit to Paris.", "title": "Home Away From Home", "user": "chriscrossin", "date": "October 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143056393}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were there for 6 nights and we really enjoyed our stay.

In all cases the staff was friendly, helpful, spoke as much or as little English as you needed and ensured that each stay was comfortable and problem free. The rooms are quiet and comfortable, but be prepared for the relatively small size of both the rooms and the quite comfortable beds - but after all this is Paris and you should be wandering the streets more, and in your room less. These are small rooms in most cases with limited room for luggage. The closets are good sized and have shelves and a personal safe to make sure you can take care of all your belongings. The showers are good and the water temperature and water pressure are adequate. If your room faces the street, you have a classic view of a typical small Parisienne street scene - especially if you get one with a small balcony. If your room faces the \"courtyard\" you will find it incredibly quiet and conducive to terrific sleep. Either way I have never had a problem with noise. It is clear the ownership is paying attention to the quality of the rooms and public spaces. Each time I have noticed upgrades to furniture, televisions, plumbing and the cleanliness of the overall hotel. The breakfast served is quite good, and very complete, but I believe it is currently 14 euros per meal extra....just something to consider if you are trying to manage costs. On the backside of the hotel is a wonderful boulangerie that opens at 7am and has great baguettes and croissant. Around the corner is a small grocery store so you can get some basics if you want to stock your hotel room with some snacks. The Chatelet metro stop is literally all around you, with several entrances within 50 yards of the hotel,so getting anywhere on the metro is a snap.

I was trying to find the perfect hotel because this was his first time in Paris and I had talked it up so much and I wanted everything to be perfect so I spent hours looking for a good hotel and this hotel got great reviews- I'm not sure why because usually trip advisor is right on. The rooms and bathrooms are really small- even for Paris standards. We were told by email prior to our stay that there was to be rennovations on the hotel and we could opt out but after so much searching we decided to stay because they said the rennovations wouldn't begin until 9am, but they began between 8:15am-8:30am, definitely not later than 8:30am ruining any chance of sleeping in. We were niave in thinking that it wouldn't be too bad so if you're staying here during the rennovations I do advise you of our mistake- it's BAD!!! It sounded like they were hammering on our heads and they were directly outside our window- but it was our fault for assuming that it couldn't be that bad or they wouldn't have still had the rooms available to stay in- don't make the same assumption that we did! We were so tired from being woken up so early that we would do our sight seeing during the day and get in after 5pm when the construction work was done and then we'd take a nap and then at night couldn't fall asleep until really late and this was the cycle our whole time there. Also, and this really upset us- the construction crew came in our rooms!!!! My shoes were lined up by the door and they were all dusty with saw dust and the window was a crack open so we know they were in there because it was shut tight when we left for lunch- on our first day there we checked in and then had lunch at the Zimmer Cafe which is across the street and is awesome and then came back to the room and noticed that they had been in our room and we immediately notified the front desk and brought down some of my shoes that were covered in saw dust and they said they'd tell the manager and tried to blame the maids, but I don't know why the maids would open the balcony door when we were told that no one was allowed to open the balcony door as the construction was practically on our balcony and our room was already clean anyway because we just checked in. My boyfriend was planning to propose on another night during our 4 night stay but because of this he was forced to propose that first night because he was nervous to hide the ring in our room since construction workers were coming into our room!!! and he couldn't put the ring in the safe because I would notice. The proposal was still amazing but I know he was a little upset with this. Also, the wi fi was down for three of four nights and because of it we were unable to plan a day trip because we were waiting on one or two days before to see if we were up for it and then we couldn't get on our computer because the wi fi was down and the computer at the hotel always had a wait since no one could use their wi fi. The hotel staff was nice but there are many hotels with nice staff and they weren't exceptionally helpful. The hotel is in a good location but really you can take the metro anywhere and we just took cabs at night so it didn't really matter. I'm bummed that I didn't listen to my fiance and get a hotel by the Eiffel Tower because while it's a little out of the way of everything you can get many hotels with great views of the Eiffel Tower, much cheaper than this hotel with much bigger rooms (I've stayed in this section many times before and thought it would be better to stay by the Louvre this time but the grass is not always greener!) and nice and helpful staff and you just take the metro and cabs at night if you want.
