We are spoiled and hard to please but we liked it! I really enjoyed the old time elevator which had a little sofa in it. The whole place had a nice ambiance. Our two room suite had beautiful ceilings and was nicely decorated. The location was perfect for me. It was on the other side of the Arno from the duomo and the major tourist attractions which enables guests with cars to get there without too much trouble but its only a 5-10 minute walk from everything. It's also nice, at the end of the day, to be away from the hustle bustle. I liked that guests had to be buzzed in. As women traveling alone, little things like this make us really happy and at ease. The breakfast was lovely. It's not just pastries. They'll make you an omelette if all that bread scares your thighs. Service was friendly and attentive. Whenever we had questions- they were kindly answered. Some high end hotels are skilled at making guests feel unwanted but the reception and staff were very warm here- another huge plus in my opinion. I really loved this place. My mom called it the mini piti palace which I think was fitting. They had nice bathroom products - Bvlgari (my fav!)- which smells amazing but considering we were two chicks with tons of hair we could have used some more conditioner. Thankfully we pack our own. While on the topic of hair I must mention our hairbrush was accidentally taken by the staff. I don't know if it was used in a voodoo ritual or was found in the dumpster but after asking the front desk about it (oddest question ever asked. Did you steal our hairbrush by accident or are we crazy??) it was returned. This led to many jokes throughout our trip and was a source of amusement. What happened? We don't really want to know. :) another oddity is the bathroom. In Beatrice, the bathroom doors were glass and as my mom was watching TV she could see me in shower. I'm sure she's seen enough of my buns for one lifetime. Maybe a curtain or frosting the glass would be beneficial? My only genuine gripe is the cost of parking. 50\u20ac/night is a tad scandalous. For the price paid, perhaps they could cap it at a much more reasonable 25\u20ac. I'm sure I'll be back in Florence soon and I would pick to stay here again. It was a nice and easy experience. Sure the place has a few minor faults but overall it's amazing. I got to stay in a palace in Florence for a few nights. I think that's magical. :)", "title": "An escape from Florence.", "user": "7continentsby25", "date": "November 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 144781908}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed our third stay at the Palazzo, just as much as the first two.
