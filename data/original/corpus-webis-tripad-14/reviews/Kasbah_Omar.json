Here at Kasbah Omar, that special someone is Karim, who seemed to be everywhere all the time with anything we might need. Kasbah Omar is warm and welcoming, from the unique decor of the individual rooms to the terrace where, on a culinary tour, we cooked while watching the sun set on our beautiful view of the mountains. Karim translated for our Moroccan chef as she taught us to make several dishes, escorted us to the Monday market, accompanied us on hikes and sightseeing tours and was just as charming and kind a host as you would wish for. Whether it was a wake up knock at the door or an extra bottle of water or arranging for a donkey to walk along with us as we hiked to the market, Karim was just phenomenal.", "user": "Wendy357", "date": "November 25, 2012", "id": 146137845}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best place to stay in Anrar!", "text": "I spent 3nts here with an Access Trips culinary tour. What a magical wonderful place--location and building. Close to Marrakech and all the fun of Ourika Valley, it's perfectly located in the shade of the Atlas Mountains. Nestled in a quiet Berber village you can meander around with ease. The food is wonderful as well. Kareem is a great host, I felt always in competent and warm hands.
