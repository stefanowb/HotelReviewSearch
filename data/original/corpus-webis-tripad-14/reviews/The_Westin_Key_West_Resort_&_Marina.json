It's right next to Mallory Square and Duvall street! We were able to see the sunset from our oceanfront room and restaurants were within walking distance, which was wonderful! Two cons - first, we had an oceanfront room and woke up the first morning to a huge cruise ship blocking our ocean view. The second is my BF is Starwood preferred and usually there's a welcome gift..

The hotel is fine. We were in the building which is not attached to the main building where you check in. Staff was nice. Can't remember the room # but it was quite a hike to and from the elevator. Not a problem for us but might be troublesome for anyone with mobility issues. They have an outside bar where you can get a drink in the afternoon or early evening but it was open for only very limited hours. Room itself fine, clean and yes, you will have your view blocked by cruise ships during the day. They leave around 5:00.

This time, I was assigned a very nice pool view room, right on the ground floor overlooking some greenery. It was nice to sit out there sipping coffee in the morning and cocktails in the evening. Food and beverage service pool-side was superb. The food itself was much better than I expected it to be. Having access to the sunset fun of Mallory Square right outside my door was excellent. Front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. The only complaint I have is that on the last day, although I had requested and received a late check-out, the maid apparently did not get that information and knocked on the door several times even though I had a \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. Although she was just doing her job, and was probably under some pressure to get the vacated rooms cleaned and ready for the new arrivals, it was not exactly the quiet rest and recovery time I had hoped to have with the late check-out.
