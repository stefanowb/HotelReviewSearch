Following our stay, it was clear that wasn\u2019t the case. As you can see in the accompanying pictures the lot was empty at 8 AM when we checked out on Sunday, and the reasons were clear. While the rooms were clean, they were highly worn (see pictures) and ours smelled of smoke. They claim they are a 3 \u00bd star, but that is only possible if it is on a scale that goes to ten.
