Paid the deposit back in November. Turned up to be told they had us booked for the carvery! The deposit paid was more than the cost of the carvery and we had a confirmation note stating a booking for Christmas dinner. It didn't need inspector Morse to work out they'd cocked-up. Jacob advised there wasn't enough food to offer us the Christmas menu! This is a hotel and we were 6 people. Was it really such a challenge to feed us. We stood our ground and eventually they offered a solution. Great, but next they seat us not in the main restaurant but in what I'd describe as the school dinner wing. Another quiet word with the staff and they move us to the main restaurant. Two complimentary bottles of wine are provided and the meal is offered at \u00a310 per head. A good gesture I feel and in fairness from this point forward the service and food is good. If they had reacted this way at the point the problem first arose my review would have been better. As for the hotel, I can't comment on the rooms but the downstairs areas look a bit shabby and in need of refurbishment. Their website sells an image that the hotel can't deliver.", "user": "Tickandbash", "date": "December 9, 2012", "id": 147082598}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Birthday party", "text": "Recently attended my friends surprise birthday party and they did her proud.
