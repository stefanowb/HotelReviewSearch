Over-priced and small. If you keep this in mind, you won't be disappointed at Hotel San Francesco. Our room on the third floor was very small and dark because of the small, high windows. Our room faced the main street and there was no view except scaffolding across the street. There was some street noise, but we wore ear plugs so that wasn't a problem. The furniture looked worn with scratches here and there. The double bed was very firm, which we like. The bathroom was large and very clean, as was the room itself. Air conditioning worked beautifully. Overall the room was good for sleeping, but didn't have much ambience. That suited us fine since we were hardly ever in our room. Other pluses: the breakfast was excellent with a broad selection. There was sliced fruit, pastries, cereals, ham, cheese, eggs, toast, juice, coffee. It was the best of the five hotels we visited. The service was excellent during breakfast -- efficient and very courteous. Front desk service was outstanding and also efficient though not what I would call warm and friendly. Max specifically was very helpful. Here are some examples of the service he provided/arranged. One day the hair dryer didn't work and after breakfast I mentioned it to Max at the front desk. Back in the room and just 5 minutes later, a temporary dryer was delivered and then later the entire outfit was replaced while we were out of the room sighseeing. One morning I was sick and my husband asked Max if there was an orange that he could bring up to me rather than a glass of OJ from the breakfast bar. Max said he would take care of it. About 10 minutes later, a lovely tray was delivered with a full pot of tea, toast, and two oranges. What a nice surprise and at no charge. Pick-up from the airport was reliable. Though we had to wait in a long line to get through immigration, then another hour for bags, the hotel's arranged car service was still waiting for us two hours after we had landed. We never called once to say we were being delayed.

There is a real attention to detail in San Francesco, from the regular bedroom checks and towel changes to the well stocked and fresh breakfast buffet each day. The hotel is small but quite stylish and spotlessly clean, and, if April weather had been drier, we would have been happy to relax on the peaceful roof terrace. A lucky find! Really enjoyed the visit and will certainly come again next time we are in Rome.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 5, 2006", "id": 5035149}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "If you're looking for a great free breakfast, stay here! The spread is amazing and the breakfast room is quite nice. The rooftop view is also great and the rooftop bar is probably cool, but it was closed during April when we stayed there. The room was a little dark and dreary, not much to speak of. The bathroom was small but clean. The shower was really a glass phone booth. But it had windows that opened out onto the street and gave a nice breeze.
