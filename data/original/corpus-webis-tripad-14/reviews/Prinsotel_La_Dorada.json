To say our stay was ruined within the first two days, would be an understatement. On arrival at 0100hrs we were told that our room had been given to someone else who wanted a move. After about 1 hour we were allocated another room and to be fair it was immaculetly clean, overlooking the pool, so I could forgive them for the mix up. What really spoiled our stay was the sandwiches we had from the bar on our second day. My wife has a habit of checking her food prior to eating it and on this occassion it was lucky she did as she found live maggots within the sandwhich. We brought this immediatly to the attention of the hotel manager, who after speaking to the Chef said \"Thanks very much for letting us know, you can have whatever you want from the menu\", my reply being \"Thanks but no thanks\". Suffice to say we did not eat in the hotel after this. To make matters worse, the sheets on our beds were supposed to be changed 3 times a week. After out fifth day I had to go and ask for them to be changed. The same happened in the second week, accept this time the maid, who clearly was not cleaning our room, gave my wife some verbal for complaining. In the end we cleaned our room ourself. Our complaints to the manager fell on deaf ears and at times he infuriated me. The hotel grounds were well looked after and the childrens entertainment was good, howvever if you value your families health I would avoid this hotel as it's cleanliness is purely cosmetic. The area around the hotel is quiet which is what we wanted. The local spars are v.expensive and the food in the bars is expensive and not particurarily nice. Our saving grace was the car we hired for two weeks which gave us the freedom to search out local cuisine and see the real spanish living as oppossed to Alcudia the Spanish Blackpool.", "title": "\"Very Disappointed\"", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JossScotland", "date": "July 29, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 18372279, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The first day when it was clean", "disliked": "\u2014 The maids lack of claening as the holiday progressed"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Good Points:", "title": "4 Star - I think not!!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TJ33UK", "date": "July 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 18199896, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Kids activities", "disliked": "\u2014 Food"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "- Weather was nice.", "title": "Was a picturesque, relaxing hotel- thumbs up!", "user": "ClaireyJ83", "date": "July 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 18165105, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 apartment was v.spacious and quiet location", "disliked": "\u2014 trying to get a sun lounger was impossible!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "- Good kids entertainment (under 7) especially the mini-disco.", "title": "Fantastic hotel", "user": "Tanora", "date": "July 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17819208, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pool and Accomodation and Friendly Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Location, sun bed availability"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "- Entertainment staff very friendly.", "title": "Fantastic Hotel!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "QueenVic88", "date": "July 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17561243, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pool, location & overall quality", "disliked": "\u2014 I will say the nature reserve as I cant think of anything else it really wasnt that bad but I would request a pool view next time!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Me and my fianc\u00e9e stayed at the hotel one week during august 2008, with half board.
