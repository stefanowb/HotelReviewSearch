Our butlers Dwayne and Denato (or Double D, as you may know them) were excellent and went way beyond our expectations. These gentlemen are two of the most friendly, kind and helpful men you could hope to meet. They were instrumental in helping my husband plan a special birthday celebration for me, and were never intrusive, yet always seemed to be there to make our vacation as stress free as possible.

We had the pleasure last year of going to the Sandals Nassau, Bahamas, so we were comparing the two. We're very relaxed people, so partying all night isn't really our style. Nassau was more laid back and relaxing while Negril was one big party. If that's what you're looking for, this is your place. We LOVED the snorkeling each day and the beautiful beach. We didn't like how close our building was to the noisy road behind us and we had to ask them to move us mid week so I could sleep (which they did and were very apologetic...very nice concierge staff). The food wasn't as good as expected, but definitely wasn't bad. Great drinks though and the staff was very friendly overall.

This is our second time at this resort. Last year we went to Sandals in St Lucia which is wonderful- but our favorite is Negril. We love to scuba dive. Its wonderful to get on the boat right at the resort, you don't have to take a shuttle to the boat. Emron was the dive master that took us on some fantastic dives(ships, airplanes, caves). Machy was wonderful to go out on the glass/snorkle boat and he had a fantastic crew. The grill crew love to pamper us (Julian) and have the best tacos n fries (Donavan and the other cook) What a fun crew. Charles was the new manager who took good care of us.

From the time we were met at the airport by the Negril representative, we were treated like royalty. The bus drive was very scenic, of course, and the driver was full of information and trivia about the island. When we arrived at the resort, we were immediately taken to an office and given the most wonderful tasting drinks, rum punch. We now LOVE rum punch! We had reserved a butler suite and our butler came to take us to our room. On the way, he told us we had a surprise waiting. Our room had been upgraded to a swim up suite. I wasn't sure what the room would be like, and when I saw it, I fell in love. The suite was magnificent. A wonderful bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and walk-in shower. A huge four poster bed. 2 flat screen lcd tv's. A patio with table and chairs and a river pool that came right up onto our balcony where there were two lounge chairs sitting in the water.
