Extremely courteous service always, and I was impressed. Our room was absolutely lovely. Huge bath, nice room, very classy. AND a small balcony that overlooked the ocean with two chairs and a small glass table with a live potted geranium. Very nice touch. Nice amenities with a small continental breakfast served to you each morning. Was on-time each day. I would definitely stay there again, altho is is a bit pricey ($250 + $13 parking).
