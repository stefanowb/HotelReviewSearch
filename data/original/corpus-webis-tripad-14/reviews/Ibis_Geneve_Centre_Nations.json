When we stated that we have indeed paid she disappeared and reappeared again in the middle of our breakfast and dragged us down to the reception. When reception clarified that we have infact paid at which point she was sort of disappointed and did not even have the courtesy to apologise properly.

The hotel lobby was nicer than many other hotels I have stayed in. The room was smallish but did the trick for the night. There is a number 8 bus stop right outside and travel is free for hotel guests in Geneva. Even the breakfast was good with amazing coffee. The staff were also very helpful and friendly. My only complaint was that it was over 30 degrees outside so the air cooler not aircon didn't keep things as cool as I would have liked.
