Good bargain price for NYC. Excellent location, just off 5th Ave and near bus lines, subway, small park. The rooms are clean and well serviced. The radiators are very noisy and much too hot. The staff is competent and pleasant. However, the rest of the hotel leaves much to be desired: hallways that were dusty, no place to sit when waiting in the lobby. To be fair, they were under renovation, but nevertheless, nothing was ever done to keep the halls clean, e.g. no effort made to empty the ashtrays in the halls or to sweep the floors.

I was slightly worried as I wasn't sure it was going to be great, especially as all the rooms are smoking. However, I was wrong. It wasn't the Ritz, but it was definitely worth the \u00a325 per night that my three friends and I paid for our family room. the foyer wasn't great, but who spend any time there! The bathroom was great, the shower was powerful, although some larger towells wouldn't have gone amiss. Also, don't forget your hairdryer. The room, if a little old fashioned, was clean, although very hot at night. There was an electronic safe in the room and the door had a deadbolt. The hotel is in an excellent location and as it is under refurbishment at the moment, I would quite possibly stay there again. As for the smell of smoke, it was barely noticeable.
