In this respect, the hotel is fine. The rooms were basic but modern. One thing let the whole thing down though, there was an overwhelming smell of cigarettes in what was supposed to be a non-smoking room. There was also no lift and having to lug 2 heavy suitcases up 3 flights of stairs was not fun. On the plus side, it was cheap. You usually get what you pay for and in this case it was true. But the stale stench of cigarettes was unacceptable.", "title": "Good price, shame about the smell", "user": "katherinious", "date": "July 31, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 116074498}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Frothy water", "text": "Arrived on a hot and humid night. Only way of getting ventilation was to open the window, which removes all privacy. Couldn't sleep properly because of heat. Not enough towels in room.
