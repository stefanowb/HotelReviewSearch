I would add a few points. First, small hotels, even very good ones, have too few staff, often recruited from the local community and not fully trained. Here, by contrast, was a large international team, very well-trained, so everything worked very smoothly. Housekeeping was immaculate. The spa, although rather limited, basically a sauna and shower, nevertheless provided my partner and me with very good massages after a long day on the fells. Our bathroom was very nice: separate shower and bath, good towels and robes, and bathroom bits.

We found the service to be slow on occasions eg pre-dinner cocktail orders, waiting for wine to be poured (annoyingly even red wine is kept off the table) and slow breakfast service although they were very busy for the latter as everyone seemed to come down at once. Most frustrating was that we were told at 7.20pm that the tasting menu had already sold out for that evening (they can only do a maximum of 8 covers of that apparently). Moreover the waiter's manner in conveying this was somewhat brusque and not meaningfully apologetic.
