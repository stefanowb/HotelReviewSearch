For a short visit I would have preferred a hotel in the Pelhourinho, but I think the Blue Tree Tower was probably more comfortable and less noisy.

We were staying here for 3 nights during the Brazillian winter/low season and so the hotel was very quiet (in terms of number of guests) and we were only one of a handfull of people in the dining room when we ate in the hotel.

The hotel is perched on top of a hill and a steep climb up from the main road below. There did not appear to be any decent looking bars or restaurants near by. In fact we heard from a local guide that you need to be quite careful if wandering about in the area and try to aviod carrying handbags, jewelly and cameras. A taxi seemed the only option to get around and would take around 20minutes to get to the Pelourinho district. Although the hotel has excellent sea views from the roof top swimming pool there is no beach at the hotel. The final issue about the loaction was the close proximity of a number of scruffy looking bars to the hotel which were quite noisy right up until 6am, so pack a pair of ear-plugs. These will also help block out the noise from within the hotel as all the floors are tiled which means trollies, chairs being scrapped and footsteps also create a lot of noise.", "title": "Great service, location could be better", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "traveling_couple_80", "date": "September 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3943597}], "location": {"country": "Brazil", "continent": "South America", "city": "Salvador"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 18, "average": 54, "very good": 93, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 46}, "aka": "Golden Tulip Rio Vermelho Hotel Salvador", "slim_ranking": 0.454545454545, "description": "Golden Tulip Rio Vermelho is close to all the best beaches of Salvador.
