The arched wooden bookcase behind the front desk, the silver room keys in velvet boxes, the cozy sitting area furnished with traditional Italian furniture. There is a tiny lift to take your bags up to your room where you will find a heavy wooden door leading into small room with shuttered windows draped in silk, a dark wood beamed ceiling with a small crystal chandelier hanging from the center. The room is furnished with Venetian style furniture but has a very modern bathroom. You put your clothes away in a polished wooden cabinet. Every detail adds to the charm of the small room. One marvelous feature of the hotel is its beautiful roof terrace with wicker chairs and tables and comfortable lounge chairs. When it's time for siesta - grab a pizza from any of the local shops and head up to the terrace to realax, eat ,and enjoy the sunshine overlooking the city. The hotel is located within walking distance of any of the important sites you want to see in Rome. We walked everywhere. The campo de fiori itself can be very noisy at night as it is a popular gathering place for young people. But the good windows in the Hotel shut out most of the noise except for a background hum and the occasional burst of song which is just Rome by night. The breakfast room is exquisite with its Venetian painted barrel vaulted ceiling, a beautul wood Venetian bookcase across the back of the room and traditonal small tables and chairs set with linen and china.
