They have a decent size kitchen for cooking, as well as an asado, and if you don't know how to use one, don't worry because they will help you. There was a sink both inside and outside of the restroom which was convenient if you needed to wash your hands and someone was taking a shower or something like that. The rooms were good sized and the beds were super comfortable. It was a very clean hostel, and I felt incredibly safe. There is a nice \"backyard\" which is great for socializing and meeting people, as well as eating meals. They do have a TV, and quite a few books to borrow and read.

I stayed and paid for one of the premiun room, with private bathroom and TV, which was more expensive. I am not complaint about the price, as I agreed before on that, but I expected better things. TV was not working, but I just realized that on my last day. No hair dryer on bathroom, while on the shared bathroom had one.The shower did not have a good pressure and water was not plenty. The owner tried to help and apologized about the tv , which was nice, but just my opinion, when you have a business like that you need to plan ahead and forecast a new tv before it broken down ( from what I understood, he already had thought to change it) and not think to buy a new one after that. I think if that did not happen it would be a nice room, as it was big and airy.
