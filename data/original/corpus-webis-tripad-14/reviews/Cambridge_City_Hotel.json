Friendly greeting on arrival and check in was swift and clear. Room looks like a standard box of a hotel room circa 1993. Beige and cream, box TV, dim lighting, zero character. Bed was comfortable, bathroom fine (more beige). I like sleeping with air circulating in my bedroom and you cannot open any window in any bedroom in this hotel, apparently due to the heating/airconditioning system. Feels like 1993 with no concessions to eco-friendly here, and I disliked having a window bolted shut intensely! The aircon/heating is fine, but is it really necessary 24/7 all year round? We were warned that if you turn it off the room gets very stuffy. Having said that, street outside got noisy on a Saturday night so may have some advantages.", "title": "great location but dated", "user": "Mrs C", "date": "March 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154176167}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We got a deal at \u00a3125 for a double, but even so I think over priced for a hotel with all the soul of a Travel Lodge.

I was travelling with my husband and children. Jane Jones in reservations began what was all in all a fantastic experience. We were greeted by Ruby and Ance on reception who checked us in early as there was a room available -this made a huge difference as our young children could take a rest after an early flight. They both then helped me find a suitable local hairdressor as well as help get a parcel posted. I just found no request \"was an issue\". At breakfast we were greeted so warmly by Fiona Simms who seems to be able to manage large groups with the slightest of ease and make everyone feel welcome and their various needs met immediately. On several occasions she rearranged tables to accomodate our friends joining us for breakast. Again no request was an issue. The room was cleaned daily and was lovely to come back to a freshly made up room. The location is superb-right beside John Lewis and the main shopping area, 2 mins walk to Jamie Oliver's Italien restaurant and within a few minutes walk to several of Cambridge's amazing colleges. Our friends came to stay in the hotel as well and they had an equally positive experience. So yes while its not new, its very clean and the staff go out of their way to be helpful to their guests. It would be No 1. on my list when I'm back in Cambridge again and I have also recommended it to my friends.", "title": "Over priced and poor value for money", "user": "FTG1513", "date": "March 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 153576769}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013", "text": "This hotel is significantly overpriced for what you receive.

Comfortable, very central hotel. Rooms are reasonably large, and the housekeeping staff do a very good job albeit on somewhat tired rooms. (Refurbishment commences later this year. ) Staff are very helpful and friendly, although the whole of the dining room staff seem to have changed, and many were still appeared on a learning curve. If you can get breakfast included as part of your package then it is very good value, (normally only seems to be about an extra \u00a35 per person) with a vast selection on display, and anything else available to order. Public areas are very large and are good to relax in. In terms of rooms it is a bit of a trade off whether you would prefer an outside window, which can be noisy in terms of students at night/traffic etc, or an interior room overlooking the atrium, which are surprisingly quiet, but some may find slightly claustrophobic. A few niggles; wired internet or wifi is not free in the rooms (costs \u00a310 for 24 hours). In this day and age I think guests expect to have free access to the internet. It's free in the Irish Pub which is part of the hotel, so not making it available in the rooms seems churlish. Reading lights are not particularly good; I know most people use screens/computers, but if you plan to do any reading then you might want to ask reception to provide a couple of desk lights when making your reservation. And curiously, there is nothing in the room about the hotel or services; obviously you can pick up the phone and ask reception, but a hotel guide is usual and quite useful. Rooms have very good refreshment trays, and are provided with a trouser press and iron/ironing board. Toiletries in the bathroom are generously sized. Car parking is priced at \u00a318 per day but although this sounds a lot it is pretty good for central Cambridge, and you can get your car washed for \u00a35, which is a bit of a bargain!
