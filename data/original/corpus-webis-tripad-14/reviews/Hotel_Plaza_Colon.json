While we were their the first time we tried to make a reservation for the second stay and they were full. Talked to the resevation manager (Jo An - not Joan) and he was able to 'move things around' and find us a room. Also, want to point this out (talk about service) - I was having trouble with wi-fi. I was trying to send an e-mail to Jo An and later found him in the busines center. Anyway, in the meantime Carlos the bell boy realized that I was having a problem with the wi fi and he gets the IT lady to the room to set up the router in the room itself so I can get a better signal. Since I had already accomplished what I wanted I did not need it. To me this is what you call going the extra mile.

I like to be very thorough. After reading reviews and speaking to some locals that I know, we ended up here. It was absolutely a fantastic stay from start to finish. First, when booking, I was a little frightened about giving my credit card info before the stay through email/fax. No worries there - everything is on the up and up with this hotel. I specifically requested a park view balcony room and would not recommend anything else. Whatever the (small) extra charge is, it is worth every penny. Through my initial interactions with the hotel, I requested that they arrange my transportation to the hotel from MGA. That was the best decision we could have made! They booked us through Paxeos and we were met as soon as we got off the plane with a representative holding a sign with our name. They guided us through customs, getting our luggage, and got us right into a vehicle with our driver. We were in and out in less than 10 minutes. Also, having not been to this airport before, it is not like your American airport with large stations for shuttles or other things.
