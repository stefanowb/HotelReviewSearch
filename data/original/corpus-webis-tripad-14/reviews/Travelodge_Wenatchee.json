The room was clean, the pool was nice, so I gave them extra stars for that. The guy that works here is equally rude. Didnt want to give us extra towels after the kids went to the pool.

New flat screen TVs. Door didn't close properly, so we had to jam a brochure in the latch to keep the traffic noise down and heat in the room. Breakfast was very minimal, but was replenished while we were there. How about some fresh fruit (Apples from Wenatchee?!?) Not too fond of the breakfast being located right at the front desk. \"Renovations\" were in-progress, with half a tiled floor completed, which I tripped over, due to the uneven surface. Same in the ice machine room, with a 1-inch surface difference. Concrete stairs and railings had seen better days and need to be repaired or replaced. The place needs a good power washing.
