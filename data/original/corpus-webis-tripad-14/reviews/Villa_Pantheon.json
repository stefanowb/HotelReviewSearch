We had to go into the bathroom to read the map! The French window gave on to the courtyard so could not be left open, it had frosted glass so we could not see out of it and a brownish net curtain. The bedcover was slightly torn, the wallpaper was peeling in places. I immediately asked (in French) for a room with a proper window, light and a view. I was told that we MIGHT be able to change rooms the next day. The next morning I repeated my request and we were given a much better room on the 5th floor with a little balcony, overlooking the street.

Between us we had a double and two single rooms. All of us really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and our rooms were all clean, modern, well maintained and pretty typical of Parisian hotels size wise (i.e. the rooms are a bit bijou compared to the sorts of rooms common in places like the US). Our double room had a large and extremely comfortable double bed and, as we are of an 'average' size, it was perfectly big enough for us. The breakfast was actually pretty good in our opinion, with continental plus bacon, eggs and sausage - and excellent fresh bread and pastries. The staff were very friendly by French standards. As reasonable as the hotel is, by far the best thing is the brillinat location. It's a short walk to Notre Dame and the Latin Quarter but is on a very quiet back road, so there is no traffic noise at all. We faced the inner courtyard and were not disturbed at all. The hotel provided us with an excellent base to explore the city on foot and we a would all definitely stay there again. The cafe across the road is excellent for a pannini and a coffee after a long yomp. I can also recommend a bar called zig-zag, which you can get to by going right out of the hotel and right at the corner, then up a short walk towards the Pantheon (which is also well worth visiting.
