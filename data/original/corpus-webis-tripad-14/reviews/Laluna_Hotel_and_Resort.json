The buildings were attractive, very clean and well-maintained. The tropical garden setting was simply beautiful. We have a lovely, spacious room and bathroom. The breakfasts were great and the laundry service excellent. The restaurant food was more expensive than street food but that was to be expected however overall we consider this hotel to be great value for money. The hotel was a short distance from the main town centre but we enjoyed the local way of travel in tuk-tuks and songthaews. Unfortuantely we didn't have time to use the swimming pool but it did look very inviting.The staff at the reception desk and in the restaurant were attentive and friendly and looked after us so very well.

From the begining. Drove in through the very impressive enterance to the reception area. This looks very promissing. Reception staff were very polite and proffessional. Had booked a poolside room and a fair walk through the hotel gardens to gain access to the room. The gardens and lay-out of the Hotel are very well appointed, I'm thinking this is a 4 Star aspect. Shown into my room which was very spacious, very well appointed, tidy and spotlessly clean with 1 of the biggest beds I have seen. Wall mounted flat screen TV and a bigger than normal fridge. Table and chairs near the window that look out to the pool which is very adequate in size - in fact big. Arrived about lunchtime and headed straight to the Hotel Restuarant. Meal was priced as you would expect from a Resort Hotel. Chicken Snitzle and French Fries in the 350 baht range. It was huge and I could only eat half. It was of a high standard. Again 4 Star quality. All downhill from here other than the bed on the first night. It was comfortable. However, I require good aircon and its location within the room wasn't quite right. I ended up the first night, swinging the pillow around and sleeping at the foot of the bed just to feel cool & comfortable. The aircon was very noisy and you could hear the thermostat kicking in and out all night. Woke up in the morning and I always have to have a coffee fix starter. Water into the jug provided by the Hotel, but hello........ no coffee ot even tea bags. Nothing. Just a jug and 2 cups provided. Whats the point.???? Bring your own !!!!!! No i didn't. So I will shower and go to the free buffet breakfast provided within the price and try and get my overdose of coffee there. The Shower - Had to wait about 10 minutes before any hot water arrived. I was finished by that time. Quickly to the breakfast area and poured 2 cups of coffee before I eat. Bummer !!!!!!! The coffee was the worst coffee I have ever - in my life - tried to drink. I couldn't. Had to get a cup of tea, at least the Liptons was palatable. Oh please Laluna, you have to do something about that coffee. Nothing in the room and you cannot drink what's at the Buffet Breakfast. 0/10 for the lack of a good brew first thing in the morning. Now the breakfast. Just the typical bay maree style of half raw fried eggs or rubber like scrambled eggs. Huge selection of all other products that cater for a variety of nationalities. No better but not worse than many other hotels I have stayed at. 1 evening I sat at the Cocktail lounge and enjoyed the hospitality of the staff there and had quite a few laughs whilst enjoying the Happy Hour ( 3 hours ) of buy 1 get 1 free. Would I stay there again.?? It is worthy to consider another stay, but you learn from the experience that you have to be better prepared with your own supply of coffee. Value for money ? acceptable because of the special price on offer when I booked. Would have rated this hotel 100% except for the fact of the lack of coffee supplied in the room or at the buffet breakfast. Come on Laluna, it doesn't cost much to lift your game in this area. Hotel rating for me = 75%. If this has helped you decide on Laluna Hotel, please give me a tick of approval.", "title": "4 Star - 3 Star - 2 Star - 1 Star ....
