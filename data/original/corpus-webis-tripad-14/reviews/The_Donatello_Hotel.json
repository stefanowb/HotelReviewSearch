We drove up Saturday morning from Monterey, CA to see Spiderman 3 on the IMAX at the Metreon and to go to the nightclub Ruby Skye. We couln't have picked a better location. Period. Upon our arrival, the bellhop was curteous and very patient as I unloaded ALL the crap I had brought for my 1 night stay (you know how many shoes women like to bring!). Mark, the front desk man, was extremely nice. When I entered our hotel room, I was astonished at the size of the room! If you've visited San Francisco, then you are aware that most normal hotel rooms are pretty tiny. This room had to be around 400 sq. feet! It was very modernly designed and the comforter on the bed was one of the softest I have slept under. We hadn't been in our room more than 10 minutes when there was a knock at the door and the maid was there to give us our complimentary bath robes. The concierge also called to say she was sorry she had missed us when we checked in, and to come down for our free maps of San Francisco (which had an AWESOME map of all the shopping places).
