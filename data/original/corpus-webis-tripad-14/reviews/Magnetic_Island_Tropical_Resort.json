Really pleasant owner and a nice cabin. Pleasant pool was a bonus though we spent our time out on the beaches. It is a disance from the better beaches but a bus stop for the Island's free bus service is just outside the property which was great. Would recommend it. Also while thinking about Magnetic Island can't fail to mention the wonderful food at a restaurant at Horseshoe Bay - forget the name but it is the place furthest away from the bus stop and Geckos bar.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "AlYorks", "date": "January 21, 2006", "id": 4367757}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Lovely Chalet", "text": "We stayed here for two nights in October, but perhaps we did not see the hotel in its best light as there was a wedding one evening and a local football team had reached the final of a major competitoin so the hotel was closed the next night.
