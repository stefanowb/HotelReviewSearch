We arrived by car and did not get directions from the hotel staff, so we had a difficult time locating the hotel which was our fault. It is located on a main pedestrian walkway which we drove our car thru all the people. Scary.

First thing, location is awesome. It's halfway between the Duomo and Uffizi Gallery along the main pedestrian street. It allowed for coming and going, dropping off purchased items as the day went on. My room actually overlooked the street (which gives a great perspective) but made me worry their might be too much noise. That was not the case at all. The windows must be new because they completely blocked out all sound but also opened easily to get in fresh air. The staff was very friendly, spoke English very well, and had excellent suggestions of where to eat. There were two computers available to access the internet. Something I consider to be a luxury in europe. Breakfast was included but was very basic (bread, cereal, coffee, and yogurt.)
