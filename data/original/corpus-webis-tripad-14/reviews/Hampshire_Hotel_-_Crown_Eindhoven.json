Rooms are ok, although unlike other 3/4 star holidays, they do not supply you with face fannels, nor do they change the sheets during your stay. Housekeeping also seem to think it is not their duty to clean the coffee table - all the dirty glasses from the bar were still there when we got back.

Virtually no place to sit in lobby except for two or three uncomfortable chairs. The old bar was much better and the breakfast on the 2nd floor prior to remodeling was much better than now. Only advantage to this hotel (which has very small rooms) is close proximity to central Eindhoven and rail station.

Having to suffer the indignity of pushing the beds together was bad enough, but not helped by the cleaners insisting on putting them back to there original positions each day of our stay.

It was only on coming to pay the bill that the real upset came. We had been told categorically on arrival that breakfast was included in the room price and so dutifully had eaten in the hotel restaurant, even though we had friends with whom we would otherwise have dined. The bill however had the additional cost of breakfast added. This just added insult to injury after what had been barely an adequate stay in an average hotel. In spite of the hotel admitting that the mistake was theirs, they still refused to waive the additional charge and we were forced to pay due to the unfortunate position of having a flight to catch.
