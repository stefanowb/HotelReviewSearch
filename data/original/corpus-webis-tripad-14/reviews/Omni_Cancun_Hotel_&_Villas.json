Yes there are wonderful pools, jacuzzi bars, beaches, lagoon views, Da Vinci ... and I enjoyed them, but I found whether you were treated well depends on some other factors. I was assigned room 1821 before my arrival, and was greeted warmly by the receptionist until he checked my reservation, which showed a Priceline price and my room was then changed to the lowest level. I did not know this until I was led to the room, which was obviously assigned to someone else earlier in the day since the soap was used and a room card was left behind showing the check-in date. The room was incredibly musty and I need to turn on the air conditioner all the time even this means I could not sleep well. There was no view of anything except workers working on the lawns. I am not very demanding and I actually only spent the night there so I did not bother to change. My friend could not reach me because every time the operator connected him to a wrong room (my original assigned room I guess). One night a huge roach crawled into the room and I had to wait 20 min before they could find someone to deal with it. But the most terrible thing happened the check-out day. I packed my stuff and left the hotel for some shopping at 10am. When I returned at 11:30am to take my things out and check-out, a Mexican family of 3 or 4 were standing in front of my room with a valid room key - I did not know if they had gone into the room or not, but my room key was already invalid. A staff was then called and I was given their key to enter the room! I fled the place - I guess they don't welcome my stay and I will definately not stay there either.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "lizzylizzy", "date": "January 8, 2004", "id": 1543457}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "The Good, The Bad & The Ugly", "text": "Since I based my accommodation decision on these reviews (and price), I feel compelled to contribute. My family of four (50,49,19,17) spent Christmas at the Omni and really enjoyed ourselves. Like every vacation there were ups and downs but for the most part we had no serious complaints and a LOT of fun.For the record, we are experienced travellers, been to Ixtapa and Los Cabos but never Cancun.I will elaborate for those who want insight and details. We went all-inclusive, 7 days, around $1500 CDN with Conquest Travel.The flight on SkyService went fine, but the plane seats were brutally small, and we are not large people. A sandwich and crackers is the dinner, and drinks & headphones cost $2.50 & $5.00Arrival went smoothly, got stung at the airport by a time-share scam for 50% discount on excursions, but only cost me $10. The airport allows these sharks in there without clear identification of intentions but most people knew to avoid them (so much for the experienced travellers).Bus ride was the beginning of the \"we work for tips only\" routine, which would be a recurrent theme. The check-in was painless and the rooms (lagoon view) were acceptable. We were warned through TripAdvisor of the musty smells, so we prepared by bringing plug-in deodorizers and scented candles. The smell was primarily in the hallways, and was not offensive, just musty.The hotel is very pretty, spacious, and tastefully decorated. It is NOT a 5-star however, 4 at best. Mostly because it needs some refurbishing. Some paint, new faucets a little polish and it could be there - but again, nothing that would make you unhappy.The staff was great, on their terms. Everyone works on Mexican minutes, which have a wide variation from slow to never but we're on vacation so time is not something to stress about.The main restaurant La Paloma was great. Food was good but spice-less. It was rare to find a hot dish, both literally and figuratively. Shorts, swimsuits and t-shirts are the dress code, day and night. Try the Mexican coffee cinnamon flavoured and tasty. The custom made omelettes were delicious.Pina Colada s was a real treat. We loved eating on the beach, with our toes in the sand. Food was great, and hot, and tasty. Absolutely no complaints here at all.The Jacuzzi bar, which we were very excited about, turned out to be disappointing. A fabulous view and concept, the problem was it was almost cold, making it uncomfortable to truly enjoy for very long. It was worth doing though, for the uniqueness of it. There are also swings there, which the kids loved (I m talking big kids here).Da Vinci s was a Jekyl and Hyde scenario. The food was terrific and first class anyone who says otherwise must be eating in some unbelievable restaurants, because we are both gourmet cooks and we loved it. The attitude however, was well odd. The Maitre d is a jerk, didn t care for him at all. We made reservations with the concierge. Arrived on time dressed to the nines. He explained we did not have reservations and basically turned away. First off, the place was empty (it was 9:00 by the way), secondly he was downright rude. Turns out they put us down for the next night by accident so we left hungry. The next night we showed up, and to my shock he made a joke of not letting us in the night before!!!!!! Oh, I am sorry you are not on the list..hahahaha . He needs to look at the Maitre d manual again, the little snot.We learned quickly that Da Vinci s has their own rules as to who can eat there. While they claimed that every night was sold out, between others and us we learned that it was never past 50% full. In an all-inclusive that pushes this incentive, I think that is unacceptable behaviour.This is turning into a short novel, so I will try to wrap up quickly. Pool activities were fun, geared to young families but too loud for those of us not interested in games and music on inferior speakers. We spent everyday on the beach, which was why we went there.The lobby bar was very nice and we always ended up there at some point. Ditto for the spa and gym very well equipped and appointed.Two final notes one of the things that we were warned about were the time-share folks. We were never approached once. There were folks at two desks, which I assume were them, but it was a total non-issue.Finally, the Omni is a decent, above average Mexican resort. We most definitely feel we got our monies worth. It is a budget first class atmosphere. By the time we add up the excursions, shopping etc. the trip is around $10,000 Cdn for four adults. You want more, you pay more but I think that is the minimum the week will cost to do everything you want without eating crackers in your room. By the way, you MUST do the all-inclusive or it will cost you a LOT more than that.Did we have a wonderful vacation, YES. Did the Omni do their part, YES. Would we stay there again, NO for the reasons above, but we will return to Mexico, yet again, next year!

We went AI, which was great. The food was good. If you don't like the buffet you can order off the menu. Da Vinci's is a must! Yes, men have to wear long pants and no sandals - it is well worth it. And the sandwiches by the pool were always excellent. I was afraid we might feel a little tied to the resort doing the AI. Well, we never wanted to leave, it's that good to be there.

I gained 7 pounds! Oh, well. Also, there was a bit of a musty smell in the lobby, and very slightly in our room. We did take candles and that helped. Also, I would have liked to have heard more Mexican music being played in the lobby and by the pool.If you are looking for an active vacation with a lot of sightseeing and want to go into town for the restaurants, you might save money by going to another resort closer to the action.

When we left for cancun we had a 4 hour delay due to the fact that Champion Air did not have a back up pilot plan! We had to wait for a pilot to be flown in from Dallas, TX. We lost a whole day of our vacation because of this! We never got to Cancun until 3:30 and we were supposed to be there at 10:00am. The Omni was great, the food was excellent, the service was excellent! and most of all the accomodations were above the average! The other thing WOrry Free screwed up was we were supposed to have a Ocean Front room and we were given a Lagoon View with the sewage system right in front of our room! Thank Goodness we didn't spend much time in the room! The only bad thing about the Omni was there is not a selection at all of AMERICAN BEER! If you want to pay $9.00 for a six pack you can do that! at the nearest carry-out. The beaches were gorgeous, clean and the colors of the ocean were magnificent! When our trip came to an end the WOrry Free Agent told us to be in the lobby of the hotel at 9:30 to go to the airport. I specifically asked the agent if he had checked to see if there were any delays, he said no we are on schedule, but I think he never called the airport because when we got there, it was already posted on the board, 3 HOUR DELAY!! Another wasted day in an airport due to WORRY FREE TRAVELS! We could have stayed at the hotel and enjoyed the sun at least for this time!

Overall, the Omni Hotel was much nicer than I would have imagined. Check-in was relatively painless and quick. Were it not for a maintenance man who had to repair a hinge within the first hour, the whole process would have lasted under 1/2 hour. The bellboy, Jesus, was very helpful pointing out where everything was located in the hotel, how one books tours, and how one books a return transfer to the airport.I had an oceanview room without a balcony and it was quite spacious. The sattelite TV was a nice perk though the spanish-subtitles were often a distraction. I only wish I could have figured out when the Cancun weather was b/c trying to figure out the weather from the Miami stations (they have ABC, NBC, and CBS) wasn't always helpful. As for the room, the only drawbacks were the noise from the pool area which made siestas a little more difficult than I would have hoped and the tendency of the room to get humid really quickly if you turn down the A/C. The food at the Omni ranges from quite good to borderline acceptable. For the most part, I stuck to the buffets so as to sample a bit of everything. Dinners at La Palomba had a different theme each night. By far and away, Mexican and Italian nights are the best. I couldn't even sample all the great Italian foods. The Mexican dinner was served out by the pool area and was accompanied by a little show and arts and crafts for sale. The Cajun theme night was probably the least appealing partly b/c little of it was actually Cajun or anything that remotely would be served in New Orleans. Just a lot of blackened fish and standard dishes. As for breakfasts, you have two options. There is a buffet at LaPalomba which I took advantage of on those days I had an early tour as the restaurant opens at 6a.m. and tours usually pick up at 7:05. I'm not a big fan of American breakfasts, especially when I am trying (with little success at the end) to ward off 'turista' or stomach related illnesses. (Not to worry, in my case it was caused by ingesting too much water while snorkeling for the first time. The water at the Omni is purified). The pane dulce or sweetbreads were a real treat and I usually ate a few of them and some pancakes.As for the Pina Colada restaurant for breakfast, what better than a couple pancakes or toast, juices (including watermelon and canteloupe, a really interesting mix), and the sun over the Carribean. Service is a tad slow at the Pina Colada but you aren't there to rush, so I let it go in stride.While lounging on the beach, you can get mixed drinks, beer, and food from Pina Colada. The staff usually comes around about once an hour to check if you would like anything and it takes a little longer than I would have anticipated (about 10-15 minutes) for the order to be filled. The drinks are good. The margaritas a little strong, the daquiris not quite so strong. Be sure to get some bottled water, too, as it is quite hot and humid even on the beach (and especially humid at night). As for the beach, it's that sticky coral sand which seems not to want to go away even in the shower. The plus side is the sand is never too hot (even in 100 degree days). The beach isn't very wide (maybe 50 yards on average) like in Miami or the Outer Banks of North Carolina. But, it is wide enough to allow for beach walking and still be close enough to the water. Because of the tropical storms off the coast near Cuba and Central America, the surf was quite strong and I stayed out of the water most days. On occasion, the lifeguards would call people back closer to the shore.The pools are nice, you can even lounge in a recessed chase lounge in the water, get served a drink, and watch folks get temporary tatoos or paint ceramics on the lower pool. I'm not a big pool person, but given the rough surf, I found myself there a little more than I would have imagined.As for tours, the Omni has representatives from American Express and Olympus. I travelled with Olympus and while the agents at the Omni, especially Ricardo, are quite helpful even finding me tours to other locations like Isla Contoy and Coba, the tours themselves are hit and miss. It really depends on who the guides are. Chichen Itza was great and despite the heat and humidity, there is plenty of shady trees to hide under and admire the ruins. The food there stinks but there is live entertainment at the restaraunt (Mayaland Hotel). Tulum and Xel-Ha make for a great tour day though Tulum is quite hot b/c there is no shade whatsoever. If you are not into the Mayan culture, it might be best to skip Tulum especially if you are going to Coba or Chichen-Itza. Xel-Ha is amazing. Within minutes you are snorkeling with manta rays right below and tropical fish everywhere.Xcaret might be a nice place, but the tour guide was a total a** as it was raining all day. He tried to get us to cancel or reschedule with no guarantees we'd get our money back or could do it. He made us switch from a bus to a van in Puerto Morales b/c there were only 6 of us left out of 60 to start the day. Then he tried to talk us out of staying for the night show, which is why I booked the tour for Friday anyway. Btw, the night show is amazing and well worth the price of admission alone.My last tour was to Coba and Chemuc. You travel on some really back roads through Mayan villages to an underground cenote for swimming, kayak for about 15-30 minutes, rappell and zipline (what a blast), have an authentic Mayan lunch (don't worry the water is all brought in from Cancun and purified), and visit the ruins at Coba. As it started to rain heavily at Coba, I sprung a little for a Mayan taxi-bike and got to ruins just before the rains hit. The pyramids are much higher than anywhere in Mexico and the descent back down can be quite intimidating.I really enjoyed Cancun and the Omni. I wish there were more food options, especially some option for a little lighter fare when my stomach was a little queasy or I was sunburned. But I would strongly recommend it and would go back especially given the price I paid (less than $150 a night including non-stop airfare from the Midwest, oceanview, and all-inclusive). The staff are wonderful, especially the staff at the lobby bar, Franceso at Pina Colada, Jesus the porter, and Ricardo at Olympus Tours. I travelled alone and was never felt like I needed to rush to accomodate the families or those on the European plan. Checkout was painless, fast and no hidden charges. Yes, there are time-share sharks but they have to stay in a special room way off the beaten path with the exception of those peddling the Omni's premier membership. And even those guys aren't aggressive, you have to approach them and then, you have to bring the subject up. Whenever I asked them for directions, the cost of bus fare, whatever, they basically were polite, gave me an answer, and didn't press the time shares. On the whole, the Omni is a great place to stay and I would strongly recommend it, especially if you want an all-inclusive resort.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mike_arruda", "date": "September 3, 2003", "id": 1272752}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic Vacation", "text": "We stayed at the Omni April 30th-May 7th.
