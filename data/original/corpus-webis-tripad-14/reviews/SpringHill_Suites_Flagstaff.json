Regardless, we didn\u2019t think we could handle the room with the smell, so we called down to the front desk to switch rooms.

Most annoying, though, is the bathroom door. The sliding bathroom door is frosted glass. It isn\u2019t see-through, but does let significant light from the bathroom through.
