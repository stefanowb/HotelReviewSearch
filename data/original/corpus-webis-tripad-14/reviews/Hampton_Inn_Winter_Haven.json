Seating is @ premium as there aren't enough tables & chairs. She went & got folding chairs & a large folding table for some guests. I thought that was very nice of her. The eggs & whatever other hot food items, three in total didn't look appetizing @ all. But what do you want for free. We were on the 2nd floor near the elevator, & it was quiet. Rooms were ok, need updating, but clean. Never left enough towels, our connecting room had 2 adults, 2 kids & a baby & they were never left enough towels, although extra towels were requested on our reservation & the front desk. I personally told the maid & that day I wasn't given hand towels or any extra bath towels. My son's room only got 3 bath towels for 5 people. Never got a chocolate chip cookie the entire stay. They were always gone, had macadamia & oatmeal raisin. They were good but kids always wanted a chocolate chip cookie. Always had coffee available in the lobby. Nice feature.
