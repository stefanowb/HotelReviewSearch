As reviews have stated it is very close to Na'ama Bay which is a short walk away. We were given a bungalow near to the pool which was clean and tidy with everything that we needed. The only slight problem was that on a couple of nights there were beach partys etc with very loud music which could be heard until quite late this did not bother us too much but mentioned it so others who may be disturbed by it can ask for a room in the main hotel. The staff are all very friendly and Ahmeen our cleaner kept our room spotless also Bianca the guest relations manager is very helpful and nothing is too much trouble for her. We ate at all the restaurants connected to the hotel and the food was really nice in all of them. Make sure you pay a visit to the spa as they are very good I had a manicure, pedicure and facial but remember to haggle the price!

Even though the hotel is a little outdated, the service we recieved was impeccable at times. All the staff are really friendly and couldn't be more happier to help, specially Islam (Redsea Holidays rep). The hotel was clean and provided great amenities and is fantastically located. The staff at the private beach (Hysham) was extremely attentive and made our holiday a enjoyable and relaxing experience. I agree with what others have to say about the sunbeds on the beach which requires more attention but no harm done. Secondly with regards to location, it is approx 5 mins walk to the hustle bustle promenade. This place is crazy, you need to ensure you are prepared for this. However the most polite way to say you are not interested is to use the word (SHUK-RAN) which means thank you in Arabic. We did Quad biking for 3 hours are paid a tenner, speed boating which was booked whilst we were on the beach and paid \u00a345 each which entails snorkelling on 2 different islands and finally ended our holiday with a visit to the Soho Square (Ice Bar) This is a must do which was booked with Red Sea Holidays from the hotel itself which entails a free entry to the ice bar, a game of bowling and Culturama (Egyptian History)", "title": "Celebrated Anniversary & 30th Birthday 2in1", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Carlito B", "date": "May 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 160687898}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013", "text": "We will definitely be using Ghazala beach again !!!!", "title": "You get you pay for!! :)", "user": "smallya24", "date": "May 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 160574850}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Myself and my partner arrived back from ghazala beach hotel last night. The hotel is exactly what it states to be (booked through red sea holidays.) Its clean but basic. Could do with some updates but I can't complain when only paying \u00a325O pp for bed and breakfast and flights. There a two pools both of good sizes and we always found a sunbed even later on in the day, we found more people on the beach, the beach is lovely and sandy unlike other beaches you may find in sharm. The food in the ghazala beach bar is average, the hotel kebab hut is good for a quick tea, I ate 3 times during our 3 night stay at kokai - getting take out twice as I really didn't enjoy walking around naama bay as there is way to much hassle. If you ignore the egyptian people they basically insult you or grab your hand and try to drag you along. Also the men on camels will walk there camel into you if you don't take a picture which will cost you. Really cannot moan about the hotel at all, only problem is on the 1st floor there are cupboards which we often found open - when looking in the cupboard we found a 2Oft drop and pipes/drains - I'd say dangerous for children or if you've had a one to many. Staff are friendly, but can be a bit to cheeky demanding tips. I gave the porter 3 english pounds as I hadn't changed my money - I got a frown!!! And I heard 'can I keep the change' way to often!!! I certainly recommend the hotel massage!! Don't be fooled by the prices we got 6 hours worth of massage through the week for \u00a315O when it should of been triple!! If you can handle feeling imtimidated all week, followed about, constantly being beeped at and the awful looking dumpsites around you then this is a bargain for you :) :) I recommend spider cafe!
