We booked through BA and got a pretty good deal. We found the hotel to be excellent in most ways; Clean, comfortable, warm and modernized rooms. Efficient, helpful and friendly staffs at the front desk and for the cleaning . Within 5 minute walk to the South Kensington Tube station and the wonderful and some reasonable restaurants near there. Our stay came with a continental breakfast - which was upgraded to full English for free, although we didn't realize it was free until checkout. The food was uninspired, but since eating out in London is exorbitant, any meal for free was more than welcome. Our only complaint was with the restaurant staff, they were uniformly unhelpful and slow.

It is convenient to two Tube stations \u2013 South Kensington and Knightsbridge. I only used the South Kensington station. For those arriving from Heathrow, the Piccadily line travels from Heathrow to the South Kensington station. Unfortunately, to exit the station, one must go up a flight of stairs to get to street level. There are very few Tube stations which are truly accessible, so as with the rest of Europe, it\u2019s probably a good idea to pack light. The exits from the South Kensington station are a bit confusing as the streets around the station are not in a grid pattern. To get to the Underground exit closest to the hotel, go past the turnstiles and then head to the sign \u201cSubway to Museums\u201d. This subway (underpass) has limited hours \u2013 roughly open when the museums are open. The first exit from the subway is \u201cBrompton Rd.\u201d and this is the exit that is just a few steps away from the hotel.

There was only one bar of soap for the bathroom. There was one face cloth, two fluffy bath towels and two hand towels. There was a nice towel warmer which was activated by turning on the taps that resultedin hot water running through the rack. The countertops and flooring were made of granite. The tub was a Jacuzzi tub with strong jets. Inside the room, the television was the standard small European size. It had very limited channels and about four pay-per-view channels. It did have guest services features (such as checking ones bill) but the checkout feature was not working when I tried it. The television also had a convenient digital clock, and served also as an alarm. In the closet was an electronic safe, small ironing board, and iron. The desk, which had a small mirror, had the hairdryer (with excellent power) in the top drawer. Underneath the television were a mini-fridge (empty, with instructions to call the front desk to have it stocked if required) and an electric tea kettle with teabags and instant coffee.
