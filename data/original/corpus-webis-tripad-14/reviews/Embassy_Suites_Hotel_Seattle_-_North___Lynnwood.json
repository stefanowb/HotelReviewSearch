We go with another family each year and the suites are spacious and comfortable for us. The breakfast in the morning is wonderful including an omelette bar and a nice selection of hot and cold breakfast as well. Everything was great however the only downside to this hotel and we had this problem last year was the busyness of the hotel and the pool area was chaotic. Kids are everywhere and scream quite loudly and echos in the pool area. The pool is quite cool so not really enjoyable and the hot tub is always jammed with people.

The pool was relaxing with the waterfall cascading down into the water. The complimentary breakfast was amazing. The amount of items to add to your omelette was quite vast; about 10 different things.

The pool area is extremely noisy. Don't expect to relax in the hot tub. It was always packed and heavily chlorinated, so much so we left early to keep our eyes from watering. Their heavy chlorine made my legs itch very badly. The breakfast is the highlight of the stay with sounds of waterfalls around you. Everything was delicious, pancakes, french toast, and bacon were barely warm though. They have a very good oatmeal with all the fixings. The elevators smelled pretty bad, like stinky feet. I don't know about the past complaints about the pillows, but ours were fabulous, fluffy feather pillows. Bed was very comfortable, just very tight in our room. Not much distance between the bed and the tv. We left our hotel everyday in the morningand didn't come back til the evening, so we would stay here again. difficult acces from the south bound I-5.
