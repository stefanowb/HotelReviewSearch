The flat panel tv great. the room is huge. you could live there. the bathroom exceptional and the smells lovely. The \"rain\" shower is unbelievable. We are very picky. We could not find one thing wrong with this place. It was truly amazing. when we got back to Bangkok, we bought jasmine oil and an oil burner to remember the smell. and we bought the cd that they played for us everynight from the loft. it was really a great experience. we highly recommend this place for couples who really want to get away from the stress. bring your work... free wireless is in the room. but also relax.", "title": "Perfect Destination.
