By the way, this train station is probably the ugliest building in Florence. The public areas and the rooms in the hotel are very clean. The room was not large but big enough to be comfortable. There are no views of the city centre from the hotel so you want to get out and walk around to see the sites. The staff was polite but did not seem knowledgeable about the local attractions, restos or shopping. In general, this hotel reminded me of a regular 3-star North American chain hotel.

The staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming and they put us in an \"upgrade\" room that was quite a lovely surprise. We were placed in a room (I believe it was 002 or 003) that had a double sized jaccuzi, double shower, a second bedroom \"balcony\". It was definitely within our top 2 hotels of our stay out of the 6-7 we stayed in! Now, was it perfect? No, we couldn't figure out how to run the jets for the jacuzzi but we enjoyed the soak after the 7-8days of walking Italy previous, and one of the shower heads didn't flow properly, however we didn't care. Our only regret was that we were only able to stay one night because of our schedule. We are sure that the staff would have shown us how to use the jets and fixed the second shower head had we stayed more than one night. They showed us to a fabulous dinner (in fact our favorite of our ENTIRE trip, at \"18 Gobbi\", a MUST visit, favorite wine of the trip, staff very charming, the house special Rigatoni a MUST!) The hotel was quiet, the breakfast lovely, and it was within walking distance to everything! Fabulous all around! I'm sorry to hear others had an \"adequate\" experience.
