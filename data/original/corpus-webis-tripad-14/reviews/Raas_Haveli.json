We weren't particularly impressed with the breakfast (not a huge amount of choice) but the food at dinner and lunch was good. Happy to be centrally located so we could visit the surrounding streets and a short climb to the fort. I would advise to visit the fort without a personal guide and take the audio guides available on request and then take a guide to visit the streets of old town Jodhpur. We enjoyed our tour of the old city with our guide Ram however we did feel pressured into buying things (from the textile warehouse, from the perfume shop, from the spices shop). A common feeling I think for most tourists in India! We wished we had been more insistent on what we wanted to do at the beginning of our walk. Unfortunately our stay at the Raas came at the end of our trip to India so we were well used to this tactic and were therefore not enthusiastic on shopping. We also had to pay 100rps for a short rickshaw ride which seemed overpriced.", "title": "A perfect home base for a Jodhpur visit", "user": "artichokeannie", "date": "February 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153288319}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Terrific hotel", "text": "Nevertheless I would still recommend a guide to go around the streets as you will see another side of life in the city.

Our room on the second floor was perfect, with the view of the garden and the fort above. I actually loved hearing the calls to prayer (but not so much the music playing in the garden at that early hour). I began my stay with a fine massage, with an unexpected touch I'll remember forever: when I lay face down, I was looking at a bowl of rose petals! The food was so delicious we had dinners at the hotel both nights, and my husband is still talking about his favorite-pizza-ever. We ate on the terrace for the views, and appreciated the nice hot coals that made it possible. We were very grateful for our wonderful servers and their guidance to dishes that would not be too spicy for us. Breakfast choices were beautifully presented and delicious, too.

The site was formerly the home of the aristocratic Thakur family, and the original 18th-century haveli has been carefully renovated to produce the four old buildings of the hotel. The three new buildings are modern and contemporary in their use of space and light, and yet are grounded in tradition. Jodhpur's red sandstone unites the new with the old, with modern designs in its latticing and carving adding a fresh dimension to the region's age-old stone carving industry. This seamless harmony between the old and the new, the modern and the traditional, extends to all aspects of RAAS. Almost all of the rooms have magnificent views of Mehrangarh Fort from both the private terraces and from the cast iron bathtubs, and those that don\u2019t have their own private gardens and views over the old haveli and landscaped gardens of RAAS. The rooms are furnished with state of the art amenities: all rooms are air-conditioned with the latest eco friendly machines, and have overhead fans, hairdryers, safes, central heating, wi-fi, TV, telephones and en suite bathrooms. There are rooms with easy access for the handicapped and non-smoking rooms. RAAS boasts two fine dining restaurants, which offer both Indian and International cuisine: Darikhana is a beautiful terraced restaurant and the Baradari Caf\u00e9 is inside the old pavilion and offers a relaxing location near the pool. There is also a luxury spa that offers a full range of treatments and a boutique shop. RAAS is the ideal place to soak up the rich local heritage of Jodhpur while at the same time indulging in opulent luxury and comfort. As soon as you drive through the old wooden gates in RAAS\u2019s very own blue tuk-tuk, the majesty of Mehrangarh Fort will be tempered by your sense of relaxation."}
