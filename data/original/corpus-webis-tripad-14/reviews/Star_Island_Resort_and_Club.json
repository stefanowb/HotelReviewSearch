I was not impressed with the mini suite. We could hear every thing from next door, mold on the ceiling,tastless decor. sheets with holes, towels with holes,two very cramped rooms with very small tv sets, A/C unit very loud. I could not relax or sleep in this place. the rooms where not well lit. I felt itchy when I entered the room. The main grounds very well kept. pool was very nice. They charge .75 for local calls. The mini suite does not sleep 6 the sofa bed had no cushion what so ever you can see the coils. my daughter had to sleep on it unopened. I have seen better rooms in three star hotels/motels than this. I don't know why anyone would by a timeshare with this type of room.

I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews, but I can honestly say that this Hotel was really quite nice. Our check-in was no problem and we were able to get into our room right away (it was about 2:30 in the afternoon). We had suites A and B and there was ample room. The master bedroom was beautiful and we took advantage of our private jacuzzi...felt great after those long park days! The kitchen was fully equipped with everything that you would need. The washer and dryer came in handy as well. Although the decor is abit outdated, the room was very very clean. Loved the artistic way they would display the towels. Nice touch!! There was the odd bug but hey, it was pretty hot and humid so the odd insect is expected. Nothing to worry about! The grounds around the Hotel were equally clean. The gym was great. The pool was wonderful and there were alot of activities to take part in. The kids loved it!!! The staff at the spa were very gracious as well....had the best pedicure..thanks Lorena!! And it is nice and close to Walt Disney World....All and all we had a lovely stay at the Star Island Resort and I would recommend it to anyone!!!!

The team stayed in a combination of two 3-bedroom suites/condos (which sleeps 10 comfortably) and four 2-bedroom suites. We had a total (inc. players) of 35 people staying at Star Island resort and everyone thought it was a marvelous place. It is super clean and has a terrific staff that accomodated us when we requested more towels, blankets and sheets. They let us check in 3 hours early and let us checkout an hour late. They have daily activities which we couldnt participate in b/c of our baseball itinerary but would have if we had the chance. They offer dinner specials from area restaurants which are very good and affordable - not to mention convenient. The suites are beautiful and are huge. At times, we had most of the team in our unit for meetings and there was plenty of room. There's also a private balcony outside the units w/ a table and chairs. I really can't say enough good things about this resort. Our experience truly could not have been better. As far as it being a 5 star resort - I would give it 10 stars!!! We are definitely going back there next year b/c I think if we'd go anywhere else we'd be disappointed.

TV in every room, with CD player and speakers the whirlpool jet bath is a great way to relax after the all day walking at the near by parks. And talk about things to do, there is Disney 10 min. from your front door. 20 min. away is one the top 10 BASS fishing lakes in the U.S. And there is plenty of shopping, everything from Flea markets to fine stores less than 30 min away.

Tacky decor, smelly rooms, no non-smoking rooms, windows that had to be kept open with a pot, old sheets, have to pay for housecleaning, not enough towels, loud bar (worse because we had to have the windows open - karaoke night), blowing leaves and cutting grass at 5 a.m., have to pay .75 cents everytime you pick up the phone, service was awful. No washer/dryer in room but on main floor of building (very old, tore my clothes). I would not recommend this resort to my worst enemy. We did the timeshare tour (very tacky) and we were paid $50 or discount at an event (I read on someone else's review they were paid $75!) We were told it would only take one hour and it took two!
