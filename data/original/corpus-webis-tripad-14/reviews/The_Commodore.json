We stayed at the Commodore Condominiums on the east end Thomas Drive. I would stay here again. When looking for a condo I look for cleanliness and comfort above all. I have a few basics that one has to meet: Clean, Good Bedding, Washer/Dryer in unit, Dishwasher. Every thing else is just extras. After all we're just renting. A co-worker had recommended this complex. We've stayed in several condos on the gulf coast over the past several years and this 2b/2ba condo #603 was probably the cleanest condo we've ever stayed in. It doesn't appear to be the newest complex but it is well maintained. The bedrooms were roomy. The master had a king bed, private full bath, and large walk-in closet also walk out to the balcony. The 2nd bedroom had a full and queen size beds and large walk-in closet. There was also a pull-out sofa bed in the living room. All more than enough room for the three of us. The kitchen had every thing you might need to cook in. Dining area had a large table w/ 6 chairs and also a bar w/ 2 stools. The living room had the sofa, love seat and an odd chair. The view from the living room out onto the balcony was a beautiful unobstructed view of the gulf. The pool area was pretty and had a kiddie pool and hot tub. They also have on sight security. The security guards are super friendly and do not cause any inconvenience to Commodore's guest.

We rented a 2 bedroom condo for $135/night. Go to their website and look at the specials. I rented 6 nights and got the 7th night FREE. The room was very spacious and stocked with everything we needed. Full kitchen, washer & dryer, dish washer, a huge balcony and a great dining room and living room. The decor was beach themed but mature and well put together. We stayed on the 5th floor and we had a great view of the beach and all the amazing sunsets. The staff was very friendly, even the service guys were nice on the elevator! The pool was great. It was large and heated. Also there is a kiddie pool and a poolside hot tub :) Beach access is perfect with chairs for renters and the beach there was very clean and not crowed. The water was shallow for several hundred yards and St. Andrews Bay Park was within walking distance.

No snotty attitude here. We made our way to our room, 1207. A simply decorated 2 bedroom condo. Very nice furnishings. Flat screen TVs in Living and bedrooms. The carpets has been cleaned recently. The pool area was uncrowded as was the beach. All pools and spa were well chlorinated and clean. The facility was in the process of doing some work on the different floors there (Painting and floor refinishing), But there was no problem or noise from that. The elevators were clean and actually interrupted a staff member mopping them out. You have to remember that these are outside access elevators and have people with sandy feet in and out of them all day, so a little sand now and then is expected. We spoke with a few of the people that lived there and had nothing bad said about the renters. Apparently some one had some bad info as they were in the process of doing some outside restoration work. The Kitchen was well stocked with the necessary utensils and had no problem there. The one thing I can say about the overcrowding issue is to go \"off season!\" No traffic no crowds. I just failed to find any of the problems in the past two reviews that they did.

The Hot Tub was nice and the kiddie pool is average. I do think the main pool is a bit small for the number of units the Commodore has. Everytime we went there is was packed and we did not enjoy ourselves at the pool at all. It didn' help that there was a family reunion of very rude people there either. Anyway the beach area is very nice and well kept and the location is great and super close to several awesome restaraunts (Cptn. Andersons, Boatyard, Montego Bay, and Treasure Ship).
