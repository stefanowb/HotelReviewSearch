I had traveled to Richmond for a business trip. After long days in meetings,it was so refreshing to return to the B&B and find peace and quiet. The innkeeper, Jill, cooked a delightful full breakfast each morning and always left me sweet goodies in the evening! YUM! Her personality was charming which made my stay that much more enjoyable. I felt like I could kick off my shoes and wander the house admiring all the fine art and furnishings. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS EXPERIENCE!Next time I will take my husband with me!
