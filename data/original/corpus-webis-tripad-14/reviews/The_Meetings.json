It has taken me so long to write this review because I really did not want to upset the owners who were really very nice, but I did not particularly enjoy my stay. The rooms were very dusty, with dust visible along the skirting boards, on the lampshades and even on the lightbulb. Because I had a dust allergy - and it was summer, it just made life unbearable. The bathroom was also not too clean, with bacteria visible around the wash hand basin, in the shower tray and on the wall next to the wash hand basin. The room we had was particularly noisy - not from the pub below - but from the noisy people in the rooms next to us. One one side was someone who watched TV very loudly into the very early hours of the morning, and on the other side was a family with a young child who would bang doors and the drawers in the chest of drawers at the crack of dawn every morning, so if you are looking for a quiet peaceful stay in the irish countryside - this is not the place to come. Breakfast was good. Huge servings with unlimited tea and toast with a nice view of the river and a chance to spot lots of birds visiting the balcony feeding from the birdfeeders the owners has placed there. The tables and chairs were a little dated and needed a bit of modernisation, as did the whole breakfast room. But breakfast staff were very helpful and friendly. The pub downstairs does do a good pint, but the bar meals are absolutely awful - everything deep fried and a flashback to 70's cuisine. I found good restaurants hard to find in this area, so it;s good to have a nominated driver and to venture a bit further for a good bar meal. If every other B&B is full, then stay here for the good breakfast, but if you have the chance of another B&B if you are staying in this area I'd choose the other, at least until the rooms are given a good dust, the bathrooms are cleaned and the rooms are soundproofed (or people disrespectful of others who have things on too loud or don't tell their children to try not to make so much noice don't stay in them).", "title": "We won't meet again!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "andare", "date": "January 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 23894450, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good Breakfasts.", "disliked": "\u2014 Noise, dust, not a great location to find food in the evening."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed at The Meetings last year for a couple of nights and liked it so much we went back this year again!", "title": "Rooms Immaculate, Breakfast Superbe, Location Wonderful", "user": "cabbagesoup", "date": "August 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 18652910, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 beautiful setting, clean, convenient for drink and meal without having to travel", "disliked": "\u2014 really cannot think of anything that was so bad that I have to comment on it!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "It is located in such a beautiful area of Ireland.

The food is excellent and plenty of it!
