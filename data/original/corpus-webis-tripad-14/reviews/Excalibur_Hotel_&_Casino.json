When I went to the front desk, in tears, for help, they said the concierge would print them... would have been nice to know.

We immediately went to security to identify my purse only to find that $1100 in cash had been taken. The hotel maintains that our door was opened at 1:20 with one of the keys issued to us and closed at 5:54. Both times are incorrect. According to them our door was not secure. We had a cot in our room which would make access to the dresser difficult in the dark unless the room had been cased earlier. In addition we were advised by Security that there should be a sticker on the door with instructions for the use of the deadbolt. There was no sticker or instructions. There are no cameras in the hall and if the halls are patrolled by Security they are not looking for unsecure doors. We were in Tower 2 and no keys are checked by Security before you use the elevators and in addition it would be very easy for the intruder to use the elevator and exit by the door going to the pool. I have searched the internet and found that there are other cases of thefts while guests are sleeping. Losing money is one thing, but when you think that someone has entered your room it is very alarming. I will not let this matter rest. I will be staying at another hotel in future and be checking their security.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Beth8449", "date": "July 14, 2013", "id": 167572786}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Reserved a $20 room special which with taxes, fees, etc became $50.

Took the walkway across to New York, New York and had a Hard Cider and a Guinness at the Irish Pub with live music.

Head back to the lobby, waited in line for 15 minutes, got to the reservation counter, clerk just scolded at us, replaced the cards, never said sorry or anything. Next morning we went down to get some breakfast, went back to the room, tried calling the front desk to get a bellman to assist with the bags, spent 25 minutes on hold listening to commercials. Gave up, went back downstairs to the bell service counter, they said they would send someone up right away and they did.", "title": "Reasonable room, poor front desk, $20 room turns into $50 room", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sunnymikkel", "date": "July 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 167549753}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Except for the Bell Staff, customer service at the Excalibur is non existent.", "title": "Compared to the Imperial Palace , this place was the \"Ritz\"", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Vicki L", "date": "July 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 167515616}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My Favorite Aunt and I recently stayed @the Excalibur for 5 days 4 nights. We stayed in tower 2 , 11th floor, a non- smoking room. The room was comfortable , clean , and decorated nicely with comfy beds and great maid service. The bathroom was roomy and updated with new fixtures and well lit. The water pressure for the shower was weak , but doable . It was easy to see that The Excalibur was a older casino , and not in the center of the strip. No coffee pot in the room and a cup of coffee is about three bucks in the lobby . Get around that by bringing your own pot ( I brought one that boils water , and used instant coffee, a big money saver ) . No wifi or mini fridge , but no big deal either. The casino floor needed some updating , but there was plenty of security staff around and helpful hotel employees.On the second floor of the casino are plenty of places to eat , including a Crispy Kreme , Cinnabon , McDonald's, Popeye's Chicken, Asian , Italian and a all you can eat buffet , that serves breakfast and dinner , plus a steakhouse , which was very good. There was also a Dairy Queen and a yogurt land. Those that have complained about the smoke smell ...... your in a casino , you can't get away from that or those resort fees. I would definitely stay there again AND would recommend it to others.
