In 1994 I was married there and in 1997 I returned for our 3rd wedding anniversary. In those days the hotel was owned by Rob Barrat and it was quite simply a wonderful place to stay. Fabulous beach location, well run and well maintained hotel with a classy atmosphere. Since this time the hotel has undergone numerous changes of ownership. I returned there in November 2003 to discover that this once wonderful hotel has transformed itself into a cheap and tacky \"Holiday Camp\" style vacation property. The rooms are damp and shabby. The restaurant food is awful and many of the buildings are falling apart from a lack of maintenance and repair. All day and all night guests are subjected to the constant boom boom of the PA system and loud, loud music. The staff have abandoned all hope and are so dejected that they have no interest in guest welfare. This is no place for a relaxing holiday. After a week of this nonsense we moved to St. James's Club, a hotel the exudes all of the qualities that Pineapple used to have. Do not believe any of the so-called positive reviews of this hotel. It used to be fabulous, now it's quite simply awful. Pay a bit more and stay at St. James's (many of the former Pineapple staff work there, what a surprise!).", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "marshall", "date": "November 25, 2004", "id": 2846469}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good value", "text": "Well, we are back and not a bit happy about it!!

We found the Antigua resort to be similar to that one in the set-up, food, etc. We both thought this resort showed signs of proper care - fresh paint, etc. Our room was fantastic (832) - the view was the best!! The hike up the hill to our room was never an issue (ok...maybe after a few drinks it was a little more taxing ...but...that was our fault!!) The common areas were fine - my only complaint was with the guests leaving glasses, etc all over the place. I will never understand why people cannot walk to a trash can 10 feet away but thats my personal pet peeve. The entertainment was fine...we enjoyed the 3 or 4 of the nightly shows. The night with the group (I cannot remember their name - had a male singer and two females) was great entertainment - best live band we had seen in a while (by that I mean bands that you would see in a night club). All of the staff we encountered were very friendly. The only staff that didn't seem quite so outgoing was the bar staff but that could have been because we never 'sat' at the bar and made conversation with them - so no blame on them! Ms. Mary (the Outhouse) are keepers!! What a great place and one you would not normally come across at an all-inclusive so a very nice change! We left the New Hampshire license plate swaying in the breeze! Overall, the food was fine. Our only complaint was that it would have been great to have snacks like popcorn, pretzels, etc available. Breakfast is always my favorite while on vacation because I never seem to have time when at home so I loved that! We never got into the Pineapple Grill but did enjoy Chef Pietros one night. The vendors on the beach were never a problem. At checkout we did experience a charge to our room for the internet that neither of us did. It was a charge for the morning we were leaving - was only $5 and they did remove it when they confirmed the signature was not ours.
