I would never stay in this hotel again or recommend it to a friend. It was billed as a charming B and B type of hotel, which really means it is old and run down. The carpets were threadbare, the furniture was dusty and worn out, we had to put a towel on the upholstered chair in our room--it was that stained! The floors creaked and the windows leaked cold air, it was a terrible experience! The TV in our room was placed to the side ot the bed, so that you had to sit sideways on the bed to watch it, you could not even lay in bed and watch TV! There wasn't enough room in the very small bathroom to set your toiletries. I was very disapointed. I could hear everything in the surrounding rooms. The neighborhood is awful, I felt unsafe walking to my car. There were many beggers asking for money. There were not any bellhops to handle the luggage. So, trying to drag my suitcases across the old streets while fending off panhandlers--not fun!", "title": "Don't stay here!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "veda p", "date": "November 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 6138287, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing!", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything, there was nothing good about this hotel."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled on business", "text": "We were there for business and will stay next to the convention center next time we are in Baltimore.

The hotel was nice and I really liked the area-cobblestone streets, pubs, eateries, stores, etc. And the water taxi is right there, even though it was closed all weekend due to the weather.
