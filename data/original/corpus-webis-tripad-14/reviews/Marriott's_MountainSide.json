I took the wife and 2 kids, ages 7 and 10 to this oasis on the mountainside. I will start out with the bad(or more appropriately inconvenient). We arrived in Park City on 1/13/07, but our stay did not commence until the 14th. We shared a friends condo for the night of the 13th. We skied all day on the 14th and at 4:30 PM we went to check in, and we were told our room was not ready, and they were not sure when it would be ready. They took our phone number and said that they would call when our room was ready. We returned to our friends condo and waited for the call that the room was ready and the call never came. We returned to the hotel at around 7:30PM and checked in without a hassle. No phone call, but oh well.. With all that being said, do not count on getting in to your room at 4. Make plans to go to dinner and come back later in the evening OR check in with the front desk early in the day to plead your case.", "title": "Great Time at Mountainside Villas in Park City", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "jamlewis", "date": "January 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6622648, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The convenient location and spacious accomodations", "disliked": "\u2014 Not being able to check in on time"}}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 19, "very good": 74, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 116}, "aka": "Marriott`s Mountainside Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.229508196721}
