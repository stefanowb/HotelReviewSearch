On the day we were supposed to check in we called Nine Zero at 5AM to cancel and thought we had to beg that they wouldn't charge us the one night fee. We in no way had to beg for anything. The phone was answered in the wee hours by a most pleasant man (Brian) who was very cordial and understood we didn't want to get stuck in Boston in over a foot of snow with Blizzard conditions. He said of course there would be no charge to us. The reason I am writing this review is to let all know what wonderful folks work here and how well you are treated.

The room was beautiful, with large windows and a gorgeous view of Boston from the bed. The bathrooms were very roomy and nice as well. I am very surprised about the complaints here about the service. Service was over the top excellent during our stay, and we asked for a lot of different things. I thought they were great and seemed accustomed to providing high level service. We ate at their Spire restaurant for brunch with our families the morning afterwards, and it was great. The only hassle at all was that they accidentally billed us twice for the room and on wrong credit cards (we used different ones to reserve), but it was quickly fixed with a phone call.

Back to Nine Zero...a week before we left for Boston we received an e-mail from the manager offering assistance during our trip. They reserved tour tickets for us and couldn't have been nicer, like our own personal consierge. When we checked in, the front desk staff were so friendly and helpful, I couldn't believe it. We were early so they got us into one room and then rushed to get the other romm cleaned. They brought up our bags shortly and then ushered us to our room -- both were amazing for standard rooms but ours was a corner room overlooking the park. We loved the hotel so much we didn't even want to go on our tour, which was great too. We did the Duck Tour.

Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful--particularly at the concierge desk. The stay was not without a couple of problems, however. The modern design of the bathroom--and the glass shower in particular--was a problem, in that the shower door leaked water on to the floor and had to be fixed. Also, several channels on the Direct TV feed froze, and required a call to get them working. Finally, the hotel's highly praised restaurant just recently closed--it changed names and format (the previous chef left to open his own reataurant), and the new menu and prices did not look good enough to attract us for dinner. The one breakfast we had there was good, but overpriced. All in all, we really like Kimpton Hotels--the style, the amenities and the people.
