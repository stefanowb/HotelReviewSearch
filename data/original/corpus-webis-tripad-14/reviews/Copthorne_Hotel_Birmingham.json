We booked the rooms through Hotwire and it only cost \u00a389 for two doubles and you get what you pay for. One of the rooms was facing the Queensway which is a busy and noisy road and as it was a hot night we overheated as it was impossible to leave the window open due to traffic noise. Air conditioning was lacking big time. The TV in the room was of the old CRT variety with basic free view channels. Avoid the bar.
