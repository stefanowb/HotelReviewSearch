The only odd thing about the room is the bathroom which is kind of like a capsule embedded in the room. I was afraid the toilet may fall out of the wall! But I can't fault it in any other way. Accommodation is VERY expensive in London so the IBIS provided everything I needed at a good price, good location (very close to the train station), wifi in the room, tv, comfy bed, phone, clean & modern. If you just need a nice place to stay without all the frills (like gym & pool etc) then this is excellent. It's London, so who is going to be hanging out in their room anyway?!!", "user": "ellebee1233", "date": "March 24, 2013", "id": 155551098}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "We were given an extremely warm welcome by Mylene (I hope I have spelt this right), she was very friendly and informative. The room was ideal with everything you need for a weekend , tea,coffee facilities ,hair drier ,TV etc. this hotel is great for The O2 and shopping and easy access to London via the Tube. The breakfast is good value but my only criticism would be there can be limited seating if busy, it would also be a good idea to have a place for guests to put trays of used crockery as the staff were extremely busy and not always able to clear the tables. This is not their fault as they are very busy greeting guests, taking payment and general running of the buffet. We were greeted on Sunday by Cynthia who was again very friendly. All the staff we met were a credit to the hotel and could not have been friendlier or more helpful.", "user": "KCHUT", "date": "March 24, 2013", "id": 155519965}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent", "text": "Basic but very clean and great value.

It has nothing similar with London hotels in that price range and even double higher. The hotel is new, clean and I finally a double rooms are allocated to single person.

This Ibis fits the bill perfectly as it is 300 yards one way to Shepherds Bush tube station and the same the other way to the O2 (as well as being close to two other tube stations). The hotel has obviously not been open long and therefore feels fresh. It is a no frills establishment - but it is an Ibis so you don't expect anything else. The bed was perfectly comfortable and the \"pod\" bathroom was all that was needed. At \u00a38.95 (or thereabouts) for breakfast it was perfectly adequate for the price. If you wanted a hotel close to Westfield it would be perfect for that too.

My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights last week. When we arrived there was one man on the desk checking in another traveller but he saw to us quickly and efficiently and he was very cheery! The hotel interior is very contemporary but comfy, you can tell it is new! Our room was a nice size with lots of storage space. There was a Freeview TV and tea & coffee facilities as well as a hair dryer, for those interested. The bathroom was bright but was more of a wet room than a bathroom, but this wasn't an issue for us. The shower was hot and powerful and the shower gel smelt lovely :) the bed was very comfortable with the option for extra pillows. Another bonus was free wifi and reasonably priced room service! We had booked to go on the London Eye but had misplaced our printout - luckily there were fast computers downstairs which you could use at your whim with a free printer facility! Perfect.
