Due to the stregth of our AUD$ and the booking of a standard double room (excellent), I would drop the word 'very' and add the description 'outstanding value'. Florence offers a feast of cultural experiences for the traveller and as a consequence is busy and bustling just about all of the time. The hotel is only metres from the Ponte Vecchio but provides an oasis of calm and (relative) quiet both day and night. The bar serves great wines, an outstanding range of cocktails, and is the place to be and be seen. The laid-back music (the choice of a local DJ) is outstanding, perfectly matching the mood of the bar itself. The restaurant served some of the better creative food I have eaten and, despite our best efforts, I would not describe it as 'very expensive'.

The bathroom in this particular room was rather cramped, and it was difficult to get in and out of the tub/shower; but my friends' rooms and bathrooms were a bit more spacious. The staff was courteous and attentive. The hotel cocktail lounge was wonderful - both the inside and \"outside\" glassed-in spaces were lovely; great drinks and complimentary bite-sized hors d'oeuvres.
