Being in the suite end was quieter. The newer tower by the restaurant filled up with coachloads of guests - sometimes noisy school trips. Hubby fell ill on our 2nd day and the reception staff found us medical help, gave lots of good advice and kept an eye on him for the rest of the trip. Housekeeping were diligent and high standard, the mini bar was well stocked and reflected local shop prices. Tried the restaurant first morning/afternoon for buffet lunch - very dull and not great value - never tried breakfast or the hotel coffee shop.
