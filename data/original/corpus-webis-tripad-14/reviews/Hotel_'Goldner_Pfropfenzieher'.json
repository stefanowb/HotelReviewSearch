Warm welcome from the staff who helped with luggage and guided us to our room. Room is clean and nice without being fussy or plush. We had a room with a great view of the river. However, our stay was spoilt by noisy trains! I didn't anticipate this problem when booking but please beware. If like me you value tranquility then don't book a hotel along the waters edge like this one. There's a train track that runs both sides of the Rhine. It's very noisy. Perhaps a room at the back of the hotel is better. So, aside from this issue I'd have rated 4 stars. Evening meal was good and breakfast was also nice.", "user": "Tickandbash", "date": "July 21, 2012", "id": 134958440}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "According to various websites, this is a 3* hotel, completely refnovated and refurbished in 1996 -1966 more like!! Dingy and with dated furniture, threadbare bedding and see through towels this hotel resembled a mediocre guesthouse rather than a three star hotel. Car parking is very limited, and although it is possible to park outside whilst luggage is unloaded, no help was available. The breakfast buffet was uninspiring, although the evening meal was surprisingly good. The hotel seems to be run or owned by one man on his own and although friendly his limited english together with the fact he seemed to do everything himself posed obvious problems. The one redeeming factor is the view of the Rhine from the upper front rooms - this was memorable and if I had had a balcony I would have sat and watched for hours.", "title": "great view, little else", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jaspydog", "date": "June 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 16992802, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the view from our room", "disliked": "\u2014 the tired and furniture and linen"}}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Oberwesel"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 1, "very good": 2, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 0}, "aka": "Hotel 'Goldner Pfropfenzieher' Germany/Oberwesel", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
