Just some helpful tips: The hotel is on the corner of 6th ave and 38th street, on 6th you will see a blue sign above a cafe on the corner with the hotel name, then turn the corner to 38th st and the hotel is just a couple doors down, with a green door, press the buzzer to enter. The lobby is one floor up, there is an elevator and stairs, I think there are about 5-6 floors. The lobby has a vending machine for drinks and a stand for pamphlets that have coupons for attractions in the city. We stayed on the 2nd floor, which if I were to do it again, I would ask for a room on a higher level and for a room with a view. The main floor just has too much commotion with cleaning staff and the elevator dinging at all hours. But there are about 15-20 rooms and 4 bathrooms per floor which was never a problem for us, I would suggest using your do not disturb sign when going into the washroom because people tend to try to open the door before knocking. The room itself was small for two people but it was enough for the price. There is a little closet with hangers, a desk, chair, sink, and mirror. The cleaning staff bring fresh towels every day and tidy the room. I would recommend bringing a wash cloth or loofah to help scrub off the layers of sweat from walking in the city. There is free cable in your room which is awesome. The walls are super thin so you can hear everyone walking around and the cleaning staff are really loud in the morning, try a higher floor and maybe it wouldn't be a problem. Overall the hotel was pretty nice, if you're looking for a place to keep your stuff and crash for the night, this hotel works. It is right near bryant park and times square, its within walking distance to central park, its a great location especially for the price. If you're on a budget but want to have fun exploring the city, I would recommend this hotel.", "title": "Great Location for a Budget Hotel", "user": "ransom1", "date": "February 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 56662863}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Tis hotel is well located, in the heart of new york, everything is close by,,,the rooms are average what you could expect for a budget hotel, but clean! service from the staff was very helpful, i stayed during the NYE so it was pretty busy but the staff always found time to help out, overall is well located is cheap but clean and the staff is helpfull.

Was noisy from outside streets---but hey, NYC is the city that never sleeps anyway. Could ask for an inside room that is somewhat helpful. Soap/shampoo/towels included everyday by cleaning staff. Like the convenient kitchenetts with fridge and microwave. Staff is very friendly and helpful; got my needed wakeup call at 4:00 am; and luggage held in office after checkout. Was appreciative of honest staff: friend lost white bathrobe---by accidental pickup upon room cleanup---reported to staff and was located by housekeeping and returned!
