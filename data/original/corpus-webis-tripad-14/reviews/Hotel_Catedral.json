We met our guide at the Cathedral of Guadalupe as we were joining a tour already in progress. We waited for 15 minutes for a inconsiderate lady who was more interested in shopping than going to the pyramids. She is a whole different story I wont get into that it is still too fresh lol. On the way to the pyramids we stopped at a obsidian art factory. Had a tour of the facility and were then rushed into the store to have the chance to spend thousands of dollars on masks and figurines. No thanks. Where are the pyramids? After the tourist trap we arrived finally at the pyramids. To truly appreciate where you are you need to spend at least 3 hours.

We were brought a little bowl of guacamole, 4 chips and 4 pork rinds. When we got the bill we found out they charged us 100 pesos for 1 peso worth of guacamole. So instead of spending 1 hour more at the pyramids we were brought to a tourist trap and hosed on guacamole. Not a happy tour van after that. So dont use Roldan tours.

The entire hotel is clean and tidy, there were always at least two or three members of staff on the reception if you needed anything. There is a restaurant in the hotel but we only used it once or twice for breakfast (until we discovered Sanbournes!) but the service and quality was fine. We decided to go for the Junior Suite which had a gigantic bed (possibly bigger than king-sized??) and a power shower and jacuzzi in the bathroom...I can't remember exactly how much it cost now but it was something like \u00a325 per night which was fantastic value.
