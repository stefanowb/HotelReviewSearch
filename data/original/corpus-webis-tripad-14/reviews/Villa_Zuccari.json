The rooms are very large and airy and the quality of the renovations and furnishings is absolutely superb...and because the summer temperatures were very warm, we appreciated that the air conditioning worked very well.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 6, 2006", "id": 5432433}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "The dining facilities and pool are first rate, and the meals in the restaurant were among the finest we have had in Italy.

This villa has been in the Zuccari family since 1600 and has been lovingly restored. The rooms are enormous with hand painted walls, air conditioning that works great, huge tub, huge shower, lots of hot water and a sitting room. Most of the rooms have balconies that overlook 40,000 meters of land with wheat, sunflowers and grapes. The beds are fantastic, kingsize with lots of pillows! The breakfast room is open and airy with handpainted frescoes on the walls and ceiling. The food in the beautiful dining room is excellent and of course there is the Montefalco wine! Signora Zuccari prepares the menu daily so everything is fresh. The staff are english speaking and can arrange wine tasting and olive oil tasting tours. They will arrange reservations at other restaurants in the area as well. The villa is conveniently located to Foligno, Spoleto, Perugia, Assisi, Trevi, Spello and Bevagna. There is a large parking area if you rent a car but there is a bus stop outside that take you to Spoleto and surrounding areas. Now for the ouside! The grounds are lovely with an infinity pool that is almost olympic size. Lounge chairs, umbrellas, towels, you name it. There is a terazza that overlooks the park like groundsand swimming pool where you can have an afternoon drink. This place has all the modern amenities BUT it still feels like you are staying in someone's home. Signore and Signora Zuccari and their staff are helpful and do everything to make your stay as wonderful as possible. We will be back!

Rooms are very large, nicely decorated with original period furnitures, mine was a very large: a junior suite with terrace at the second floor with view of all the countryside almost up Spoleto's hill. We have also enjoyed a dinner at the restaurant where typical dishes of the Umbria tradition are served with a familiar atmosphere. The entrance have its original wood carved ceiling which is a masterpiece as well as the living room area with a fireplace decorated with very nice antique furnitures and collections, cosy and relaxing.

Contrary to another Trip Advisor\u2019s opinion that the Villa Zuccari was bland, we found it to not be a 4-star hotel, but instead it is more like a 5-star hotel! We stayed in the Villa for 4 great days in May 2006 and we particularly enjoyed the fact that the Villa is in a small village, but is within just a few kilometers of Spoleto, Perugia, Assisi, Deruta, and many other small and interesting Umbrian towns. The suite we occupied was large, airy, had a great view, and had all the amenities of a 5-star hotel. The service was impeccable and the Villa\u2019s restaurant employs a lady to cook who is from the small village and the food was some of the best we found while in Umbria (we particularly liked the veal limone!)! As a retired Hotel General Manager, I firmly believe that Mr. & Mrs. Zuccari, have truly created another fantastic hotel (they also own the Hotel San Luca in Spoleto) that will become a must-stay location for people vacationing in Umbria.
