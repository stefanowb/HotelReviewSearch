Don't be put off by the outside appearance which looks very plain. When booking we had requested a room at the front of the hotel and although it was late at night and dark when we arrived we awoke in the morning to a lovely view of the sea and the snow - capped mountains beyond. Our room, although not huge, was simply furnished and spotlessly clean as was the en-suite. Tea and coffee making facilities were also provided. It was also lovely and warm. There was a good selection at the buffet breakfast. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful. We had to check out at 5am on the day we were leaving due to an early flight and the hotel provided us with tea and coffee before we left and sandwiches to take with us which was greatly appreciated. The Flybus also collected us right outside the hotel which was great. The only criticism we would have is that on the website for the hotel it states that it is only a few minutes walk to the centre of town when in fact it takes about 15 minutes. This did not really worry us but some people might prefer to stay closer to the centre. We would definitely stay at the Hotel Bjork again - it was very pleasant and excellent value for the reasonable price that we paid.", "title": "A very pleasant hotel at a reasonable price.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "gil1956", "date": "April 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 28892260}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Staff were friendly and helpful....toilet not working in our room on arrival and we were immediately given another room (room 203) - nice and large and clean and tidy - breakfast was continental but with plenty of choice...cereals, toast, bread, cheese, ham, yogart, tomatoes, fresh orange juice, tea and coffee.

Both hotels had a very nice breakfast bar in the restaurants attached to the hotels (the restaurants open an hour early so that hotel guest can get breakfast before opening to the general public). The breakfast bar was better at 4th St. Hotel and it had a small bar/lounging area for guest, it was a tad more \u201ctrendy\u201d but it had much smaller rooms with sound issues. Hotel Bjork had spacious rooms, free internet access in the lobby, (which was a must for me) and the restaurant connected to the hotel was nice, yet (comparatively) reasonably priced and great for dinners or a quick drink. I thought the Bjork location was great \u2013 just a couple of blocks from city center so there was not a sound issue, but close enough that I could wear heals and walk to the downtown area with no problem.

We found Reykjavik itself to be disappointing - and would not wish to spend a weekend here but we used it as a base and went on 3 trips which were fantastic. the Golden Circle tour, South Coast trip and the Snaefellsness Peninsular. The scenery on each tour was breathtaking: geysers, waterfalls to walk behind, craters, mudpools, black sand beaches and the glacier - the landscape here was as i imagine the moon to be.
