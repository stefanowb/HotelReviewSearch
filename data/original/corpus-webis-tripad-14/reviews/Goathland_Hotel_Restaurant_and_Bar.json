Called in to the Goathland Hotel today 4 adults and 2 children, (14 and 12). We were told quite politely we couldn't be in the bar as they did not have a 'Children's License' and instead had to go in the 'Family Room' a room at the back so devoid of atmosphere it almost sucked the life out of you. To encourage us that this was the place to be we were told there were lots of memorabilia of Heartbeat?? consisting of a TV with a loop of photos from around the area and an aged photo of the cast of the TV programme, - how long can this place trade on this connection??. The room was dark fusty and miserable. If you have to have families rooms away from the bar for goodness sake make them welcoming and not depressing we felt as though we were second class citizens I have never felt more unwelcome than this.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HEY63", "date": "February 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 151316327}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Flat Beer & Grumpy Staff", "text": "For a Hotel/Pub you expect good service and happy staff.
