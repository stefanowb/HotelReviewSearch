Clean, comfortable rooms, but a few things struck me as unusual. First, the \"free wi-fi\" was only for Marriott Rewards members -- which costs nothing to join, so it's just in inconvenience before accessing the internet. Second, the layout of the public spaces was a little tortured -- to get to the pool, you needed to first go downstairs, through all the conferences areas, then upstairs to the pool entrance, and the entrances to the restaurants were neither clearly marked nor visible from the registration area. Other than that, the rooms were pretty much what you'd expect from a Marriott Renaissance, and the group rate for the curling event (of $89/night) was not bad at all. The staff were all friendly and helpful, although the way the parking lot was cleared after an overnight snowfall left a bit to be desired.", "title": "Comfortable stay, but odd layout", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ABCWorldVacations", "date": "February 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153300709}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "This is definitely an average hotel that could use a facelift.

It is a very old hotel, yet renovated well, and probably as best they can do without tearing it down. Rates are not insignificant compared to what you'd expect of a Marriott Renaissance Hotel. Beds were comfortable. But there is room for improvement. For example, the windows are well over 30 years old, and this winter ice formed quite a bit on the inside of the windows. The type of heater/AC on the wall is the kind I always despise as they are noisy and not well suited to a supposedly classy hotel. One of our rooms had considerable water on the carpet under the heater/AC. They probably should have replaced the bathtubs rather than resurfacing them, as around the drain there is heavy caulking and some rust. Also, heavy caulking on the floor next to the tub. Better workmanship would have made this decision better. The towels and linen were excellent.

I would describe the decor as Funky conservative. Loungey purples, crystal bling, silvery mirrors and dark contrasts. Very modern and hip. The rooms were nicely appointed as well. This is where you discover that this place is still an older building behind the face lift. The doors make a lot of noise when they close, which can be heard as other people enter their rooms at night. Although it's been redone, the bathroom is quite small, a tight fit to get in and close the door. The shower head sprays great, however it is low. It should have an extension that places the showerhead higher and more in the center. A little shelf would be good too. I think the people that design these things should actually use them. Think about it, look at the size of the shampoo and conditioner bottles, they are quite small and where can you put them so that the cap doesn't go slipping in the tub and so you don't have to bend down to get them. Anyway back to the room. TV's are new flat screens the room I had was a king size which left plenty of room to be in. The chair was nice and the heating system operated well. A fridge is always nice to have. The Service at this place is very good. Try the breakfast buffet. It was fresh and i thought a good value for this service.
