It didn't turn out to affect my stay much because I was never in my room during the day. By the time I would get back to my room in the late evening, the workers had gone home and all was quiet.

After doing extensive research and checking other reviews for different hotels, I decieded to go with the embassy suites in irvine califorina. Although check in was'nt until 3:00pm we arrive in irvine at 11:00am we were unable to check in because it was to early, but the hotel did let us check in at 1:00pm. Upon checking in I was very impressed with the way the hotel looked from the outside and also the inside. The kids and I obtained the room key and proceeded to our room while my husband parked the car. The room was very spacousand clean. For the price that we paid I was very impressed, (110.00 night hotel.com non-refundable rate). The bed was very comforable, the room also had a microwave and a refridgator in it, the bathtud was very clean and so were the towels. The best part about the trip was the free buffet breakfast that was served (YES I SAID FREE!!!!) breakfast was served 7:30am- 9:30am, so we didnt have to wake up at the crack of dawn to eat breakfast. The chef fixed anything from french toast to any kind of omlet you wanted to ordered not to mention cold cereals, fruit, bagels, hash browns, ect. and for the adults we had happy hour from 5:30-7:30, FREE DRINKS, (YES I SAID FREE DRINKS!!!!!!!!!!) the only complaint that I have about the hotel was that it wasnt very kid friendly, the only thing the kids had to do was swim, and if your playing basketball there is no swimming until the touraments are over. The lady in the gift shop was a very sweet older lady, pleasant every time we went in.

I did my research on biddingfortravel.com and bid $45 for a 2.5 star in Irvine- I was so happy I got this hotel I can't even tell you. Honestly, they lost money on us- we checked in about 5pm on Saturday, easy as can be, you do have to pay for parking garage, but its close and convenient. At 5:30pm the managers reception with all you can drink (any kind!) for all the family and snacks- that night was nachos & chips with salsa and peanuts. For the four of us, that alone was worth $45 had we been at a restaurant, then we went to the pool and spa, it was nice enough, on the small side, because there was lots of loud kids & tipsy parents there.... the kids were throwing balls hard at each other, not the best. Anyway- the exercise room looked nice, updated equipment, if small. Our room was, yes 80s-ish, but big enough, with seperate bedroom, hurray, and fold out couch, plus room for the pack and play- 2 tvs. THere was a basketball team and a christian group staying there as well, so the place was packed. We were on the 9th floor and the kids loved the glass elevators. AND now for the great part- was the breakfast in the morning! Cooked to order- omlettes, waffles, pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns, toast, bagels, donuts, fruit, juice, coffee, yogurt- extensive. Awesome! And check out wasn't till 1pm. No one wanted to go down to the line, so i went back and forth to the room 5 times bringing up food for everyone before the lines got long- what a bargain- happy mom & happy dad + happy kids. Side note is that the in house restaurant used to be called the Main Street Grille is now the Ha Penny- they have a 2-4-1 coupon in the entertainment books- it says Main Street Grille, but they still accept the coupon- don't waste your money on the entrees- stick to the sandwiches- and they do serve kids dishes like grilled cheese, plus you can bring over your free drinks from the happy hour and there is a big screen TV there, that night was showing the simpsons, so kids were quiet as could be :) And this place is about 3 miles from the Irvine Wild Waters Water Park and about 5 miles from the beach.", "title": "Can't beat $45- free drinks/breakfast", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BellatrixBabe", "date": "May 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7684339, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great freebies- drinks, snacks, breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 Outdated decor"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Things I liked:", "title": "Great rooms & breakfast.
