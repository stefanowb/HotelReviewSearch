I was looking forward to checking in. This place is divide into two sections. A motel area, with outside access to the rooms. And a hotel area, inside access to the rooms. My room was in the hotel section. Checking in was fast and simple. Was given directions to my room and off I went. Drove around to rear parking lot. Unloaded our luggage and headed to the door. First thing I noticed was a lack of security. At most hotel/motels nowadays. You need your room key to enter a side entrance to the building. Not at this place! Anybody off the street could waltz right in. That gave me an uneasy feeling even before I saw my room. Making our way down the hall to our room. The doors to all the rooms were very narrow. Looked like the door you would see on a closet. If you're a big person and have a nice size piece of luggage. No way your going through these entrance ways without a problem! Upon entering the room I smelled the unmistakeable odor of paint. It was strong and bothersome. I immediately turned the air conditioner on and opened the sliding patio door. Hoping it would help dissipate the odor. It didn't. After being in the room for approximately 30 minutes. I decided to call the front desk to see about getting another room. Told her the problem and before i could even finish. Was told they were all booked up, sorry. She said she would have maintenance come up and spray odor neutralizer in our room. Well I thought that was better than nothing. So we left the room to meet our friends for dinner. Hoping when we returned the foul stench was gone. Returned from dinner to find nothing different. Odor still strong as ever.", "title": "THIS IS NOT A RESORT OF ANY KIND...", "user": "jeedude", "date": "June 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 67124950}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled with family", "text": "As for the room it self. Nothing special at all. Bathroom vanity and sink were new. Toilet also. Toilet was set unusually far from the wall behind it. Making it jut out. Sink was very shallow and had a flat bottom. Like most men out there. You need to fill the sink with hot water to shave and rinse the razor properly. Not with this sink. Only 2 inches deep if that! And the final kicker about this not so nice place was the remote control. Was a generic cheapo model they didn't take the time to program to the television in the room. Which was equally as cheap. Bottom line, this place cut corners left and right. The paint odor I attribute to the use of a very poor quality paint. Was told by the front desk.

I called Howard Johnson's on Saturday (7/24) and told the representative that I wanted to use the \"Room Saver\" coupon and was wondering how availability looked for the week of 7/25. I was told there were 18 rooms available and I would get a room with two double beds for the coupon rate of $89.00. Upon arrival on 7/26, I was told by the desk clerk that there were no rooms available at the $89.00 rate, but I could get a room for $119.00. When I asked if I could use my AARP discount, I was told that I could, so that brought the rate down to $113.00, and I was also offered immediate early check-in which was very much welcomed after the four hour drive, so we decided to stay here. We were not disappointed except for one problem. When I opened the hotel room door, my nephew screamed out, \"this room stinks!\" After a few hours I realized the room smelled like it was recently painted, but there is painting going on now on the hotel exterior and it was very hot, but no matter why the paint smell is in the room, it was not pleasant, and it was worse for me because I have an inhalant allergy and get headaches from the smell of paint. I noticed when the air conditioner was running, the smell wasn't so noticeable, but when it automatically turned off during it's cycle, the paint smell was very noticeable again. A nice breeze was blowing during part of our stay so I would open the sliding door to try and get some fresh air in the room, but it didn't help much.", "title": "Very nice stay except for a few glitches......", "user": "jacal", "date": "July 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 72999601}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Besides the paint problem, our stay was wonderful, we all enjoyed the good sized outdoor pool, the water temperature was cool enough to be refreshing, but not too cold, and the picnic tables on the property came in handy, we ate on them several times, and there was a small view of the lake from the picnic tables and our room, unfortunately much of the view is blocked by trees. The restaurant has a great breakfast at a reasonable price. The hotel staff was very nice, helpful and friendly, the maid even offered me help to carry my luggage to the room, I refused help very thankfully, but I was very impressed by her kind gesture! The room came with a nice size fridge, it was about three feet high, not a real tiny mini-fridge that most hotels have, and it held all of our food items handily, even big juice bottles.

There was nothing exceptional about the place you get what you pay for-which is a semi decent room that could use lots of touch up in furnishing. There is a damp smell to the room so you need to keep the AC on. Everything looks old if you stare long enough. Customer service was okay- again nothing exceptional. If you are doing a short weekend getaway and just need a place to sleep then this place will be okay. If you are expecting anything remotely extravagant then I suggest you go elsewhere. The outdoor pool was nice, a bit cold a first but you get adjusted to it. There were a lot of people enjoying their time by the pool. The indoor pool was very small and not that clean. Close to the major lake george village so that was nice. For the price, I would expect breakfeast to be included but it wasnt.
