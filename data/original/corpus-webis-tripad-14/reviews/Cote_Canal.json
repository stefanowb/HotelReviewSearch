Every room at this charming B & B is decorated with impeccable taste -- Caroline could have another career as an interior decorator!! - we were able to see 3 rooms (I stayed in the attic room with my daughter & a friend stayed in both the La Charpente & Clin d\u2019Oeil rooms). In addition to the large, spotlessly clean rooms Caroline provides all of the amenities of a 5-star hotel -- bathrobes, slippers, high quality toiletries, refrigerator, coffee/tea maker & Belgium chocolates. The location on the canal is stunning as is Caroline's garden. Breakfast is sumptuous with a wide selection of pastries, breads, cheeses, meats, eggs, cereals, & jams & honey from Belgium -- also freshly squeezed orange juice - the breakfast room is beautiful or you can choose to eat in the garden. Caroline is passionate about her job & a perfectionist regarding her B & B. She has definitely worked hard to discover the \"formula\" for running a successful B & B.
