The house is in a quiet cul de sac and is a short uphill walk from the centre of Fowey. We were greeted by Vivien, the owener, in a friendly and efficient manner and after a few minuted we felt as if we had known her for years, she even had a selection of maps and local information leaflets ready for us. There are just 2 letting rooms in her lovely home and ours had a view over the garden whilst the other room enjoys a river view. Our en-suite bathroom had a spacious shower and there was a large selection of toiletries and clean towels.
