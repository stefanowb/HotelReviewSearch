The couple that own it couldn't do enough to make myself and my friend feel at home but didn't ever cross that fine line to become creepy or intrusive - you just knew they would be happy to help if there was anything you needed. The room was extremely comfortable and well maintained, the place very well situated and the breakfast hearty and freshly cooked (the mushrooms were especially good!).

As we were the only guests in for the weekend, she very kindly upgraded us to the biggest room, for no extra charge. The room was spacious and nicely decorated and was spotlessly clean. Bed linen was also lovely and fresh and we both enjoyed a high quality, fresh breakfast on both mornings. Sharon was so helpful in giving us advice on the area and where to visit and to eat in the evening. We followed her advice and read the guides and maps she lent us, and saw some amazing sights followed by a beautiful meal in a fantastic French restaurant ('The Crow's Nest' ) which was the perfect birthday meal for me!
