Soon we noticed there was a lot of noise coming from the air conditioning units on the roof. When I asked about it the woman at the desk seemed not to know about it and, in any case, told me there were no other rooms available. The following day we asked for and got relocated to a room one floor lower. This room was tiny with barely room for our suitcases. We had to put one in front of the door. Also this room, unlike the first, had a bathtub with telephone shower which I am not fond of. Towels were of the linen style variety and not very effective, but the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean.", "title": "Great location, tiny room, decent breakfast", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JohnAndTheresa", "date": "September 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140861351}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We later discovered that the noise was from a malfunctioning AC unit which was fixed the next day.", "title": "In the heart of old town", "user": "Jamie604", "date": "September 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140745263}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012", "text": "Location was ideal for exploration of Sorrento and for ferry trips to the Amalfi Coast and Capri.
