The only gripe that I have with this hotel is that they while the offer free Wi-Fi in the lobby, there is an about $15 daily fee to access from your room.

We always stop in Jacksonville on our way to South Florida and try to stay at the Hyatt whenever possible. The river views are stunning, and the hotel windows open so you can have the feel of having a balcony. The A/C does turn off when you open the windows, but if the weather permits, the open air feel is worth it! There are several restaurants nearby at Jacksonville Landing, so you can park your car and walk to dinner or shopping. There is a paved path along the river perfect for a walk or run, and you can traverse the Alsop bridge to get views from the other side of the river. Although we've never been to a Jags game, the stadium is close and you can take the water taxi to get there. The only negative I can think of is that there is no free wifi in the hotel rooms. There is free (slow) wifi in the lobby. The employees are professional and kind. We always have a great experience here.", "title": "After multiple stays, still not disappointed!

The front staff and concierge need to better understand what transportation is available at the hotel. As I had booked a hotel recommended company to transport me from the airport to the hotel, I spoke with two employees who had never heard of the company I booked with, while trying to arrange a later transport after landing late. I was present for the housekeeping to clean the room on two occasions and I was very impressed on their efficient detail and kindness to ask if I needed anything else. Many staff in the halls asked if I needed assistance on several occasions. Although the front desk staff was very kind and patient, I experienced mistakes on more than one occasion, and had a lot of trouble understanding their explanations due to accent and grammar. I was definitely not happy with their practice of charging my credit card. I have never had a hotel debit my card one time per day for each night. I have had either full amounts at the beginning of my stay or at the end; and typically it has always been at the end of the stay. While this is fine for non-business, this becomes quite the pain, when I have to budget food expenses, hotel stay, travel etc. I am waiting for the authorizations to post, as they accidentally over-charged me. I called the hotel, and they assured me it would be fixed.

Amazing to me that there was only a very basic selection of TV channels and there was no HD. Please, you get HD channels at most Hampton or Fairfield Inns and they can\u2019t swing it at a Hyatt Regency? I tried to get hot water at 5PM, and after literally running water for 20 minutes barely luke-warm was all I could get. (This wastes a LOT of water by the way). Hotel restaurants were expensive, no breakfast places within easy walking distance. There are a number of restaurants 2-3 blocks away in the Jacksonville Landing area on the river for lunch or dinner.
