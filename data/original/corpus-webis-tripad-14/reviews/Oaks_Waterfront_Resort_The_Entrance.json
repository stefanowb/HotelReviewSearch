We requested, and paid for, an additonal bed but this wasn't set up nor was the extra linen or towels. No tea/coffee/milk in room or hair dryer - when we contacted reception they wouldn't deliver - we had to go and collect. Due to torrential rain at the time of our stay most of the cafe/restaurants in the vacinity weren't accessable or open which meant we were restricted to using the restaurant within hotel, what a disaster.

We stayed from 24th January for 4 nights, in a one bedroom water view. The view was lovely from the balcony apart from the fact that we were in Room 105, which as it was over the awning at the front of the hotel had a ledge in front of the balcony that was coverered in pebbles & also a whole lot of rubbish that was obviously thrown from balconies above. I rang reception and asked if the rubbish which consisted of poppa juices, cotton buds, those popper things with streamers which must have been there from NYE and other stuff, the girl said they were trying to get a contracter in to clean it up as their staff could not go out on the ledge as they did not have a proper harness.Ok, will live with it then, BUT then when we sitting outside having a drink a hairbrush comes from upstairs, then bread, chips, ok, ring reception & ask if they can ring the units above us & ask them to stop throwing their rubbish down, as then of course when it got dark the ledge was crawling with cockroaches enjoying the bread & other food out there. To make it worse , next thing a waterfall suddenly appears, as the woman above was wringing out her clothes onto our balcony. Well that was the last straw for me, rang reception again & asked for the manger & was told she would be in at 7.30am. So the next morning I spoke with her who just apologised!!! and said she would get someone to clean the area & spray it, which they did, so the next night even though there were cockroaches there were not as many crawling around out there, but we got another shower of water from above, which this time I let the woman above know what I thought and told here she had a bathroom to do that it.Apart from the balcony issue the room was clean & fullfilled all our needs.My other complaint is ( I dont usually complain but for what I paid I expected to enjoy my 4 nights) was the lack of respect other guests have at this time of the year. The pool area needs to be supervised. There were grown men bombing & doing sommersaults in the pool with no regard to other guests. The pool area in the afternoon was disgusting, food & rubbish just thrown on the ground. I never used the spa , it states children under 6 not allowed in the spa, but everyday it was full of babies with nappies on, no babies I saw had the proper swim pants that they should wear when using public pool areas,so I hate to think what could have been under all that foam, and the Gym area states no children under 16, well there were kids running from the pool soaking wet having great fun on the treadmill & other machines in there.Oaks you really need a staff member up at the pool area.I will say the staff were friendy , but not very helpful.Also do not stay in Room 105 for the above reasons, though we had a fantatic view of the Australia Day fireworks from our balcony.
