The room we ended up in was much bigger and better layed out and also faced the rear of the property which was a relief as the previous room faced Springvale Road and traffic noise did keep me awake and wake me through the night. this may not bother you if you are used to it but we are from a really quiet town.", "title": "Wonderful", "user": "velocitynz", "date": "August 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38302810}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled on business", "text": "We were in Melbourne attending a wedding so the location was convienient for us in terms of the wedding venues and also close to family and friends.
