After waiting for too long and for almost being late for our bus departure, we resorted to walking down 17 floors with our equipment. When we arrived back at the hotel after the sugar bowl, chaos ensued and we were forced to walk up to the 17th floor because we needed to retrieve things from the room that needed to be shipped out.", "user": "boyfish", "date": "January 3, 2008", "id": 12304233}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Awful Service and Reservations Are Useless", "text": "The second part was the service.
