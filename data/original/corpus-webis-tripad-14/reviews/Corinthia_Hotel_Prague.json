However, with only slighly elevated temperatures outside, the rooms were uncomfortably hot even with the one window open - which opens only minimally. We were told that the engineers \"were working on the problem\", but nothing changed in the two days we were there. The lobby was nicely air-conditioned, so one can doubt that the problem could be remedied. I would recommend avoiding this hotel in spring and fall \"shoulder\" seasons. The hotel is near the efficient Prague metro subway system, but requires a trip of two stops, a train change, and another two stops to get to the Old Town Square. Getting to the Prague Castle is an even more complex odyssey. There is nothing of cultural or culinary interest near the hotel.", "user": "NJtraveler48", "date": "April 9, 2009", "id": 27683592}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent City Break", "text": "Spent 3 nights here at the end of Feb 09,booked via Hotels.Com 3 nights B&B for the price of 2 .Two hiundred and twenty pounds Business room 2 adults.A great touch was the complimentary bowl of fruit and free use of the Business Lounge(Free Tea Coffee and Internet use.The room 827 was of a good standard.Check in and breakfast supburb.My only complaint was the Hotel was empty and lacked atmosphere,the Hotel restaurants were expensive in comparison to city prices.Location was good although it was a real effort to go back into the city to eat after a day site seeing.The city tour booked via the Hotel was a rip off,not helped by the guide not turning up and the replacement involved translation in 5 languages!!.Stick to genuine Czech cuisine when eating out its much better value and cheaper than Western fare.The Beer is good and the beer museum mut not be missed.Bought an adult 3 day rover pass from the airport 600Czech Kroner for 2 adults and could be used on Bus,Tram and Metro.The Taxi back from the Hotel to the airport was overprioced at 850CZ but necessary due to early Sunday flight", "user": "beamoSuttonColdfield", "date": "April 1, 2009", "id": 27238614}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We had a great time", "text": "We stayed in an Executive Room on the Executive floor and it was great.
