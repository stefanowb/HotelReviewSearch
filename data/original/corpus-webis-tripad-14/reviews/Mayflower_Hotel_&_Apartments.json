I booked an executive double and I am shockingly disturbed by the bad press - because as Sulai informed me Mayflower was the same standard so I went with his guidence. I loved the decor and the juice bar was a gem. I enjoyed the breakfast it was lovely. My only regret is because I was on business and I didnt get to spend more time there. With wi-fi accessibility it's great for business. So next summer I'm going to bring my wife and kids for our holiday to London. Great value for money, clean, welcoming staff and the size of rooms are big compared to European standards. One of the nicest hotel's Iv stayed in London.
