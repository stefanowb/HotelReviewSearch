Secondly the wifi in the rooms was very poor, we had to go to the lobby to get a usable signal, not really an issue for us, but with Disney rolling out my magic plus this year it could become one if not improved.

Our 2 bedroom villa was spacious and comfortable and always a welcome home place after a long, tiring and fun day at any of the Disney parks. Its not cheap here though as the Beach Club is one of the Disney's deluxe resorts but if you can swing it, for me its the place to stay. It sure has a way of adding to the magic that one always feels when coming here.
