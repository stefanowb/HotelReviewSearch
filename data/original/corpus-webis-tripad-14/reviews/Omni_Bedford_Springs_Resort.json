The second evening we had dinner in the Crystal Ballroom (buffet style) and the food was really good, but there was a wedding reception in the ballroom above and you could hear the DJ. They did give us complimentary wine when we complained. I recommed checking if there is a wedding and if so, try one of the other restaurants on-site.
