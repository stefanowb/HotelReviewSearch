The pool is large, very clean and heated. The beach is connected to the property - no need to cross a road or anything else. The front end staff was pleasant. Each room is given one free on site parking spot. This section of OOB is about 10 mins walking from the main \"pier\" area. THIS IS THE PLACE TO STAY!!! There is NO street noise here (unlike hotels closer to the pier) and your section of the beach is always empty and much cleaner. The place looks dumpy from the street but is actually very nice inside. There was a small but usable fridge inside the room. No internet service but my laptop was able to feed off of the free wireless service provided by the OceanWalk hotel from inside our room (reliable signal all 3 nights).
