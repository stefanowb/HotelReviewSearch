The beds were not very comfortable being to hard for all of us. The real problem was that with no air conditioning and old fashioned windows we were eaten and pestered all night by mosquitoes. The staff were very polite and well informed. The security and parking was good but the outside sign is very small. It was a surprise that no food not even breakfast was offered.

Out of the 6 different accommodation we stayed in around Europe, this one was a massive disappointment. Such a beautiful looking place on the internet and from the outside but thats where the good things end. For a self contained cottage, the amount of kitchen utensils was so poor. No kettle, no toaster, no wine glasses, no tea towels, one mug for tea, 4 tiny espresso cups. The equipment between the 2 cottages was so different, we had a share between us all to cook dinner. One of the towels in my parents room had a dirty stain on it. Both towels in our room were damp, and no towel supplied for our toddler. When I requested another one, the hotel manager rudely spoke to me, saying that \" we are not a hotel young lady, if you want hotel you go next door\" before eventually understanding that I didn't want extra, only enough for the three of us. Water for tea had to be boiled on the stove in an old pot that had clearly seen better days. The sponge to wash dishes was so old and should have been thrown out ages ago. There was mould in our shower. The Mosquitos are dreadful, gardens overgrown.... I could go on and on... All I can say is, don't be fooled by the pretty pictures on their Internet site, we were.", "title": "A countryside, in town.", "user": "LondonBray", "date": "June 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 162740150}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We got the hang of using the buses but it was still not as convenient as staying in florence central and while the walk into town is quaint and easy, the walk back is mostly uphill. Still that part was manageable. We found the accomodation mostly misrepresented by the pictures online. We stayed in the cottages at the back, no. 1 and 2. There was an abundance of plastic flowers, a mouldy odour and very little space to put things with the amount of mismatched furniture (mostly used to hold the plastic flowers). While we enjoyed Florence tremendously, we did not look forward to returning to Residence I Colli at the end of the day. The beds in both cottages were either lumpy or squeeky. The bedding really old and worn (although it appeared clean). The tap in the bathroom of one of the cottages dripped constantly. Cooking equipment, pots etc... were not very inviting. Just to make a simple cup of coffee meant boiling water in a rather \"yuk' pot. The place gives the impression of a stingy owner whose standards are set by how much he can take out and less about the comfort of people who are misled to stay there.", "title": "Clean but basic bungalow apartment", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Les W", "date": "May 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 160825168}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Tuscany", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 11, "very good": 11, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 16}, "aka": "Residence i Colli Hotel Florence", "slim_ranking": 0.414364640884, "description": "The Residence \"The Hills\" was made \u200b\u200bin the complex of Villa Pignatti Morano, nestled in a park bordered by the Avenue of the hills, a few steps from Porta Romana and just minutes from the pedestrian area."}
