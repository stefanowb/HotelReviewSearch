From being picked up at the airport by private taxi transfer to being waved goodbye by smiling staff we were made to feel really special. The hotel itself is a landmark building in a great location at the entrance to Valletta, convenient for a stroll into town but surrounded by secluded gardens. Like the previous reviewer, we were not disturbed by road noise either when in our room or outside by the pool, and although the bus terminus is nearby it is actually very quiet in the evenings. This is not a seaside hotel- it's in the middle of a capital city- and perhaps it is sensible to be aware of that if you are seeking peace and quiet when you book. Having initially booked B and B, we told each other we would just try the food once in the main restaurant and ended up eating there every evening, since there was great variety every night from a Maltese evening to an Italian evening and a Sunday barbecue- all beautifully cooked and excellent value for money with free wine on several nights! We can recommend the Club Bar with its great range of drinks, free canapes and amazing friendly service- in fact the service throughout, from the cleaning ladies to the waiters and concierges, was up there with the best we have ever encountered, and I am including the Ritz in London. We felt ourselves to be very safe hands indeed. Our room was just a standard room with no balcony (we felt there was not much point in sitting out on a balcony in a city hotel when there was a good pool and gardens) but the bed was huge and comfortable, with sheets changed on demand and a well-appointed vintage-style bathroom and you could adjust the air-con to your own personal preference. As for drinking water etc. in the rooms- all you had to do was ask and it arrived- anything from water to sticking plasters when the chemist was shut on Sunday evening. We did appreciate the vintage style and decoration of the hotel and in fact that was partly why we booked the Phoenicia.
