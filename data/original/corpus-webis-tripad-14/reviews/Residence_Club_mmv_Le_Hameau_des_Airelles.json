Great bakery next door and good restaurants in the village.

Accomodation was good quality and clean certainly would agree with its 4* rating. However the reception staff were not very informative and lacked knowledge on ski equipment and ski lessons available in the area. The staff could do a little bit to make the atmosphere more socialable, a lovely lounge area but nothing organised (this could be different for the peak holiday weeks in February!). Being able to rent DVDs in reception was very handy and also the availability of board games was another plus too. Montgenevre itself is a fantastic ski resort my only complaint is the ski lessons are far too early 9:15 and also too short at 2.5 hours per day when compared to austria. That said I would definitly return to Montgenevre and the Les Hameau apartments in the future.", "title": "Good apartments", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "westmorland", "date": "January 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 23691954}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Provence", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 19, "very good": 51, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 29}, "aka": "Le Hameau Des Airelles Mmv Residence Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Winter : 110km of ski pistes - all levels - connection between France and Italy + 400km of ski pistes with the via Lattea connectionSUMMER : charming village and exceptioanl environment New SUMMER 13 !> 2 x 1/2 days for free at the mini club> Animation, activities, leisure for free and for the entire family.
