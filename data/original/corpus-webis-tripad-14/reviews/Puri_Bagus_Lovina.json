However, I found myself hankering for the peace and quiet of the Puri Bagus after a while. I loved it so much, I'm going back for Easter. The North coast is the warmest part so you'll enjoy the best weather. The staff are really friendly and go out of your way to help you....well they did for me. I recommend booking an appointment in the open air spa and spending a lazy afternoon in one of the pavillions.
