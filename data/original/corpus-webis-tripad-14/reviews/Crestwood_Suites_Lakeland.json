The motel is the most friendliest, cleanest, most accomodating, beautiful, relaxing and the pool is like an oasis! The only thing missing is a waitress bringing you a pina colado but I am sure that if you requested a drink, the excellent staff would find a way to accomodate! As you can see, I have the highest regards for this motel and everything about it. Our first visit here a few years ago was so exceptional and inviting, we came back for a few more years, they are still so exceptional that we are now moving to the area!

Not a big deal and actually may have worked to our advantage as the non-smoking queen room seemed a little bigger than the smoking king room.
