Not too much English is spoken but you can get by with gestures, believe it or not. Everything was pretty clean, so no complaints there. The showering area was actually onsen-style and if you are not used to traditional Japanese baths, this will be odd. It's an open room with showers along one wall and a large hot-tub style bath, always filled with hot water. You need to rinse off at the showers first (and you do this seated, not standing), take a dip in the hot tub to warm up, go back to the showers where you wash yourself (hair and body), be sure to rinse off completely, and then you go back to the tub to hang for awhile.
