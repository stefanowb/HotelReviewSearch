Problem was at check out when I presented with a bill of over $2800 (should have been less than $285). Two long distance charges were on the bill from day of check-in (when I wasn't even in the room)- each for identical amounts and each over $900. Objected to chgs & was told front desk had no authority to change bill so had to wait for manager. Manager arrived, admitted they had phone probems, said he fixed bill and walked away. 2nd bill still showed balance of over $1800 (which again I objected to). 2nd time manager came down he was quite abrupt and insisted that if I subtracted one figure from the other I would arrive at the amount I actually owed. took over 1/2 hour to finally resolve their error with no apology offered by that manager at any time.

Convenience to the theaters can't be beat. The hotel's parking lot in back made this truly a one-stop holiday. We had a charming room on the top (9th) floor, with great views of downtown and the surrounding hills. Space is a little tight, but this is, after all, an old hotel, and building renovations have been done tastefully. We had a corner room, and I suspect these are the ones to ask for, if you have a choice. We found the accommodations more than adequate, and the pretty decor and amenities made for a very pleasant stay. Members of the staff were friendly and helpful. Before the theater, we had dinner at the hotel's restaurant, Larks. Our meals were delicious (duck breast, pork loin), and the atmosphere was upscale but not fussy.

The location is great if you want to be right down in the heart of beautiful Ashland. But, the big drawback was a continuous high pitched vibration sound coming from the air handling unit. Turning the unit off, did not stop the noise. And, the front desk literally said, \"oh yeah, well that is a problem that every room has. We can't do anything about it\". They were nice enough to give us a free meal at the adjoining restaurant. But, sleep was impossible without using earplugs. It's that loud and annoying.
