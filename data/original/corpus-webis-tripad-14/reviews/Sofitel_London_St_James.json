There was everything you would expect - a flat screen tv, tea and coffee making, a minibar (we didnt use it as it was very expensive) bathrobes, slippers and an amazing bathroom with a seperate bath and shower . The bed was huge and very comfortable. We looked out over Pall Mall and the room was really light. We went down to the bar to get a drink and the bar staff were all really polite and friendly.

We're the kind of travelers that do not set a schedule and sleep in in the morning or take a nap in the afternoon before heading out to the theatre. The room was quiet and we were never disturbed. On the other hand, if we called for extra towels, pillows or toiletries, they were waiting for us when we came home from the theatre. We ate in the Tea Room and Bar a few times and the service was excellent, very friendly and accommodating. On one occasion we were too late for the actual Tea but the waitress went out of her way to get some warm scones & jam for me. Concierge were very friendly, although I must say we did better getting our theatre tickets on our own and ended up with better seats and in one case the Concierge told us there were no tickets available for a particular show and we called and got them ourselves. So, in this day and age, I guess needing a middle man for tickets isn't such a big deal when you can just call the theatre or use your laptop. Oh, and the wireless was free, none of that tacking on another $15 a day for wireless. We were so very comfortable that we felt like our suite was our own little Studio apartment in St. James.
