The Desk agent was nice and upgraded me to a Harborview room being a Plat Priority club member. The same valet brought my bags up to my room. When we walked in we were shocked. Huge, Huge!! Clean room. Massive King size bed and a bathroom that looked like it was something from a Spa. The room was well appointed with a fully stocked Mini Bar, K Cup machine and bath robes. Great bed and good TV selection. We walked downstairs to start to go explore the city when we were stopped by a very nice concierge. Who offered us a great map of Boston, and good eating recommendations, and even gave us an umbrella to use because it was drizzling out. When we got back( 1am) the Front Desk was still fully staffed and very welcoming. We went down to Breakfast and although very expensive the omelets were to die for.
