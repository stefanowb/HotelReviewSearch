Rooms are (very) small but modern, with Sky tv and air conditioning. Communal areas are nice, comfy and clean; pool is pretty big (but it was out of order the first few days we were there); waiters, barwoman, cleaning ladies all friendly and they cared about their guests. Good food, although the buffet is limited compared to most other hotels I've been to in the area. Two nice surprises were an evening with live music and a show and also free tickets for all of us to Mirabilandia (the best theme park on the coast). Beach was really crowded (by the way, umbrella and chairs included in the room rate) but clean and amenities well organised.", "title": "Nice hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DTLondon", "date": "September 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 20138252, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, overall comfort, cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 Small rooms, limited buffet"}}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Emilia-Romagna", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 6, "very good": 15, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 21}, "slim_ranking": 0.644970414201}
