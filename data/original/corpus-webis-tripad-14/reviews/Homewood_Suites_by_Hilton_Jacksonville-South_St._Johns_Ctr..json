(The college is 2 miles away) Our room was nicely furnished, clean and provided everything we needed (and more). Probably the most impressive attribute though, is how wonderfully friendly everyone was. Every employee from housekeeping to maintenance to management, never passed without saying hello and offering a smile. We traveled with a service dog and even how they responded to our scenario, was professional. The hotel is directly next to an amazing shopping area (Ladies, you'll never want to go home!), but the nights were so quiet. Our room backed up to a lake with a beautiful sunrise in the AM, and then we enjoyed our breakfast in a bright and cheery dining area.
