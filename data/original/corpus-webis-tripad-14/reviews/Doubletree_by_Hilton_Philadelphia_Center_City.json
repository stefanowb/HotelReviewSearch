This awakened us repeatedly during the night. The parking garage is a monstrosity. It has very narrow passageways (unsafe for 2-way traffic) and has a poorly-marked exit on the 3rd floor, which we didn't even see until we had returned to the 1-way entrance on the first floor.

Because of the late date and the timing of the Obama/Clinton primary, rooms were at a premium - so we didn't get a great rate. However, we were not disappointed in any way with our stay at this hotel, and we loved our time in Philadelphia. The parking for this hotel is either valet or self-park, and is located adjacent to the hotel. We did self-park for $20 a day, and did not have any difficulties at all getting our bags from the garage to the hotel (as a previous reviewer had experienced). The city is very walk-able, or if you choose, the hotel is right next to the subway line. There are also lots and lots of cabs. We parked the car and didn't take it out until we left. Check-in was uneventful. We got there a bit early and the room wasn't quite ready, but we waited under 15 minutes in the lobby until it was. The lobby is spacious, sunny, and wecoming. The room itself was very nice. We were on the 23rd floor and were very close to the elevators but we did NOT hear any elevator noise the entire time. In fact we barely heard any noise from others at all. The restaurant served a breakfast buffet and two of the three days, we were not charged for our son's breakfast, which we liked, but I guess that's left to the discretion of the waitstaff. The service was always prompt and accommodating. We didn't eat any other meals there, though, as there are a multitude of restaurant choices all over the city. The hotel has a heated pool, fitness center, and a sunning area on the roof. From the inside of the hotel, you have to walk through the fitness center to get to the pool, which I didn't care for. Also, the very small bathroom/shower/locker/sauna area were located across the atrium from the pool and fitness area. To me, it would have made more sense to put it in-between. This is about the only thing I didn't like about the hotel. The location is very good; close to Market and Walnut Street, and not a far walk to the Independence Hall/Liberty Bell area. On a side note, we highly recommend doing the Trolley/Bus tour right away to get an idea of what the city offers. This hotel is one of the stops on the tour, and the bus will also pick up there in the AM if you want to be brought to the tour starting point early in the day to continue your tour (within 24 hours). Housekeeping service was very good and they always made sure to replenish towels, shampoo.
