The front desk staff was very nice and helpful at the check in. We got a remodeled room and an upgrade to a superior room (we booked standard). We had a nice view from our room but you kind of had to be close to the window to see the Chrysler and Empire State building or you had to lean out in order to take a picture of them. But we liked our room and the view very much. We were located at the 30th floor and after sleeping two nights very well (beds are very comfy) a crackling noise started and woke me up in the middle of the night. It was so loud that I couldn't get back to sleep and I ended up using earplugs. The next day we asked at the front desk what this could be and they told us that we probably just forgot to turn off the ac. But we checked everything that night and it was not the ac. In the evening we asked if somebody could check this noise out in our room since we could still hear it. The maintenance guy stopped by and said this crackling noise is the wind and the hotel received a lot of complaints about that recently. The noise got much quieter the next nights and we didn't bother to ask for another room. The concierge helped us with a restaurant reservation at a very nice Italian restaurant. The only real complaint I have is that I asked several times to get a clean comforter (there was a big stain on ours) and after asking four times and they never changed it I was sick of it and just gave up. Another not very nice situation we had was at the check out. The lady who was helping us asked me to fill out a survey. I told her we are in a rush but we would be happy to fill it out and mail it in or do it online. She responded very rude that this is not an option and grabbed the survey from me. I was very unhappy with her reaction and how she treated me during the entire check out procedure. I have to say that you can forget the ladies at the front desk but the guys are very very nice. They always asked us how we like New York and our stay at the Hotel. If we asked the ladies at the front desk (as I asked for a new comforter) they always gave me the impression that they are really annoyed by our requests and treated us disrespectful.", "title": "nice stay but some issues", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "franny26", "date": "December 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 11252470, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The view and location", "disliked": "\u2014 ladies at the front desk, dirty comforter"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We liked our stay at the Millennium though we had some issues but I am not sure if I would return.

Honestly, this is very important to me, I cannot stay in the room with the sealed windows, I get completelly sick, so I always call to the hotel before I do any booking. Anyway - out of all Manhattan' hotels I chose this one ONLY because they promised that I wouold be able to open a window ( a little bit!). Well, it was not true. When I came - they were very friendly, and they pre-register me at 10 a.m. assuring me that my room will be ready by 1 p.m. It was not true either. It was not ready even at 3 p.m. (official check - it time). I was able to get my room only at 4 p.m. It The building looks nice from outside, and the lobby is nice too, but inside - you feel like you are walking Ramada hotel. Not very nice, not very clean. The room has very limited furniture, you feel that one little table at least is missing. The beds are noisy and not comfortable, shaking on the high legs. Don't expect any nice pillows either. Everythign is minimized, but - SURE ENOUGH - you have that expensive mini-bar with the key, so they can charge you more. The toilet is not clean, the actual toilet has dirty stains all over, the water from the sink is leaking, and the water in the shower does not go away. The view howere is terrific, but the window is sealed, you cannot open it so you stay in the air-conditioned room without ay fresh air, and after a night sleeping in such a room your head is heavy and your nose is stuffed, and you have slight cold flu symptoms. I came to the reception and I talked to the Manager Marcos who said that they have other rooms where the window can be indeed open, and he said that they will move me. But = guess what - they did not. WHen I came to the reception again - Marcos was not there, but there was some other girl, and she was rude, she was rolling her eyes like I am asking for a moon from the sky, and she did not even apologize, thus .. it was not very nice. The hotel is full of children, It looks like thay are haveing some group deal overe there, but you do not expect to be right in the middle of the high school when you pay so much for your stay. You feel like you are camping with the bunch of boyscouts. If you do not mind it - sure you can chose this hotel. If you do not mind rude stuff - sure you can chose this hotel. But if you prefer to get a decent service for the money you pay - stay away, this is not a good place. And even your wonderfull view from the sealed window does not help. I also asked for some help to book some tourist tours - and received no assistance. The restaurant is of low quality and sure enough - overpriced. You do not mind to pay more for a good food in NY, but when you pay $60 for piece of meat you expect it to be a good piece at least - but it is not. The food was of Dennis' quality. I would say - this is 2 star motel in a body of high glass building, that's it. THe only advantage is - the location. It is really comfortable.

The hotel is a few blocks from Grand Central Station but you wouldn\u2019t carry suitcases that far. We checked in quite early but they had a room available. Trip Advisor revues had recommended the East Tower so when we were allocated the West Tower we were a little disappointed but they offered to change the room if we unhappy with it, it just meant we wouldn\u2019t be allocated a room until after 3pm. We had requested a quiet room, away from elevators so we were on the 35th floor. When we first went into the room we felt it was a little dated but very clean but both the bedroom and bathroom were huge. The bathroom in particular had great lighting and mirrors and loads of power points. But the best was yet to come. On opening the curtains we were looking straight out on to the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Day or night, the view was fantastic! Meals in the hotel are quite expensive but nearby are some great little cafes and restaurants to eat. Go out of the hotel and turn right and a little way ahead at the corner you will see John\u2019s Caf\u00e9. Every kind of a breakfast served here from about 4 dollars, it\u2019s friendly and very clean but also very busy at peak times. There is a lovely cocktail bar in the hotel but again, expensive. We paid almost 40 dollars for three drinks! It costs 9 dollars for 30minutes to use the hotels internet. If you just want to check or send an email go to the Tourist office in Time Square and you will get free internet access for 10 minutes. We used the Gray Line tour bus to get around to all the sights. It may seem a little expensive but it covers an awful lot and some of the guides are really witty. Also, if you have your ticket bought there is a hop on/off stop at the UN Building right beside the hotel. You can buy a metro card for 7 dollars for 24 hours travel but beware if you are using a credit card to purchase at the vending machines, they do ask for a zip code and if like us in Ireland you don\u2019t have these, then you have to use cash. If you are going to see the Statue of Liberty the wait can be very long but you can always hop on the Staten Island ferry. It takes you across the bay , close to the Statue of Liberty and the views of Manhattan are brilliant. Also it\u2019s FREE. Just cross and return straight away, you\u2019ll get the same views as people paying 25 dollars for a cruise trip.

It certainly has some 'higher end' trappings, such as the impressively stocked bar, concierge service and leisure facilities but you will, if you're placed in the west tower, be disappointed by the quality of the room. I'm unaware if there are plans to upgrade all the rooms to the standard of those in the east tower but if this was to be done then a 4 star rating would be appropriate. Given the absence of balconies in most New York hotels it is apparent that smoking is permitted in rooms. I was disappointed that I was not given the option of a smoking or non-smoking room on arrival but I'm unsure if this was available. There was a odour in the room upon our arrival but this soon disappated. I personally wasn't that pertrubed given the aged nature of the room. This is New York City - how much time are you going to spend in there! The views from our room was nothing short of breathtaking and considering this our first visit to NYC we couldn't have asked for anything better. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant. I believe this hotel to mainly cater for business travellers and the hotel bar and restaurant prices reflect this ($25 for two bottles of beer and a diet coke!). But there are a multitude of eating options in the immediate area and the concierge has no problem in advising various eateries (the concierge called Ferris was particularly helpful). I'd read other reviewers referring to John's Diner and this became our breakfast location everyday. Good quality food, reasonably priced and it is the authentic american diner experience to boot. All rooms boast a mini-bar but prices are high ($7 for a beer) considering the accessability of pharmacies and stores in the immediate area, which offer greater chioce anyway. The hotel's leisure facilities are, besides the rooms views, the major selling point. No other hotel in Manhattan apparently offers a swimming pool and tennis court in it's complex. The pool can get busy early in the day as it's used by staff from the UN as they can purchase membership but after 09.30hrs it is generally quiet.

When we arrived, the desk clerk mentioned that we could only get \"certain rooms\" since we booked thru hotwire. Though, I asked for a high floor, and he did put us on the top floor (40th), so I was happy about that. However, this was NOT a 4 star room at all. It was in tower which has not been remodeled yet. It was a huge room, and had a kitchen with a stove and frige, which was unexpected. It was a very old kitchen though and we had no intention of using it. The floor tile in the bathroom was broken and your foot would catch on it each time you go in. The tub drained so slowly you stood in inches of water to shower. The room smelled strongly of smoke though we asked for nonsmoking. And the worst was the bed- it was so old and hard, and you could feel the springs through the sheet- I truly could not believe it. The next morning I asked for a different room with a \"newer bed\" and we were quickly given a room in the other tower that had been remodeled and was 100 times better! What a relief. It was much smaller, but I did not care- it felt clean and new and nice. We were very happy with that room and the views are wonderful. The tempting snacks on the counter are insane prices- $3.50 for a small bag of m&ms, for example. The staff was wonderful for sure. But, we saw an enormous difference in quality between the 2 rooms, so I strongly suggest requesting a remodeled room if you book here!!", "title": "Great View!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "recgator", "date": "July 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8206084, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 View"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Since I read other posted reviews prior our stay I knew what to expect since we got our room booking via Hotwire. As promised, we were given one of the West Tower (non-renovated) rooms, but we were given an option to upgrade for an additional $30 dollars per night. Since we only paid $142 per night to start, this would have been a great deal. Having a lack of food in me and not thinking clearly, we decided not to take the upgrade until we came back from lunch, and then they no longer had non-smoking rooms available. Regardless, the room was spacious. A stain on the carpet and a few mildew stains in the tile grout was not a big deal to us; the room size and view made up for it. We would have appreciated an upgraded mattress (it is a little too firm), but being so tired from going all day and staying out late actually made the bed feel more comfortable.
