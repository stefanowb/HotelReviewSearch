{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 728, "name": "One & Only Palmilla Resort", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "This Palmilla measures up against the finest resorts. Its positives begin by being closer to the Cabo airport than most other high end resorts. It is secluded but completely self contained. If you must leave, the fun old town is a 10 minute ($15) taxi ride away. Cabo San Lucas, for tourist stuff and nightlife, is further away. So, Palmilla is expensive but the gorgeous beach (one part is swimmable), delightful and traditional rooms and villas, excellent bar-restaurants, and spa services make it worth the money. Perhaps what separates Palmilla from other very similar resorts is its staff. There are a ton on duty and they are charming and always helpful. We especially enjoyed the complimentary beach cabanas with constant staff attention. One item that we thought might be a concern turned out not to be. Fancy Cabo resorts tend to attract those who want to be seen and see the famous and those who are there to party hard. On our first day we spotted a few of these candidates, but their behavior never got to a level of concern for us. It really is an impressive resort with a staff that makes you want to return.", "title": "Fab Palmilla", "user": "cabdrinker", "date": "June 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 164750562}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I love Cabo and visit quite frequently - but this was our first stay at the One and Only Palmilla.

I have stayed here twice and both times have book a Jr suite because I love the bathroom, it has an open shower and an amazing free standing bath tub. The butler for your room provides you with a sun kit, a hat and delicious little snacks every night. I am a hotel boutique shopper and their boutique doesn't disappoint. They offer Missoni swimwear, Mara Hoffman sun dresses, Louboutin shoes, Stella, and gorgeous pieces of statement jewelry. The massages at the spa were relaxing and not overly complicated or over sold. I got a pedicure and chose their signature polish color \"Palmilla Red\".
