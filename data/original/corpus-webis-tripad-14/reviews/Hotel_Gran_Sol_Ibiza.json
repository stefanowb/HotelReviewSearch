The hotel staff were always friendly and helpful, and the rooms were very clean. The only downfall about the hotel would be the air con, i couldnt breathe when i woke up! But the rooms also have fans so we just used that and it was just as good. There are lots of mirrors - which is handy when there's two girls getting ready! The pool was nice too, i dont understand how this hotel can be a 2 star...i would give it a 5! The location is quite good, far enough from the west end so its very quiet, but still only a 10 minute walk. There is a beach by the hotel, literally about a 2 minute walk, and theres supermarkets on every corner.", "title": "best hotel in San Antonio!!!", "user": "Joey_Sw", "date": "July 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114923058}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011", "text": "This is a good value hotel just a stroll from 'sunset strip' (i.e. Cafe Del Mar and Cafe Mambo).

Breakfast was much better than I expected and at 2\u20ac a pop the bottles of beer at the bar were some of the cheapest bar bought beers we found in Ibiza.

It is only rated as a 2* but do not let this put you off, I would rate it as a 4* without a doubt! It is in an excellent location - 2 mins from the beach (the nice beach in San Antonio - not the horrible one near the West End!), a 5-10 minute walk along to Cafe Mambo / Cafe Del Mar etc, and a 15 minute walk (or a 4 euro taxi ride) from the West End. There's lots of nice cafes / bars / restaurants nearby with beautiful views of the sea. The rooms are basic but very spacious, and we were lucky enough to have a balcony with a sea view! We had air con, a huge fan and a free electronic safe in the room. The hotel pool is really nice too (not massive but big enough), very chilled out - we spent pretty much every day by the pool! We were self catering so I can't comment on the food but if it's as good as everything else in the hotel I'm sure it's great! The staff were very friendly, we literally couldn't have asked for more from this hotel! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who loves Ibiza but would rather keep a distance from the West End experience (we stayed in the West End on our 2 previous holidays and the hotels were horrific).

We stayed half board, and were impressed with both breakfast and dinner (get to breakfast early if you want bacon and eggs though!). It is a 2 minute walk from Kanya, and not much further to Mambo, etc. All the staff are really friendly, and when I had to go to hospital due to an ear infection they put food and drink in our room because we missed dinner. Nice clean pool, cheap drinks (and of course cocktails!), occassionally there was evening entertainment too. 2 lifts (there are 6 floors), very clean, I think all rooms have a balcony, most with sea view.
