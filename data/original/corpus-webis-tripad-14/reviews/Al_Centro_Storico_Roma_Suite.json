The apartment was just like the pictures, very clean and very modern, even has a washing machine, but no dryer, though a drying rack is provided. Lavina was very pleasant and helpful, showed us maps and gave us directions for everywhere we wanted to go. She suggested some helpful apps for our phone that came in handy. The apt. is in a very interesting part of the city, which you might not get to explore if you are not staying there. I would highly recommend this apartment and would stay there again .Our only problem was that they wanted to be paid in cash, but they had not informed us of this prior to our arrival. They said it was something to do with their system being down. We had to notify our bank that we would be taking out larger sums than we had expected. This was a bit off putting and would have liked to have known the arrangement ahead of time.", "title": "A very nice apt. in Rome", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "kyamin", "date": "November 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 184919523}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had 4 great days at Al Centro Storico - Max and Lavinia were the perfect hosts - this is exactly in the right place in the center of Rome - in walking distance of almost every site you need to see in this famous city.", "title": "Great Stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TSJCPJ", "date": "November 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 184829732}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with family", "text": "You are making a big mistake if you book a hotel rather than this apartment.
