The prices were comparable with all other Tel Aviv hotels but the difference is the quality of the rooms (they are clean, well kept and modern - would suit a family ideally) and the general state of the hotel. The only thing I would have wished for in this hotel is a swimming pool but given that the beach is spitting distance (and the hotel even provides the towels) it is not something which would put me off staying here again. I would also mention that although some rooms are stated to be sea view (and do have large amounts of window space) the hotel is set back from the ocean front by another building so it becomes more of a partial sea view and that parking there is hideously expensive but can be found for cheaper nearby.
