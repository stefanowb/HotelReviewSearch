Incredible. And he checked in with us, not intrusively, but thoughtfully, daily - making sure we had our needs met and answering any questions we might have had. I had read on Tripadvisor about the room service breakfasts, but nothing could have prepared us for the incredible food and beauty of the display that arrived on our doorstep early the first morning (at the time of our choosing). The food was healthy and indulgent and considerate and just completely delicious and fresh. They even thought of our kids and how picky kids can be. We were AMAZED. Our kids couldn't wait for breakfast each morning - and they are really picky eaters! The apartment was clean, warm, and the housekeepers kept it clean and lovely every single day.

We stayed in the attic apartment and everything about it was over the top. We travel a lot and have never stayed in such an amazing place for so many reasons. When we saw the room, my husband and I gasped. it has been completely remodeled and has every modern convenience, beautifully decorated. You actually walk down a wide hall from the large, fully equipped kitchen and dining room to the living room and bedroom area. The bathroom is a piece of heaven. Huge bathtub, separate shower, and a heated floor. The bath at the end of the day was sublime. There's a large outdoor patio. The bed was more comfortable than our sleep number at home and it was dark and quiet. It was hard to leave the room to go out sightseeing and shopping. Two ladies bring the breakfast, set it out on the table and you just leave everything on the table and they clean it all up. The view is beyond belief - the clock tower and cathedral are right there out of one of the many windows. Pasquale couldn't be a better host. He was so efficient in our interactions before we arrived I thought he would be \"all business\". That could not be further from the truth. He is laid back, warm, welcoming, and interacts with you as if he's known you for a long time. He walked us around the neighborhood, noting traditional places to eat, main plazas, supermarket, and very good instruction on finding the building when returning to the apartment. The price is extremely reasonable for accommodations in the Old Town even if this was a hotel room, but this was more like a large condo. You must stay here if you come to Prague!!!!!!!!", "title": "Over the top", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "nzbraughton", "date": "December 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147352826}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled with family", "text": "My six year old son and I spent 10 nights staying in the attic apartment.
