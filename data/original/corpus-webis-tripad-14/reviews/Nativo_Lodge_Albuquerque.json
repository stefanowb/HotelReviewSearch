We had a large \"junior suite\" for $95 that had an extremely comfortable king bed, one of the best beds I've had in a hotel in recent memory. Big windows with views of the mountains, big TV, fridge...and outside, there are cultural decorations - even a teepee with chairs and music outside near the (small) pool. The pool is nice because part of it is shaded by a roof for when that scorching summer sun is too much. The staff was very friendly, and there's a great 24-hour Mexican restaurant called Taco Cabana across the street. There's a free shuttle to the casino. There was even a goofy (and free) concert by Sanjaya from American Idol on Saturday night. The weakest link is the room service, but at least it is extremely inexpensive ($22 for breakfast for two??).
