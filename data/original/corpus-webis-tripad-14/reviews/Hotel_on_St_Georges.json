After reading the other reviews and realizing that it is indeed good (if not great!) value for money, I decided to book for a 5-night stay during the end of July '06. The hotel seriously needs a face lift! The interior is quite 80's and everything needs a good dusting. We checked in at 23h00 after a long flight and found the staff all scrambling around when we arrived. There was no drink service in the bar, so they offered to buy us some bottles of water. Good service. Staff was overall a bit \"absent\" and not really perked up when you asked a question at the reception desk. A brochure in the hotel room stated that there was a gym in the building (I knew that there wasn't from the Expedia hotel description, but still wanted to check) and when I asked reception, they seemed dumbfounded. Apparently the hotel had a gym.. like 10 years ago! Doesn't anyone check the brochures to see whether they are up-to-date? Hotel room was clean, but dark and no windows could open. The light in the bathroom kept on flickering and after calling the front desk they offered to repair same the next day (they did). Breakfast was good - you could really fill up for a long day of activity ahead. Fruit juices were just gross (powered stuff).", "title": "OK value for money, but needs a make-over, fast!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "CapeTownBokkie", "date": "September 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 5773779, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good value for money, breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 Outdated interior, unfazed staff, unsafe downtown Cape Town location"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005, traveled on business", "text": "If you on a tight budget, then book the hotel.

Seems though that the \"porter\" (I think he doubles as a Concierge) is not always available on the spot. The Front desk was relatively quiet and the lady had no problems finding our reservation. During our stay, we found that she was one of the friendliest and best staff members on duty there. I believe her name was Sylvia but I'm not sure. We chatted a bit with her on the dead Sunday night and she was a sweetheart. Anyways, to my surprise, she gave us our room right away and just what we had requested, a double non-smoking room. Our non-smoking room had an ashtray (!) with a big X on it. I found that amusing and please be advised that even though they are non-smoking signs on the doors as well as on the elevator landing (\"Non-smoking floor\"), that didn't stop our room neighbors from ligthing up.
