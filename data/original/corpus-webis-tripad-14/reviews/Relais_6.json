However this turned out to be a very slick well run smart boutique hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful, but not overly so. Rooms were large with a separate living area, bathroom and large walk in wardrobe (we stayed in an apartment room), good breakfast although a little samey after a few days. Most of all we enjoyed the lounge area, a really nice place to relax at the end of the day with lots of drinks to choose from and free nibbles/sandwiches included with each drink bought. Our main concern was the distance from the centre, we didn't try the buses but it was only a short 10 minutes walk to the nearest tube (with two small kids in tow) so you could be in central Rome in no time at all.

Every evening, they had drinks and snacks available in their lounge. It was a pleasant way to unwind after a long day touring the city.
