As usual we have been booking Ibis beeing anywhere just for one night, as this was a \"safe\" choice - standard throughout the world so one could be sure what to expect in terms of quality and service. This time we have been staying for one night, having our flight following evening. We wanted to leave our luggage in the hotel for 5 hours after check-out. We have been informed that we'd be additionally charged for each pcs of luggage. No info about that on Ibis/Accor web pages or anywhere else. It's a shame Ibis is charging for the service which traditionally is free in any hotel, was always free in all Acoor hotels and free even in the cheap backpackers hostels. They are not stating on the invoice that the charge is for \"luggage storage\", but \"Shop VATable\". So they are even ashamed themselves to state it clearly.
