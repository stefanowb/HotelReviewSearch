Even though one can't expect Central Park, the greenery outside the window is a nice escape from some of Palermo's gritty concrete buildings.

The fridge was not working of the minibar. So we had a weekend of this 4 star hotel with lukewarm drinks, stinking bed sheets and no toilet paper. In addition to that a taxi company with collaboration with the hotel management, that the hotel booked had an agreement of payment of \u20ac 65 transfer between hotel and Airport. We was fooled to pay \u20ac 270 or we will miss the flight. To rearrange with another taxi company would take an hour for taxi to arrive. That was what the driver did. He took the money before we sat in the taxi and literally thew us out 5 minutes from the hotel. Luckily there was a restaurant nearby we could ask them to call after a taxi. It is so intimidating being in a country a very few can speak English and no legal rights to claim.
