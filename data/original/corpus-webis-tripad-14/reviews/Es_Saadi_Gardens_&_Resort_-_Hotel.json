You are about 15-20 mins walk from the main square and souks so close enough to the main attractions, but set in very peaceful gardens in the modern area of Hivernage. The staff are friendly, very helpful and speak a variety of languages very well. We found the concierge to be particularly helpful and he even spoke to the tour company (who couldn't speak English) for us and was great at getting taxis for us at decent prices. Everywhere is spotlessly clean and a welcome quiet calm away from the famous hustle and bustle of the markets etc. The included breakfast was delicious with plenty of fresh fruit and hot and cold buffet available. Also recommend the Spa as the treatments were great and also of a reasonable price for the standard. We had a great relaxing break thanks to the hotel and definitely made the most of our time in Marrakech by being close enough to the busier areas of the city.", "title": "Great hotel for location and staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "FayeW", "date": "August 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8536492, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The peaceful location whilst still being close to the livelier areas.", "disliked": "\u2014 Sun loungers are packed in a bit too close round the pool."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We've just returned from a 6 night stay at the Es Saadi Hotel in Marrakech and agree completely with Mike from Warrington.

The hotel is truly a 5 star in every way and we are not old 'fuddy duddys' (40's) so don't believe a word about the clientele being old.
