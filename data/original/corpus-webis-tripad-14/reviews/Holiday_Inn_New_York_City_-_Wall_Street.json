We've been to New York several times and this was by far the best experience we've had at an incredible price. The room had been completely redone and was absolutely spotless. Although a bit small by Texas standards, by New York standards, it was good sized. The staff was exceeding polite, friendly, and helpful. Best of all, it was QUIET. It's directly across the street from the Federal Reserve Bank so after 5:00 p.m., the traffic drops off and it's like a quiet neighborhood. There are several good (and cheap!) eating places nearby and it's only two blocks from the metro station. You can walk to most all of the sights in lower Manhattan without any trouble - very safe and very convenient. We'll definitely be back!", "title": "Great hotel!", "user": "SusanD55", "date": "August 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 39107209}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in Hotel Reserve for the last two nights of our 3 week break in USA. Our room was only just big enough for 2 adults & 2 teenagers. Admittedly, though, it was well decorated, clean & comfortable. We spent very little time actually in the hotel but the staff we met were, mostly, friendly & helpful. We were very disappointed to find that the charge for leaving our luggage between checkout and our departure 7 hours later, was $3 per bag! We felt this was unreasonable and had not experienced such a charge anywhere else on our trip. For this reason alone, we would be cautious in recommending the hotel.", "title": "slightly disappointed", "user": "Parkavenue34", "date": "August 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 38972154}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We spent the week of July 11-18 in New York City, staying at the Hotel Reserve.

Well, the front desk clerk (none of those knuckleheads wore name tags, so you never knew who you were dealing with) informed us that they did not have a second room with two double beds so someone was going to have to use a blow up air mattress. I was very angry and they finally agreed to change our room. After the clerk convinced me that the air mattress would be \u201cperfect\u201d for our very petite mother, we went ahead and took the single bed room.
