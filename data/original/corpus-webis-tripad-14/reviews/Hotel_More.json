Our view was so nice we didn't leave the room except for dinner for our first day! Our room had a jacuzzi tub, which was nice, although there was no way of turning the jets off from the tub; the switch was next to the light switch just outside of the bathroom, which I thought was strange.

One big problem with the bathroom, though, was the lighting. There is no lighting over the mirror, and the overall lighting is pretty dismal.

The king bed was actually two twin beds pushed together and separately made--separate sheets, separate twin-size blankets, etc. Considering we were on our honeymoon, this made snuggling pretty difficult. The location is great for the sea views, but quite a distance away from Old City and not very easy to get to. The hotel told us to wait for the #5 bus down the road and that the bus came every 20 minutes or so. We waited and waited and waited. After wasting about 45 minutes waiting for the bus, the staff from the hotel behind the bus stop told us that the bus was not running on that route anymore. I was so frustrated with wasting so much time we just grabbed the taxi that was dropping someone off there. Considering the distance, a shuttle between the hotel and Old City would be a great touch. We were also unaware of a great promenade with lots of restaurants just steps from our hotel on the beach side (and by beach, I don't mean beach--there is no real beach at the hotel itself).
