Before booking I had read some reviews that commented on the sketchy location. I'm glad we chose Bijout anyway; here's what we found: The hotel is on the corner, and the front entrance (and parking) is on a relatively quiet street. To the west is the Tenderloin neighborhood, which can be intimidating to those not comfortable with gritty downtown areas. HOWEVER, immediately east and north are more bustling, visitor-oriented, commercial, and theater areas -- which feel busy and safe. Police patrols seemed common, too. The location shouldn't scare you unless you are the very most faint-of-heart who really feels more comfortable in mega-hotels and mall settings.
