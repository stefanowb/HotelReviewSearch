A steal considering it's P-town. The hotel is a little far to the center, but you would pay a lot more to stay in just a bedroom at a guesthouse in the center. The furnishings are a little dated but okay, though flat screen TVs would be nice. The wifi worked well for my companion, though I had difficulty. I am not sure why. I have to say how nice, friendly, and helpful the staff was.

Without prompting, the staff upgraded our room, and allowed us to check-in early, and check out a bit late. While this is likely due to the slow winter season, it was much appreciated. The room was great, and the location was good. Provincetown, while fun in the summer, is also beautiful in the winter.
