Dinner can be traded in at lunchtime as long as you keep within 15 Euros per adult and half of that per child which is good if you decided to venture to local surrounds and try a meal out which we did twice. We did some homework before we left home and chatted to new friends made on holiday to avoid bad restaurants.
