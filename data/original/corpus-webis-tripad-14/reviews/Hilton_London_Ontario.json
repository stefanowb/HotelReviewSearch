Staff is friendly and efficient. Room is spacious and clean. WIFI Internet connection is fast (charge applicable). However, as it is an older property (that has been updated). Certain things cannot be changed. For example, you can only choose \"high or low\" for air-conditioning, no specfiic temperature control. Shower tiles are little old. TVs are not flat-screens. Small complaints, but understandably as it's not a big city. Also tried their casual restaurant, London Grill. Decent lunch buffet. $10 for roast beef lunch (also chicken entree if you are not into beef). The only gripe I have is that the desserts should be encased because there were fruit flies circling around. By the way, their gym is under renovation for next 3 weeks., but they give courtesy day pass to YMCA across the street, so it's even better.", "title": "Acceptable, even though may not be the typical Hilton standards.", "user": "AKLVancouver_Canada_", "date": "June 28, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 69015298}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed here for 1 night in June for business.

The check-in machine at the front desk worked once. Last year, I always got chocolates as an evening amenity but that has disappeared for the last little while.

When the guy from the desk came up to help with A/C, he used the word \"hideous\" and that it was. I am an ex-smoker and the worst kind of anti-smoking advocate, but this was her first time traveling to a conference like this and I was disappointed for her. The beds were the best part. I had a great night's sleep. Not a lot of noise. Ate in restaurant here once and it was average but had a great British server who was quite delightful.

After reading some of the other reviews posted, I was a bit nervous about staying here but I am happy to report that my stay was very good. Upon check-in I found I had been upgraded to the executive floor. My room was spacious and comfortable with just a few minor complaints. The bed was up on a platform and I had to jump up to get on it. I measured it and it was over 3 feet off the ground -- about a foot higher than the average bed. The desk was large and the dresser was also very oversized and tall. The TV was old, but it worked well. The bathroom was clean and everything worked well, but the sink was very low off the ground -- in direct contrast to the bed. Perhaps the workmen who installed the bed were tall and those working on the bathroom were short! In any case, even I found I was stooping over the sink and I am only 5'4\" tall. Just outside the bathroom there was another sink and mirror -- also at the same low level. There was only one phone in the room and it was beside the bed. This is the first hotel I have stayed in that did not have a phone on the desk. I commented on it to the room service delivery-person and they said there should be a phone on the desk. I called downstairs to ask, and they said it must have been broken and they would see if they could bring another one.
