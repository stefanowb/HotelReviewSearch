The heat cranks like crazy which is cool because it is so cold outside. The room has a brand new flat screen TV, huge comfy king bed and clean room and bathroom. They also have free wifi which is a huge plus and it works great. The pool area is really nice with a hot tub. Some of the rooms in the pool area have a balcony. Even though we are close to the pool it is still very quiet and we cant hear a thing from inside our room. The staff is really very nice even though I only had limited interaction with them. The cleaning staff came and we were still sleeping because we were up late and we said we didn't need the room cleaned but they gave us a ton of towesl without even asking. The hotel set up a huge area for the club to set up and display bikes and stuff like that. They also had a huge room where we had the dinner and awards banquet. The food that was served was good and the service were pretty prompt considering there were a ton of people there. We saw some of the rooms that our friends were staying in and they were just as equally as nice as ours and just as clean.
