I even called and confirmed with the hotel a week in advance. What was so special, I wanted TWO beds with a river view. We were traveling with our daughters age 12 and 14, and have had problems in the past booking online with expedia and other websites when we arrived at the hotel. So, I assumed booking through the hotel would remedy the problem (we all know, one should never assume), it did not. We arrived to a lovely hotel with very friendly valet staff, and that is where it ends. At check-in I was told they had our room ready, great considering it was 12:00, could I just give them a credit card and sign on the dotted line. What a KING??? No I booked a room with TWO beds! Sorry we only have this room and would be happy to give you a roll-away at no extra charge! Needless to say I was not pleased, The manager came, no apology, nothing. After a stand-off and my voice growing louder, he asked us to take a sit and would go and speak to yet another manager (the one that can make a decision), 25 minutes later a room was found. Of course the room was not ready and we were assurred we would be called once it was. Guess what, no call so at 5:00 we returned to be told yes the room was ready and again no apology for not calling to let us know. I admit the room was lovely inside, however I would not recommend the river view, its not worth the extra money. The courtyard is a joke and is closed a lot of the time for weddings, etc. If you go to the bar make sure they charge you the correct amount. My husband and I had a bottle of wine out on the terrace one night and were charged $20.00 over the price listed. Guess what it happened twice! The location is OK and not in the heart of the riverwalk, but close enough to enjoy.

Only one problem, and it's a big one. We left one night early because it was sooooo incredibly loud, and I've never been one to do that, I usually just grin and bear it. I had seen reviews that said the same thing but thought \"I'm young and going to party a bit, surely I won't be bothered by it...\" I was wrong. I slept about one hour total and that was after three strong magaritas!!! We stayed on the downtown side of the hotel on the 3rd floor. There is a bar on the street level next door that blared their music out of speakers on the street ( can't understand how they can do that, but they do) After about 3am that went away, Then the buses started running and I heard a bus stop and start loudly right in front of the hotel every 3-5 minutes. Every car that drives down the street is heard easily and it is on a major throughfare. I'm really not exagerating here, I wish I was. It's possible that you might do better off staying on the river side but I can't imagine that this place has a bit of soundproofing, so that might not be any better. I was very disappointed because the rest of the hotel is absolutely to die for. I loved the decor and the restaraunt was good. Customer service was great.

We arrived at 1pm (check-in is not until 4) and they happily accommodated us by getting us a beautiful king bedroom. The hotel atmosphere is gorgeous. Beautiful water features, lighting, etc. The room was clean, cozy and very chic. Great bathroom amenities, filled mini bar, flat screen tv...everything you would expect of a hotel of this class. Upon our return from lunch, I found a hand signed birthday card from the whole staff in my room as well as cheesecake with strawberries as a birthday treat! I could go on and on, but for anyone looking for an exquisite hotel room, excellent customer service, and ideal location on the Riverwalk you MUST book a room here. I'm not typically one to do reviews, but this type of service deserves proper acknowledgment. Thank you for making my birthday so special Hotel Valencia!

Because of an event in the hotel\u2019s neighborhood, where some of the streets were closed off to traffic, it was difficult to find the entrance for valet parking. After calling the front desk, though, they helped us get there. I had stayed at the Valencia before, and knew that the location was just what I wanted. On the Riverwalk, close enough to the event I visited San Antonio for that weekend (International Accordion Festival at LaVillita), but far enough not to be right in the middle of all the action. It\u2019s a pleasant walking distance and very pleasant walk. I opted for a city view room (king bed) because I knew I would be spending most of my day at the Riverwalk anyways, so there was no need to have a view of it after dark. The room was a very good size, window facing the courtyard (but unfortunately also the opposite wall). I liked the look of the dark wood shutters, but not the fact that they could not be opened all the way. The room was already very dark, and a little more light would have been welcome. I like the modern interior styling of the rooms very much. Lovely dark wood floors. I appreciated that they had not flowered bedspread (yeah!!). The bed was very comfortable. There was an entry way into the main room, after the room door, which is a nice feature; it gives you enough privacy in case a hotel employee enters. The long desk along the wall is very functional; it also is large enough to store other items. I never was able to get the TV to work, but didn\u2019t really need to because I was out and about mostly (just wanted to check for weather report). Nice style; good location; fair value. Too dark in the rooms though. Hard to read. The front desk let us check out at noon, even though check out time is 11:00. There is no self-parking available at the hotel, which I don\u2019t like. There are parking opportunities in the neighborhood, but not really very much cheaper, so I opted for the valet. It took much longer than promised to get the car from the valet. In all fairness I must add it was raining that morning, which is kind of unusual, and which may have made it take longer for the valets to retrieve the cars. Personnel is very friendly.

Room appeared clean. Staff was great. Hotel dark and depressing ...room dark & depressing....made entire trip very sad. Hated to go back to the hotel at the end of the day - but used Hotwire so had prepaid. Just incredible that the whole place was soooooo gloomy... Lobby dark, room dark, restaurant dark..... Not sure what management was thinking with the lack of lighting, but they might want to rethink. Valet parking was outrageous at $29 per day.... around corner was $9 per day in public garage. Definitely think about it very hard before you book here...life is too short.", "title": "gloomy and sad", "user": "civicgyrl", "date": "October 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118941639}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I had business in San Antonio - so I stayed a couple of extra days, and brought my husband down for the weekend.
