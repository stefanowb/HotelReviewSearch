Anyway I could still have a drink on the terrace and watch Florence disappear into a purplish haze. The Pensione is a charming and eccentric establishment replete with charming an eccentric guests. Even the cranky breakfast staff somehow made you smile. But the place does need a little money spent on it.

The decor is perfect, the food is authentic and delicious and all of the staff were attentive and accomodating with any requests we had. The rooms were all unique and had varying features. Wi-Fi was available but the signal wasn't always easy to find/keep. The rooms were clean and spacious. The bed was a little on the 'firm' side for my tastes and was low to the ground and moved easily on the wood floor, but it did not hamper the enjoyment of my stay. This is not a chain type hotel and you will not find a flat screen TV, mini bar or coffee maker in your room. It is quiet, rural, and absolutely charming. Aside from day trips into Florence, the lovely Etruscan town of Fiesole is just up the road and worth going to see. There's a small market there on Saturday mornings, as well as an interesting archeological museum and church.
