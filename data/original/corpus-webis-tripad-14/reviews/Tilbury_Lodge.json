Tilbury Lodge is on a quiet, really pretty little street but downtown is easily reachable by bus. Our room was really comfortable but not fancy -- what put this B&B over the top for us was the little touches everywhere. Fruit baskets, candies, muffins and even fudge in the room. Our afternoon teacups were already set up with a biscuit on the side, these little details were just perfect. Stefan, the owner, even let us keep our car there after we had checked out so we could meet a friend in Oxford. Very nice cooked breakfast, we had the vegetarian version with veggie sausages, and someone even made sure the muffins in our room were veg.
