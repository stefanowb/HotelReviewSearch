It was clean and well furnished. The bathroom has been updated fairly recently and had nice tile and a big sink vanity where my teenaged daughter and I could both do our makeup at the same time. The murphy bed was nice, we weren't there much during the day so left if down the whole time. The sofa is NOT a sofa sleeper like we thought so our kids had to share the murphy bed. A problem big sister solved by creating a barrier of pillows so little brother wouldn't (yuck) touch her during the night. The kitchen was well stocked, we didn't eat in much, but it was still nice. The fridge is full sized and there's an oven, stove, microwave, toaster.

It was awfully hot in the bedroom and I wanted to trade beds with the kids but they wouldn't hear of it. The air conditioner blew right on the murphy bed but my son thought it was too cold so he'd turn it off whenever we turned it on, so the rest of us were always hot. It does help to have a fan blowing on you at night. If you open the windows just be prepared for the sweet sound of the birds at the crack of dawn. Sweet is pushing it, I like birds but there were some really noisy ones! If you want to sleep in, close all the drapes (I used a hair clip to hold them closed), and pull them up off the front of the A/C and turn in on. There are wonderful trees on the grounds, the plumeria trees smelled heavenly. The laundry room is right across from 127, but it closes at 9pm so the noise wasn't a problem. There's a restroom right there too, so if someone is taking too long showering, you can run over there and use the bathroom (from 9am - 9 pm). The pool is close and handy. It's nice to put in a load of dirty beach towels, and hang out at the pool while they wash.

We left ours on the lanai, so maybe they'll still be there if you want to use them. There are beach towels too, but we brought our own because we snorkel a lot and didn't want to take anyone else's towels out with us. The snorkeling was GREAT by the way. Try Ahihi Cove or 5 Graves to see a lot of turtles. We could actually hear the humpback whales singing! It's a little hard getting in and out of the water at them, but awesome snorkeling.
