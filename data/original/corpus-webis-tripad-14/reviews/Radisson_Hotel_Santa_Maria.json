Our AAA advisor suggested staying @ the Radisson because of its location near the airport. We had a very relaxing and wonderful stay. The room was very clean and comfortable. The dining room was spacious and welcoming, but at the same time we could get a booth for just the two of us for an intimate dinner. Food was to die for! While my husband had a steak, I had a pasta dish! YUM! The next morning before our flight out, we had a wonderful breakfast served by a very friendly server. I would definetly recommend this to my friends.", "user": "Lucille1956", "date": "July 18, 2007", "id": 8182139}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Eh, not so great", "text": "I have stayed at many Radisson hotels both in the United States and in Europe.

We booked a room last minute because we couldn't find another room elsewhere and wanted to try out the sleep number beds. When we got there we had our choice of a few rooms and we asked for whatever was going to be the most quiet. What a joke. We were put in a room on the third floor and at about 9pm started hearing loud music. When we called the front desk they informed us that there was a club on the bottom floor and they couldn't tell us what time the music would stop. We decided to switch rooms and were put on the other side of the hotel. We thought this would be quieter and were surprised to look out of the window and literally be on an airport runway. We were within hundreds of feet of small airplanes taking off. They did not stop until late at night and began very early in the morning. The hotel is actually between the airport building and the runway which we realized the next morning, so you cannot be any closer to the planes. It's ridiculous. And to top it all off, the sleep number beds were not that comfortable and very loud to operate.
