The location is good - convenient for business travelers headed to one of the many nearby offices, and also good for tourists who want a good base from which to check out midtown. The place was packed when I was there. Always lots of people in the lobby. Despite this, service stayed pretty efficient. Our room was cleaned, room service was super quick, we had no problems with check-in or check-out. The restaurant downstairs was super expensive, but at least it was fast. My biggest complaint would be that the room could be cleaned more thoroughly. There were bunches stray hairs here and there, on the desk, on the toilet - that were definitely not mine. The carpet felt like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Other than that, free wifi would have been nice. Also, I was a bit put off by having to pay to have the hotel store my bags for a few hours after check-out. Other than that, this place is what it advertises itself as - about a 4 star.", "title": "It's okay - great location, so-so rooms.
