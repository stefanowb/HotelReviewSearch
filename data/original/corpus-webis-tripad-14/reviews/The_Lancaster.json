He made sure we were taken care of and did a speedy check in process. He also gave us a coupon for a free appetizer at the Aquarium restaurant. He did tell us that there was an 8.95 fee per guest for the \"free\" breakfast buffet that would be charged on our bill. I wasn't too happy with this charge as we did not go to the breakfast bar at all on our 3 day stay. When I asked to have the charged removed I was denied. That is the one problem I had with the service during our stay. Russell also informed us that they were in the middle of a renovation on the hotel and its rooms, but that the movers would only be working during a 10am to 5pm shift. This was false, I was woken up every morning by people moving furniture at 7:30 - 8:00 am. Normally I wouldn't care, but this was a getaway weekend and we wanted to sleep later than normal.
