The staff was fine - pleasant and accommodating enough, although no one went out of their way for us. Three people chose to help one check-in, instead of someone stepping aside to help the person next in line. We made reservations for the Friday evening lobster bake, and it was cancelled without our being notified - we would have made reservations somewhere else, had we known. But I had two big issues, and they were with maintenance - in many many spots, the white railings were full of rust and badly needed a coat of paint, I can't believe management doesn't see this. It cheapens the place considerably. Here I am, swimming in the gorgeous infinity pool, only to look up and see this view that looks like it belongs in the Projects. Also, there was evidence of bugs everywhere, cobwebs on my balcony, dead bugs on windowsills, even the windowsill in the dining area. Not appetizing. These are not difficult to fix issues and it stymies me that it's allowed to continue. On the plus side, the spa is among the best I've ever visited and I recommend it wholeheartedly. But there was vacancy in mid July in this upscale sea resort town, that should tell you something.", "title": "Nature Did Her Part, Cliff House Not So Much", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "PaulaRuth", "date": "July 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 168680603}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I peeked at prior reviews, many other areas were listed as \"more romantic\" but i loked the view and the history here so off we went!

Although it really isn't a resort that caters to children, we chose it for the location (short ride to beach and shops) and the indoor and outdoor family pools as well as the convenience of not having to leave the facility for meals. It suited our purpose perfectly. The food was good; the evenings entertainment in the lounge was a treat for all of us, especially the children who love to dance. Being the week after the 4th, it was not crowded. We had a lovely time...the children went home and Grandma stayed an extra two days...enjoying the spa and a little quiet time. A few recommendations I would make are #1. We are repeat customers - upon check-in we (or anyone else in this situation) should be greeted as such \"Mr or Mrs Clifford, so nice to have you back with us\". #2 Valet service to help with luggage would be a huge plus. #3 Bathroom facilities at the outdoor family pool would be greatly appreciated as well. Overall our experiences have been quite enjoyable and we will continue going back. Love, love the spa. Wouldn't it be wonderful if somehow the ownership would keep the spa and spa building open though the winter months...offer a continental breakfast, a wine bar afternoons and evenings and, of course, spa treatments/packages.
