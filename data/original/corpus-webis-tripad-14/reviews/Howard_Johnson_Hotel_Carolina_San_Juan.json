We were disappointed as soon as we checked in and saw our room. It was on the lobby floor which may not have been terrible except for the fact that the room was tiny, you could hear everything that was happening outside of the room and worst of all, there were no windows! It was a dark little dungeon. But for the fact that we were only staying 3 nights, I was very close to walking down the street and finding something else. We did ask to change rooms but the staff stated that everything was booked. The staff, by the way, could have been a bit more customer service oriented. They seemed to have attitudes and were not receptive to questions. The service in the hotel restaurant was terrible. The waitstaff were friendly but the service was beyond slow. They don't acknowledge you when you walk in, you have to just guess that you should pick any seat available. The tables were still dirty from prior customers and on one occasion, we waited approx. 30 minutes before anyone even came over to take our order. It was so bad that we complained to the restaurant manager and we weren't the only ones complaining. On the good side, the pool was nice and the beach is conveniently right across the street. The hotel is nicely situated on a relatively busy strip but having visited Old San Juan, I would have rather stayed nearer to there because they seemed to have a much wider and nicer selection of restaurants than where we were and our location seemed better suited for spring breakers. The bus stop to Old San Juan is across the street from the hotel and is approx. 45 mins, it costs about 50 cents. El Yunque is a must see and I would recommend renting a car a driving there as it's a relatively easy drive and was much cheaper than a tour.

Dont understand the complaints about the continental breakfast. You get what you pay for. Included in your stay - Coffee and danish or croissant each morning, or 2.50 toward your breakfast. Restaurant service is slow, yes, but so is everything else in the carribean. We got ours to go, and we were off. Happy hour daily from 6-10pm---3.00 drinks excluding Chevis and Johnnie Walker.

Will not recomend to walk too late at night there is a Irish pub / niteclub that plays hip hop that is not considered safe by the locals even though it is always full and has long lines to get in so it is better to drive, park inside the nicer hotels. DO not do valet the casinos would not over it.
