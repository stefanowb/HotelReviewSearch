We even did the steak fry safari, which was great for the kids, although the previous day we had already gone to the wilderness area, and got roped into the animal tour for $30 per person. Yes, $30 even for kids. And the steak fry dinner was about $150 for my family of four, and you had to pay extra for soda. I mean, c'mon. Not to mention a less than 10 minute pony ride for each of my kids that ended up being $50 with tip. Or the rock climbing wall which was over $20 per person, or the mini golf..... EVERYTHING is extra. I could go on and on. Its too bad, because the resort is beautiful, and the staff is absolutely wonderful, and very welcoming.

No chef's salads, tuna or chicken salads or a decent hamburger (the ones we got on that awful ciabatta roll were dreadful). Then we had dinner at the restaurant at Mystic Rock. Other than running out of the specials, not having the vodka we drank, and the unbelievibly slow service, we suffered through another extremely poor meal. We couldn't send the steaks back as we had been there over an hour just getting our salads.
