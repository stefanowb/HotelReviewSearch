The major downside to this hotel is that if your stay includes a Saturday or Sunday, the kitchen is closed and you can not eat here.

The hotel is very nice and despite being on a busy road has good sound insulation. However you really do run the risk of being bumped. Just like another reviewer on this site I booked a two night stay over a month in advance abd was told, on arrival, that there were no room for me at the inn (a similar excuse of clients being ill etc). They put us in the napoleon for one night. The napoleon was ok but not up the Radisson's standards. Anyway our w/e was very much inconvenienced and I insisted on a discount, which I got and made up for it, at least to some extent - but I would have preferred to pay full rate and stay at the radisson.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 27, 2005", "id": 4065577}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2004", "text": "A tip.

Although we arrived well into the evening and had booked for dinner, the champagne and a bath in the divine bathroom seduced us first! Our request for a later table was happily accommodated. The staff at this hotel are amazing - all those we met were French and tolerated my attempts to practice their language, but spoke impeccable English when necessary. They were all friendly and helpful. Our dinner was lovely but although I'd told them in advance I'm a vegetarian, I was given the almost inevitable omelette! This was disappointing. I know the hotel's in Paris, but a quiche or something similar shouldn't have presented a challenge to a good chef!
