First the only plus, you cannot go wrong with the location. It is across the Saint Paul's cathedral, next to London's main tourist information booth, 2 minutes from tube and 5 minutes from the Museum of London and surrounded by some of the best restaurants. 5 minutes walk to the millennium bridge with view of the Thames. We got a pretty decent and spacious room but when you pay $420/night, this is the least you expect. Now the many negatives: We stayed for six days (which is a fairly long stay to judge the quality of a hotel); we got breakfast only first two days and after that there was no breakfast. When I asked the manager he said (grumpily), \"That was part of the booking.\" I said, I had booked on their website and the website did not make any mention of only two days of breakfast. I was with my 11 year old and they said, \"OK, he can eat whatever he wants to but you can only eat continental.\" Also, the pool is unavailable to children except for a few hours on weekdays (why???). The staff was fairly friendly. No early check-in and they charged $100 for a local telephone call. When I complained they said that since I had dialed the country code, the phone read it as a national call. I told them that I had called someone living in London and the number was local, the removed only part of the charge. I still had to pay $50 for a local phone call!

When I made my reservation on Lastminute.com, I made a request to the hotel that, as it was a special occasion, could we have a room looking at St. Pauls Cathedral. We were not dissapointed. On opening the curtains in the room on our arrival, there was the magnificent St.Pauls right in front of us. The only problem though, was that we couldn't have the curtains open, because our room was on a corner and everyone in the offices oiutside could see straight into the room. Our room was spacious with a very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom. Other than that, the hotel is very modern and spotless, but you should expect that from a 5*. We didn't try the health club or the restaurant so cannot comment on that. We did try to have a drink at the bar on our return to the hotel at midnight but the bar was packed with workers all showing off trying to see who could spend the most money. It was so noisy and I can imagine the atmosphere getting aggressive at times looking at some of the drunks there. Might be wrong. We decided to take our drinks to our room. The bar was not the place to have a relaxing drink. Staff at reception seemed a bit robotic and weren't too friendly but check in/ check out was fast.
