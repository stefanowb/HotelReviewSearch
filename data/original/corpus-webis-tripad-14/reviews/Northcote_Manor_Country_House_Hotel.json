There was a constant humming noise and every couple of minutes it sounded as if a spin drier was operating. We put this down to the usual daily workings of a hotel. However on returning to the room after dinner the noise still persisted. We did call reception who sent someone up. He thought it may be the fan in the downstairs toilets so said he would turn it off. He did not return to see if the noise had gone. It clearly wasn't this but by this time it was too late to start packing and moving rooms. Therefore had an awful nights sleep with both the noise and heat. In hindsight we should have moved rooms but after a long journey and a few glasses of wine with dinner thought sleep would come easily. We did complain on checkout and the manager was very apologetic. He said the room was above the boiler and he would look into it.

Most of the staff were extremely helpful. The food, whilst good, was certainly not what I would describe as gourmet, it lacked depth of flavour and there was very little evidence of seasoning, certainly not worth the full price of \u00a380 if you paid it. The wines which accompanied the courses were not good quality and Cotes de Ventoux is not a Northern French wine! We lived in France for 18 months and have eaten much better for much less. Rooms (suite) very good, bed extremely comfortable, jacuzzi bath a real treat.

What a fantastic place, from the moment you arrive, you are met by courteous, polite staff. The food was tremendous. I am quite a fussy eater, but the chef prepared a alternative menu for me, which was excellent, my husband enjoyed the normal menu, he said the steak was the best he has ever had and the wine that was served with three of the six courses, really complimented the food. Breakfast, too was wonderful, the quality of food is excellent as was the service. We had a turndown service, whilst we were at dinner, fruit and shortbread in the room.
