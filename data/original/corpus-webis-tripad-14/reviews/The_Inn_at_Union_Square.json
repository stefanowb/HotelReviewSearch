The noise from staff setting up the breakfast each morning distrubed our sleep. We were woke up at 6:45 a.m. to the sounds of clanging dishes and other usual kitchen noises.

The late evening cookies and tea were a nice touch before we went to bed after dinner on the town. The morning breakfast of pastries, croissants, yogurts and various breads to toast was filling.

The hotel location right on Union Square cannot be beat -you have plenty of nearby shops, for when you may have forgotten something, or just want to splurge in the fancier Union Square stores like Macy's. There are also plenty of restaurants, from little independent coffee shops, sandwich stores, to beautiful restaurants, Michael Mina and Postrio. Try Scala on Powell - moderately priced Italian, but very busy. We have stayed in the two-room suites, which for their price are very reasonable. The separate sitting-room is nice as one of us could stay up if the other wanted to rest. We travelled with our toddler whom we could put to bed early in the back bedroom. The room amenities are nice, but not overly done - nice marble and tile baths, not Four Seasons, but you're not paying for the Four Seasons either. The Inn offers a nice continental breakfast, which includes cold cereals, pastries, bagels, etc, and complimentary wine in the evening, white or red, and some cheese and crackers. This was a nice touch after walking around all day, and then you could head off to whatever restaurant you wanted.
