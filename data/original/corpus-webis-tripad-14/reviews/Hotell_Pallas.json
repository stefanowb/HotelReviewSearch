The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. The rooms were ok, typical European hotel rooms. Our room had a sketch drawing on the wall which added to the room's decor. The bathroom was sparse as are the amenities in the room. Basically, its just a bed, tv, dresser/wardrobe. The included breakfast buffet was served in a British themed pub located in the same building as the hotel (the hotel has a couple of the top floors in a commercial building). The buffet's selection was sparse. All in all though, this hotel has an ok value for someone that needs to stay for the nigh enroute. I wouldn't recommend it for an overnight stay or people looking for a romantic getaway.", "title": "Nice Hotel, Well Staffed and Good Location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "capturedplanet", "date": "September 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8720920}], "location": {"country": "Estonia", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Tartu"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 15, "very good": 19, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 15}, "aka": "Hotell Pallas Tartu", "slim_ranking": 0.157894736842}
