The breakfasts were buffet style and included pastries, scrambled egg, bacon (a bit oily but edible), cereals, cold meats and yoghurts. The open top bus tours had a stop on the Via Veneto at the end of our road, which was very convenient. We also found the stroll to the Trevi fountain and Spanish Steps in the evenings great for choosing places to eat. One night there was free open air opera singing at the steps - magical. Our room was of a decent size for the three of us and clean. The shower was a bit quirky but functional and the bathroom generally was good with ample room and included a bidet. The heat outside was a crushing 37 degrees but the airconditioning just about coped. The laundry service was reasonable for Rome and prompt.
