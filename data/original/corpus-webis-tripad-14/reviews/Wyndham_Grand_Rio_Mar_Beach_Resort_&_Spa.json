Overall a very nice resort. Staff is friendly and accomodating and they always greet you with a smile. Service at the beach bar a little slow during peak times. Food very good but overpriced. For a good meal, take the cab ($20.00 round trip) to Don Pepe. Some days it was hard to find a lounger by the pool as many people have reserved with towels early. Nice long, not crowded beach. Walk the beach to the right of the ocean and there is a private, uninhabited area with a lagoon of water with rainforest in background. Just beautiful. Beach was closed for three days while we were there (high tidal waves) but on the days it was open, it was great for finding shells - especially sand dollars (found at least a dozen of those). We stayed in East wing, kind of a far walk to the ball rooms but good exercise. Housekeeping is good. Front desk is responsive to needs. Only disappointment was that we requested a king size bed and had two doubles. Not too romantic! The hotel was booked and they don't have many king rooms, so they weren't able to switch us. Iguan feeding at 11am daily is cool. Food is good, nice variety but very expensive. We recommend you take a cab to an authentic PR restaurant. Great pina coladas and other frozen drinks at Rio Mar, but priced at $10-12 each.", "title": "Very nice resort", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "susiedoozy", "date": "April 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15112712, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beach wasn't crowded", "disliked": "\u2014 Beach closed for three days"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "After staying at the Copamarina and the El San Juan, this hotel had quite a different feel--all three did in fact.

We stayed here a few years ago. The hotel is nicely situated and has lovely grounds. Very relaxed atmosphere and generally staff were pleasant and motivated to please.The large stretch of beach, this property fronts is lovely. The water was clean and inviting. Yes, I do agree with some of the negatives regarding the limited, expensive food choices, but we made the best of it. We remembered this issue from our prior stay,but we wanted to give it another try-hoping for some inprovement. I must note that we stayed our last two nights at The Ritz Carlton, near Old San Juan area.Surprisingly, we preferred the Westin due to what we valued as important for our vacation stay. We liked the idea of being away from the city-more importantly-the airport.(the sound of airplanes/smell of fuel was disturbing) It was nice to just relax and not feel that we had to leave the property to dine. Some dinners were dissapppointing-but some were very good and enjoyable-despite the expense. We have stayed at other resorts where the meals were at least equal or more costly so we were not shocked. If you truly like to be out and about and have access to the nightlfe of Old San Juan area, then yes staying here might not be the best choice. But if you are looking for a relaxing beach resort experience without the need to have something to do every night then this might be what you are looking for. We did do a one day shopping/lunch in Old San Juan-which was enough for us.Some more adventurous people visit the Rain Forest nearby. The Casino is small(in comparision to the one at The Ritz) but adequate. They have a David's Cookies that has ice cream, cookies, desserts, and coffee. In the morning you can get coffee/ muffin for low cost breakfast. We mostly ate at the bar area which had a very nice delux continental breakfast for $15.00 including tax/gratuities. Thought this was a great deal and very good. Dinner at their main dinning room, Meres was very good. Lunch at Coqui was good-but do avoid dinner there. We ate twice at the Italian restaurant-Palio-which was very good. Service tends to be slower than what you would expect or hope for, but found that to be the tendency. I do have to say, though that the pleasant and accommodating staff made up for the slow service at times. We enjoyed our stay at the Westin and would return.

I cannot say enough good things about the staff. They pre-arranged restaurant reservations, babysitting, and spa services for me and throughout my stay were incredibly diligent and thorough. That said, the rooms were average, and I was highly disappointed to find that the \"partial ocean view\" that I booked required me to go out onto my balcony to actually see the ocean.

The first room I was given was at the back overlooking an ugly roof with loud noise from the air conditioning system. I asked for a move which was arranged after asking three times and was given a room with partial sea view. The air conditioning only blew ice cold air keeping the room at about 62 degrees so I had to turn it off as despite my complaining nothing was done. It was so cold at first that when I opened the door to the balcony the whole room was enveloped in condensation. The other problem was the lack of sound proofing between rooms, and I was kept awake one night until 2 am by next door's TV.

We saved up and had our one big splurge on a round of golf at the Ocean Course (there is also a River Course, but there was a tournament going on when we were there). First of all, there is only one par 3 hole that is on the ocean - and it's surrounded by construction as they are building new condos all around it. The other 17 holes are no where near the ocean. And they didn't even tell us that they were seeding all of the greens, so we paid $150 per person for \"green\" fees even though the greens were perfectly brown and sandy with seed. It was very disappointing. Though the course may have been special back in the '80s when Greg Norman designed it, it is very run down and is not worth such a high green fee.", "title": "Beautiful pool area, but serious drawbacks", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lmhendrix", "date": "July 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8039979, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 nice beach", "disliked": "\u2014 golf"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "In conclusion, if you want to lay by a nice pool and be on a nice beach, you will enjoy this hotel, but for anything besides that, I highly recommend that you rent a car and go explore the \"real\" Puerto Rico outside of the hotel compound.", "title": "Loved the resort, but the prices were high", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "devon0322", "date": "June 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8030002}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the resort June 18-22, just my husband and I, and we really had a great time!

The restaurants, bars and spa on site are pricey, but you can save lots of money on the tours by renting a car! The rainforest (El Yunique) is a free tour but the hotel charges $38 per person to take you there. El Yunique is directely up the \"long mountain road\" from the hotel. The hotel also offers a tour to Old San Juan which is $45 per person but they dont take you to the El Morro fort, it only goes to the forts by the shopping area. If you rent a car you can go throughout the entire tourist area and just pay for parking (much cheaper). Also, there's a great outlet mall about 20 minutes away from the hotel. The conceirge is very helpful with maps and directions so if you decide to rent a car - getting around shouldnt be a problem. I suggest you rent from the Avis car rental located at the resort because they'll give you free parking, otherwise parking is $15 a day for outside rentals. Also there's 2 really good spanish restaurants at the corner of highway #3 where the resort entrance is (Don Pepe & Antoniette's) their prices are way cheaper than anything in the resort. Also there's KFC's, Burger King's and other fast food places you can get to (if you have a car).Be sure to keep all your receipts charged to your room and review your bill before paying room charges. If your traveling with kids - the hotel feeds the iguanna's at 11am everyday for free - join in! The kids club is a bit a rip off, unless u really need a babysitter.

We were there with our two children 4 & 9 and the room was fine for all of us. Now the downside All of the on-site restaurants are priced out of site for dinner and none better then Outback. We went to all of them Palio, The Grille Room, Aqua Luna. Our average dinner bill with one bottle of wine was over $250.00 every night. Please keep in mind the kids are eating a hot dog or macaroni and cheese. I read some of the reviews before I started to write this and some of the reviewers state that the hotel is \"Only\" 45 minutes from the Airport or Old San Juan. Well, to me that is a pretty long drive. Since the hotel is in the middle of nowhere you pretty much feel like a prisoner of the resort. If it rains while you are down there or if you need a break from the pool, boy are you in trouble. To break up our trip we decided to take a cab ride to Old San Juan..$180.00 round trip. Would have rented a car for the day but the Avis on site had no cars available. All in all there are plenty of places you can spend $4,000 to $5,000 for a weeks vacation and it is my opinion this is not the place. Oh getting back to my above mentioned staffing issues. You could never find a waiter around the pool area and on top of that each restaurant was closed at least 2 nights while we were down there because they did not have the proper staffing levels. I know I may sound a little tough on this place but don't only take my opinion we ended up meeting about 7 couples while we were down there and they all had the same opinion except for the family that golfed.

Frozen drinks are $10, but you can get the local Medalla beer for $4. Dinners range from $14 to $50. You can do it pretty cheap if you wanted to. Rent a car for the day, go to the grocery and stock up on snacks, sandwiches, water and liqour. Save your money for dinner. For breakfast you can go to the coffee shop for $4 ham and cheese croissants. For lunch grab a foot long hot dog for $7. For dinner you can sit at the Bistro bar and have a pizza for $14. Depending on how adventerous you are, a rental car would be advisable, but not necessary. We only rented a car one day and went to the rain forest and Old San Juan. We were content the rest of the time just hanging out at the beach and relaxing. The iguanas add entertainment. Word of warning, the casino closed the day we left.

June 29th through July 8. We stayed at 3 different hotels so we could explore the whole island and ALL 3 hotels were great because of using trip advisor. ALWAYS use trip advisor even if hotels.com gives it 5 star. My sister, friends and I stayed at Lazy Parrot, Wyndhem Rio Mar Resort (formerly the westin rio mar) and Coral Princess. We stayed at this hotel for one night since we want to go to the rainforest and do some things on the east side of Puerto Rico. We got a nice room for $129 a night since we are an \"Entertainment\" member. Its a book called The Entertainment Book with coupons for hotels and car rentals. We could have gotten a suite for the same price but they were all booked (july 4th). Alot of the reviews said that place is secluded. They made it seem it was in the middle of nowhere. Its off the busy highway and there are some restuarants that are 5 minutes away. Though you do have to travel up a road where there are nothing but trees and some houses but there are so much to do at Rio Mar, you really wouldn't want to leave anyway. There are shops that sell name brand stuff like clothes, jeans swimsuits, Guess purses. There was a casino but its being remodeled and will open up in Oct 2007. I peeked inside and its gonna be nice. There is a game room/arcade for the kids that stays opened either all night or til 2am. The rooms you gotta know are excellent. Absolutely great and the BEACH.....we didn't want to leave. In puerto rico the sun is up at 5:30am. The water was so calm and BLUE!!!!!! This was the first hotel I've been to where the internet pix was an exact replica of how the hotel really was. That resort looked so FAKE! Everything was so BEAUTIFUL and green and blue...we were impressed. You will think that my pictures were from the hotels website. The food is pricey. I only had breakfast there. They have this card in the room where they will bring breakfast to your room. You just circle what you want and what time you want it. I don't recommend doing this because, they charge for delivery and plus these taxes and stuff. I almost did it but I went to the restuarant downtairs and it was the same food and a dollar or two cheaper. Breakfast, I had 2 eggs, toast, sausage and orange juice and my total was about $15.

I was part of a larger group. It was my husband's family reunion. There were 23 of us in total including children, two of which were under 2 years old. We all rented three of the 3-bedroom golf villas. I read many of the reviews on this site and because I got to see three different villas I do understand why there are different opinions. Of the three villas our group rented, one was fabulous (luckily, this was the one I was in), one was very nice, and one was not nice. I understand that each is owned privately so each is decorated and cared for differently. However, these were not cheap and the one villa was unacceptable for the price we paid. That one was Villa Naranja. It really needs to be nicer. It was practically bare and there were light bulbs without any fixtures. Just bare light bulbs. Not worth the price. However, Villa Chaly and Villa Rio were fantastic. Villa Rio was the best. If you go try to request it. I rented the villas through The Clusters.com. They were great. Totally helpful. Especially Xavier. He's awesome. Ok, now for the resort. It was very nice though we didn't spend a whole lot of time inside the main building. There was a bunch of construction going on past the main building. I guess just past where the ocean villas were. It was unattractive but the only reason we drove by it was because we drove past the main building by accident. You can't see it from the pool or beach as far as I know. Maybe from the Ocean VIllas though. We ate in the casual restaurant one night and were pleased. But I have to say I don't think Puerto Rican food is all that great to begin with so I wasn't expecting much. The golf villas are quite a ways away from the resort pool and beach. But each villa had use of a golf cart which made it fine. Especially for the kids. They loved the carts. We even found a free place to park a car (near the playground at the pool). The beach was nice though we spent most of our time at the pool. It was pretty windy most of the time we were there so they wouldn't allow umbrellas on the beach and we needed them for the babies. The food and drinks at the pool are ridiculously expensive. Bring a small cooler and bring your own. So that's it. Would I go back? Only if we did another family reunion there - my husband's family is Puerto Rican. Though this has nothing to do with the resort. I just think there are much nicer places than Puerto Rico.

Eesh! They make it hard not to spend money. The last morning we grabbed breakfast at the bakery/hole-in-the-wall at the entrance road/Route 3 and got a ton of food for under $10. Wish we'd seen it sooner . . . My wife would not have been comfortable journeying into the five-minute drive away part of Rio Grande, though, so I'm not sure what options are there. Bargain eating on site? The casual place at the golf club was good and resembled non-resort prices.
