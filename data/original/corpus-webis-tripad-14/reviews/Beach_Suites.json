The penthouse themselves are outstanding - extremely spacious living areas + huge bedrooms (all with massive ensuites) - the furniture + furnishings are modern/trendy + in excellent condition. The rooftop entertaining areas with large heated pools are awesome + provide uninterrupted views of Main Beach, Julian Rocks + the Lighthouse. You cant get a better location in Byron Bay either - walk across the road to the park + beach or 2 mins to Beach Hotel or main street with a plethora of bars/cafes/shops.
