Upon arrival at 22 on Friday evening we were told that for our party of 6 they did not have the 3 double-rooms booked (admitting this was their fault and due to over-booking). Instead they arranged a taxi to take us to a more expensive hotel (Meriton Grand Hotel). We had especially chosen the St Olav hotel as it looked so charming and had a good location in old town. Because of this we told them that if we were not pleased with the new hotel we would come back. The new hotel (albeit of a higher standard) was a standard business hotel - looking like any Hilton or Radisson - and also located outside old town. Thus we went back to St Olav. After 45 minutes of waiting/arguing we were finally offered and shown three rooms: 1 economy room, 1 standard and 1 junior suite. We had booked 3 standard rooms but accepted their offer. When we were given the keys however we got 1 standard and 2 economy rooms! About 2 hours after we arrived at the hotel we were finally in our rooms.

Ideal location, only a few minutes walk to the main square. Rooms were very good quality, bright, well furnished (no storage space for clothes however), if rooms were a little small.
