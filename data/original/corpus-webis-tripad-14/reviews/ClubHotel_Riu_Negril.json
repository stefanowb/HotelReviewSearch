You might say 'leave the pool then' but why should I? I'm entitled to be there too. I do lay part blame on the hotel here; there should be some sort of curbing behaviour like this when it starts to become offensive and bordering on disgusting, regardless of being all inclusive or not.

Everything about the hotel was really good, fastest check in ever ,the rooms were cleaned daily and to a very high standard, The food in all the resturants was varied , with a good selection and well cooked and the staff were very friendly. The bar staff were excellent, very friendly and a good laugh and never scared to serve the drinks,the longest i ever waited for a drink was never more than a couple of minutes and usually they'd poured your drink before you'd finished your last , i recommend giving a small tip as we've found over the years it improves the service but it is not required and the service is very good regardless. The entertainment team were very good, always smiling and up for a chat and probably the best dancers i've seen, i must admit i did find at night there was a bit too much dancing but thats just me. Even the reception staff were very friendly which in my experience is a first. The hotel layout is good with accomidation at one end and the bars and disco at the other so you could have it quiet if you want. We found Tony the taxi man outside the front of the hotel very friendly and would recommend him for trips out remember some of the attractions like dunns river falls you don't need a rep with you. Jamaica is a great place with some things i've not seen anywhere else, we did the jungle zip lines which was amazing, rafting down the river which was good, climbing dunns river waterfall which was really good, a boat trip snorkelling and then stopped off at Rick's Cafe to watch the locals diving off the cliffs and if you're up to it you can jump off as well. We went into Negril during the day and night and found the locals to be very friendly but remember to use the same precautions as you would in any unfamiliar place. 7 mile beach is beautiful , the hotel is actually on Bloody Bay which is very nice with trees on the beach for shade,it is next to 7 mile but a taxi isn't expensive or you can call places like Margeritaville and they will pick you up.
