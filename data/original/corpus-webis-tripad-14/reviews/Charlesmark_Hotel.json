The Charlesmark's rooms ARE small and if I had been traveling with my family, this might not have worked. However, for a single traveler, it was great. The rooms were pleasantly decorated. Beds were very comfortable. Shower was tiled slate, has good water pressure/spray, and the room had wall mounted speakers with an additional speaker in the bathroom. The hair dryer was powerful. Another reviewer complained a lot about the TV channels and lack of DVD player for movies. I did not want to spend my free time in the Back Bay of Boston watching TV--there was plenty to do and lots of shopping and dining in easy walking distance. The location was ideal for me. The breakfast was not expansive, but as a light breakfast eater, it suited me fine. Good coffee. The martini bar downstairs was a bit too trendy for my tastes, but there were plenty of other places nearby that were great (I'm more of an Irish pub type of girl).
