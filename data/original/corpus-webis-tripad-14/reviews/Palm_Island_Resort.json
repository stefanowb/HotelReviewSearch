We checked in with Jill, who was also super friendly and helped me out tons over the phone prior to arriving. We were also welcome by the activities director, who was also super! We dealt with Travis a few times, too, and he was great!

I've been to the restaurant on the island before. It's OK, but everything prepared outside tastes better. There are lights on timers over the grill area and places to sit and eat but it was a bit cool so we ate back at the villa.
