Phoned down asking for changes to be made, and they sent someone up for a copy of our confirmation. Promised a call back. None came, and we needed to check out, so went down to reception. 3 people and 25 minutes later corrections got made. No apology, though clearly their glaring error - and no effort to make change expeditiously. The amount was relatively small (less than 100 pounds), and on more than one occasion one of the staff actually made reference to the small amount - not sure why - isn't a mistake a mistake? Disappointing that what would have been a flawless stay (and we stay at Ritz Carltons, Amans, Four Seasons etc) was tarnished at the end - as honestly that was my final impression.
