I chose this B&B because it seemed to offer a nice alternative to the stuffy Victorian decor offered by most of the other places I looked into. We weren't let down. The entire place was modern and exhibited good taste. They played great music too, soft jazz. We stayed in the village view room, but had a chance to see all of the rooms the next morning. Our room was wonderful. It had high ceilings and was everything you could expect from the pictures. I will say that it was significantly larger than the other 3 rooms. I think this was because it was the only room located on the first floor. It also offered a jetted bath tub, which was exceptional.", "title": "Great Place", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "mshday", "date": "June 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3554681}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful lodging", "text": "Breakfast was wonderful as well.

It's easily the most stylish B&B I've ever stayed in, and feels like you're living in the Restoration Hardware catalog. The breakfast was delicious and equally stylish. Each afternoon the hosts set up wine and snacks in a sitting room downstairs. The staff was friendly and professional. Unfortunately I feel that the view of the \"Pacific View\" room is oversold; yes, there is a distant view of the ocean through the one small window, which you'll enjoy on the way to the bathroom, but that's about the only time. I actually think this borders on false advertising. The fireplace did not work, but I'm willing to accept that was a fluke given the very high level of attention paid to the property in general.
