The room we had was on the second floor (watch that heavy suitcase) up a marble staircase. It had its own wonderful roof terrace with a small kitchen where you can cook or, like us, just buy it all in ready made and save yourself the bother. Then sit back and watch the locals on their terraces. There`s a supermarket a stone`s throw away which is open until 9.30. The room was very clean and appeared to have been recently made over; for example, the cupboards and shutters looked new. The air conditioning was efficient and very quiet - it helps to be able to sleep with the window shut if you`re a light sleeper as there`s always the noise of Italian family life going on outside from early til late. It`s a bit of a trek from the dock, especially in the summer heat, but Diana will meet you off the hydrofoil so you won`t get lost. This is very good, reasonably priced accommodation and I would definitely recommend it.", "title": "Good basic clean accommodation", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Teithiwr", "date": "August 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 18739005, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Roof terrace", "disliked": "\u2014 Narrow stairs"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Reasonably priced, really friendly and helpful staff, nice rooms.
