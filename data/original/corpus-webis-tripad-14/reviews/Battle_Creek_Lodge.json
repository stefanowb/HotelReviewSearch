Boy what a mistake. I should have known that something was wrong when the person who booked me in was intoxicated at 1:30 in the afternoon. They don't take credit cards and perfer cash only. There was junk all over the place inside and out as if there was remodeling going on but there wasn't. I wasn't impressed with the looks of the place.

Or if it was then I'd hate to see what the other rooms looked like. When I opened the door to the room I got a smell of old, musty. like the room is not cleaned or at the very least it's not vented very often. The rooms are small. Much smaller than a regular hotel room. It was dark and if one opens the front windows you get the sound of traffic going by as the lodge is off of the highway about 30 feet. The hot tub smelled SO bad of chemicals that no person in my party wanted to get into it. We had gone out and enjoyed the sights in the Hills and returned to try the wine tasting and cheese. That was the first time in my life that I've had wine out of a bag. It was so bad that I couldn't drink it and refused any thing else. Then there was an anoying dog of the intoxicated owner that was barking ALL the time. We stayed there that night and left without looking back as soon as possible the next morning.
