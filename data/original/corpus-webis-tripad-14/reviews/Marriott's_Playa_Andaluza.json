We were extremely disappointed in the beach. The beach was extremely rocky and looked terrible. I did get some great pictures of the sunset coming down over the mountains however. There isn't a restaurant on site (I think they are building it) so we had to go out and eat or cook in our rooms every night. One night the lights even went out but it was fixed in less than an hour. We got a good laugh about it. The rooms were beautiful. We had a 2 bedroom suite and it was extremely nice. The beds were not that comfortable. I think I would have rather stayed on the couch. The king sized bed was 2 twins pushed together. So at one point in the middle of the night, my fiance woke up because he felt the beds coming apart. Overall, I think this hotel was nice very pretty but very average right now. I think it has the opportunity to one day be a great hotel. There's quite a bit of construction so obviously they are trying to make improvements.", "title": "Nice but a little disappointed", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MrsB3212009", "date": "June 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 16940088}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Typical Marriott timeshare set up with 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, kitchen. beautiful Spanish decor, all rooms have balcony overlooking ocean.
