Traveled extensively throughout Latin America, but had never been to Colombia and was a little hesitant given the negative press. What a surprise!!! Really liked the city--parts of it, in the north section of town, reminded me a lot of residential streets in Madrid. Bogota really has lots to offer culturally and socially and it's a shame more tourists don't make it there, especially as the country has made large strides in personal safety.", "title": "Exceptional location, wonderful service", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "islington3164", "date": "August 21, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3793376}], "location": {"country": "Colombia", "continent": "South America"}, "stars": 4.5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 14, "very good": 68, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 238}, "aka": "Sofitel Bogota Victoria Regia Hotel Bogota", "slim_ranking": 0.0146341463415, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Sofitel Bogota Victoria Regia enjoys an upscale location in the north of Bogota.
