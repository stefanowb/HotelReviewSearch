If it would not be for my kid, I would not come back. But if you have children, this hotel is a good choice : it is a 5 stars class hotel which gives you rather good value for money (especially in summer when room rates are 1/3 of regular rates in winter), it is very conveniently located on the beach, next to the water park Wild Wadi (entrance is free for Jumeirah hotels' guests), with a mall inside (Souk Madinat). The buildings and installations are very good. The service is also quite OK. There are all sorts of restaurants located inside the resorts that you surely can find one or more that suit your taste. Personnally I would recommend the Chinese restautant named \"Zheng He\" and the Thai restaurant named \"Pai Thai\".
