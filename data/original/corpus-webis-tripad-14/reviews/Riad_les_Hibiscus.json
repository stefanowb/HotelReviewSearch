There are 8 rooms in Hibiscus, all inwardly facing. Some are unpleasant, dark, and adjacent to the communal sitting, smoking or playing area. You can't close the windows or you'd smother, so its not very relaxing. The hotel had our booking wrong, by room kind and by the number of nights. They were apologetic but there is an air of Inshallah about the place. Breakfast was included and when we were there was served indoors due to a winter of bad weather - nice fresh orange, coffee, pancakes, bread - French style. Rooms are dark, long and thin and not really designed to stay in but its a peaceful respite from the clamour outside and very handy for the souks. There is a VERY small pool, paddling maybe but not big enough to swim. The hamman advertised wasn't running when we were there.
