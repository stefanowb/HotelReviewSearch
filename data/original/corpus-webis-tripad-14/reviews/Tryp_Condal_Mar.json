Yes, the location is slightly out of town, and the area is being developed, but it was a beautiful hotel and is excellent value for money. The staff were very pleasant and spoke english, breakfast was fine for a cold buffet and the rooms were spotless. If you like the minimalistic style and are looking for a modern and clean hotel but don't want the city centre price tag then I highly recommend it.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 6, 2006", "id": 5038725}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "Wow, what a hotel. This is a beautifully designed hotel, where care and attention has been given to the design from the foyer, upwards. The circular design adds to an intriguing room design, but this doesn't mean the rooms are small by any standards. The room had all the mod cons you would want, except only one 1 English language TV channel (CNN), not that it really mattered to me, but it may to others. The breakfast was a feast, with plenty of variety all for 14 euros. The area outside the hotel was a bit strange as it was away from the hustle and bustle of the city, clearly in the old industrial zone of the city. The area was desolate, but was well lit and you always felt safe walking around in the early hours. The journey from the airport took about 35 mins in a taxi and cost in the region of 28 euros, which wasn't too bad. Alternatively you could take the Aerobus (from the Airport) to Placa Catalyuna and walk (5 mins) to Urquinaona on the L4 (yellow line) and then take the metro from there to Selva De Mar; (you can also take the metro to Catalyuna, but this will mean you need to change which means more walking if you have heavy bags). This will take you around 20-25 mins and will save you some money. The journey on the aerobus is only 3.75 euros and a metro journey single costs only 1 euro (so I'm told). It\u2019s cheaper to get a T10 book which will give you 10 single journeys for around \u20ac7, which is what I did. Even though the hotel is not local, you can get into the centre of Barcelona in around 20-30 mins depending where you go. The bonus is that you do get to stay in a great hotel for less than a usual 4 star hotel in the city. The staff was polite and spoke great English and helped make my first time in Barcelona a memorable one.", "title": "Modern Design at the Vincci.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "jazz_puppy", "date": "April 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4986024}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fabulous hotel!!!", "text": "We've just returned form a trip from Barcelona and stayed in the Hotel Vincci Condal Mar.
