The wireless internet worked well, but that's the only nice thing I can say about this place. The room was disgusting. There were used Q-tips behind the bed & under the table. The bathroom had someone else's hair all over the sink. I picked up the alarm clock to set it and a mysterious liquid that was underneath it dripped all over my hand & arm. The pillows reeked of cheap perfume, which made it difficult to sleep. The coffee maker was missing the coffee pot. There were people going in and out of rooms all night & making a lot of noise. The sheets had old stains on them & the room smelled like cat urine. We didn't get a do not disturb sign and the maid woke us up at 9am.

I am originally from Miami and my company is based in the direct area, so staying at this hotel was great as far as location is concerned...next to all the major expressways, close to food, entertainment, etc. Unfortunately, this is the best comment I can make about this hotel. They are still recovering (a yr later?) from hurricane Wilma and more than half the rooms are not in service. The rooms themselves were fine, standard rooms. We did detect a slight mildew smell due to the water leakage but could not see any signs of water damage. We could not get extra pillows the first night of our stay and had to beg the housekeeper for them the next day. Our room was not made up the next day, although we left the room before 1pm. When we complained, we were given extra towls. Next day I called the front desk AGAIN to make sure our room was made. When we came home that night, only the bed and the towels had been touched, nothing else. The garbage was piled up, the carpet had not been vacuumed, the mirror in the bathroom was gross, no toilet paper; in other words, only the bare minimum had been done. We complained again. The GM gave us a refund of two nights, which we are still waiting for from Priceline. Another problem was check in. The young lady assured us that there were no pay per view movies and would not need to swipe our credit card. When we got to the room and saw that there WERE movies, we tried to order and had to go to the front desk at 12 midnight to have our card swiped then. Last warning: there is a night club in the strip mall next door that provides a hangout for a lot of younger adults. I saw a lot of those patrons renting rooms as soon as they left the nightclub, if you know what I mean. They were using it as a motel; I saw most of these rooms being dis-occupied within a few hours after they had checked in. Not a great place to have your kids.

The front desk staff was so unaccommodating and unresponsive that they made us feel as if the theft were our fault. Despite the fact that we filed an official report with the police, contacted La Quinta coprorate headquarters, and followed up with legal filings, we were not compensated for anything. I was surprised to learn that one of the previous customers receieved a voucher for a free night due to service complaints -- not only did we have to pay for our stay that night, we were not offered any alternative compensation.
