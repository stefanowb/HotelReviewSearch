The hotel appears quite modern however upon closer inspection of the rooms it is starting to feel a little dated. I had the opportunity to be upgraded to a room on one of the executive floors (Floor 49) and had a very nice room that looked down over the pool and some nearby temples. The room was large and well equipped. The room met all my basic needs (comfortable bed, block out curtains, good aircon and hot shower). In fact the bathroom is quite large and I had a bath and a very large shower. The gym is quite large and well equipped with staff on hand to assist if needed. I ate breakfasts and lunches at the main restuarant on the 24th floor and whilst always busy, the selection was very good. My only gripe would be the elevators. There are only 4 lifts servicing what is a very large hotel. On ocassions expect a little extra dwell time whilst you wait for a lift.
