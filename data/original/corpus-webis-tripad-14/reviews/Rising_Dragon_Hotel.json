The room itself is ok. VERY hard bed which I quite like but others might not. The thing that puzzled me was that there were some things in the room that could be changed for very little money, but it seems the owners don't quite care enough. For example a moldy shower curtain. A bedside lap which doesn't work and is plugged in behind the bed which is difficult to get to, a shower head which is very old and sprays water all over the bathroom. If you look at the picture I put up, you will see that the bath has a large black \"counter\" around it and when you put the shower on and water sprays all over it and the water pools there and eventually soaks the floor. A good shower head would solve this problem.

We arrived in Hanoi after midnight - but the hotel sent a driver to greet us at no extra charge due to our 4 night stay (And they returned us at some ungodly hour in the morning). We arrived on a dark and empty street and I was worried we picked a bad location till I woke up the next morning and the streets of the historic district were buzzing. Get up really early and see the women on the street selling vegetables on yoked baskets to the Vietnamese \"before\" the other market down the block even opens. You are blocks from the Lake, the water pupperts, several outdoor markets - The Green Tangerine - an expensive (by Vietnamese standards) gourmet restaurant is across the street. The rooms were spotlessly clean - go for room 201 and the rooms above for French influenced architecture - tall ceilings - a terrace above the street - nice furnishings. But bring earplugs if you plan to sleep in because Hanoi rises early and those motorbikes have to honk at something.)Because we loved it here and wanted to stay longer we were switched to a room with a window onto a lightwell - which we liked less - but it was much less expensive than the $45 USD we spent for our room with Terrace. There is a breakfast included consisting of good vietnamese coffee, fruit, and traditional beef Pho or an omelet with french bread - both got us out the door each day. The real; reason to stay here is the people that work here - they were EXTRAORDINARY to us -kind, helpful, polite and a delight to deal with. Ask them to help you set up your next accomodations as you move on your trip - and book trips to Halong Bay with Tri at her desk in the lobby.
