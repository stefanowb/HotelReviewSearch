The breakfast is a full breakfast bar. There is an indoor and outdoor pool. The suites were comfortable and clean. It is a great value and it is quiet. It is truly a hidden jewel.

Sarah at the small but very nice bar was great, she was our barmaid when I first stayed here in 2009 when I met my now husband and she remembered us along with my parents and fellow sailors, she is a great asset to the team in this hotel. The other person who I would like to mention is JJ he was there early making sure everything was clean and tidy and he was still there late at night, he was extremely polite and once he knew we were with the sailors who were there he became my personal cheerleader!

This is our third stay at this location and the facility has detoriated. It has a terrible musty odor, the furnitue in the room looks shabby. In general the whole appearance of the hotel is not pleasant. In contrast the staff were very friendly and helpful. My biggest complaint regarding my stay was, the hotel was and is advertised as a no pet hotel. However when we arrived, the hotel was hosting a \"sugarglider\" (sugargliders are small marsupials)convention. The animals were everywhere, in the bar crawling on tables and chairs. They also were loose on the floor in public areas. What was most disturbing, is the the bar area also serves as the site for the breakfast service. This practice was unsanitary and quite disturbing to my family and I. Upon check out I voiced my concern and complaint to the front desk clerk.
