The resort opened just a few months ago and has good buzz in the region as a luxury getaway destination that's less than 40 miles from Washington.

After two or three turnarounds and re-routes on the iphone map app, we found ourselves driving onto the property via an understated driveway that lead to the resort. It is an impressive drive up to the main building and it is easy to visualize how lush and green the views would be were it not December. A young man met us to valet the car at the main entrance and another young man stood a few feet away to hold open the main door. Neither offered to help with getting our luggage out of the trunk. And upon entering the foyer we had to turn back to them to ask where the check-in desk was located ( to the left). At the desk we were warmly greeted, an offer to take the luggage was made; overall a swift check-in process, but the valets/doormen might need a refresher; they are the first impression gatekeepers.", "title": "Weekend I'll never forget!", "user": "Jesse A", "date": "December 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187726196}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The resort's main lobby is stunning. It was decorated for Christmas and presented a feeling of being in a grand---but not stuffy--living room of a great estate house. The Wine Grill is off one side of the lobby and the library , full of books and table games, off the other. Beyond the lobby rooms is the back lawn which lead to trails for the stables, a fire pit and the other amenities on the grounds. We'd requested a room on a high floor, but were told we'd have to wait a while for one to open up, so we were fine staying on the main floor in a room that was ready then. The hallways are long and beautifully decorated with photos by Ms. Johnson, artwork and tasteful furniture peices. Because the resort is more expansive ( wide) than tall ( four stories, I believe), its something of a long walk if your room is on the farther end of the buildings. Our room was exactly as described: an estate king with a large bathroom, gas fireplace and an L-shaped sofa area. It was well decorated and the furnishings, fixtures and amenities were what you'd expect in a luxury resort's room. (My wife was particularly impressed with the special face towels for removing makeup, but thought the ornate tub was too small). Absolutely no complaints about the room. Our view of the winter landscape of bare trees and brown brush was ---again, another reminder to come back in the spring.", "title": "Wonderful weekend getaway", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Laura D", "date": "December 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187553078}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled on business", "text": "We ate a late lunch in the Grill the first afternoon of our stay and found the food there was fine but basic. The service from the main waiter ( possibly the bartender) was a bit indifferent.

When we were done, he brought the check, but without a pen, and then disappeared. After nearly ten minutes of expecting him to return, I found a random resort worker and borrowed a pen from him to sign the bill. The Grill experience is the only ding that I would give to the level of service at Salamander. It fell a little below expectations and as I noticed that locals/visitors were flowing in and out of the bar ( apparently to watch football on the bar's tv), I'm assuming that they don't rely on the resort guests for their primary source of business at the Grill.", "title": "Amazing hotel and even better staff!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DebriSanFranciscoCA", "date": "December 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187372746}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Our room rate included breakfast each morning and it was excellent each day.

I wonder who else they have got like this. Other than that in room dining was excellent, they were right on time! Prompt service is what I enjoyed about in room dining. I might just come back because of in room dining. They answer the phone with such a great pleasant. Hope they lower the room rates, because it is not worth the $550/night. Step it up!!!
