The staff there are all very pleasant, and someone is onsite 24 hours a day. Breakfast is included with the cost of your stay, and is a wonderful addition to the experience. There is nothing like fresh fruit and eggs every morning to start out the day. The views are spectacular; from any of the beach apartments there is a clear line to the beach, Isla Chora, and more. My only suggestion would be to add screens to the main windows of the apartments, as during the rainy season, the bugs can really infiltrate your living space. Other than that, I highly enjoyed my time there and will definitely return. In fact, I was the only person in my group who stayed on the beach without air conditioning (everyone else had air) and many were jealous of the beach breezes.
