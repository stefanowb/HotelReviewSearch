Check-in was quick and the staff efficient and friendly. Our family room was a 2 bed suite basically, both with large en-suite bathrooms, my only minor disappointment was that I booked about 4 months in advance and asked on several occasions for the modernised family room and we got the old school one, but actually it was fine, and had a more classical Italian feel anyway. AC was ice cold luckily as 40deg most days! Breakfast on the roof terrace was as expected, plentiful, included in the price AND with stunning views. Free interrnet use on the ground floor was a perfect addition too. The hotel has a lift but a few steps lead up to it. Its truly a beautiful old building that has been carefully modernised. Walkable to the river and the centre in 10/15 mins, there is no restaurant onsite but good ones locally.

Loved the breakfast buffet on the terrace--like a wedding breakfast. Room was great--normal size for Europe but with a running shelf alongside the walls to place stuff--providing more surfaces than you get at typical American hotels. Strong air conditioning and ventilation. Didn't quite get the ironing board thing, but I didn't bother to ask. Reception was helpful. We called America using an 800 number calling card. For Italy, all calls (brief) from the room phone were not more than 1 Euro. The great find for us was a Sicilian gelateria and eatery with arancine--wow.

We were very satisfied with this hotel. We booked a superior deluxe room.

Everyone we encountered there -- the receptionists, the maid, the workers at the buffet -- were very friendly and efficient. We loved the location -- while not in the middle of the tourist area, it was a 10 minute walk to the Piazza Navona, and near a very lively avenue where the locals hang out at night for dinner, gelato, or a stroll.
