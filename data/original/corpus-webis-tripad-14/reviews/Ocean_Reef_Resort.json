I was very worried about booking a hotel off the internet. I worried until we arrived. I was quickly pleased with the hotel when we arrived. They allowed us to check in early, no charge, because we arrived in town early, and our room was ready. Check in and check out was quick and easy. the rooms were clean. the pool areawas clean. although, all the kids areas have sprinklers and different waterfall type stuff ,which can be a bit much for the little ones, but they still had a blast in it. Four hot tubs provided plenty of chances for use, not that we could. We were in a 1 bedroom condo with an ocean view. we really did have an ocean view , and with the ocean just steps from the hotel, you could just sit and watch people on beach if you wanted. In the room there was a nice washer/dryer and a decent kitchen. Only thing we found missing was a broom. It would have been very useful with my kids. the murphy beds are not good for kids, because they are to high and are above a tile floor. Also, if you have the sofa bed and the murphy bed open there is limited room to move around. Two mornings maids came right before 9 am, while a few people were still sleeping and they were noisy. On the other days we were out when they came. the beach in front of the hotel was clean.

The first day, we checked in and the message light was on, on the phone. Tried to dial out and NOTHING. I called the front desk 3 times (from my cell phone) and was told they'll be right up. After 3 hours wait, I spoke to Will who turned me over to David, the manager. The manager got someone up fast, Joel was his name and he was great. Tried to fix the phone but couldn't do it, even trying a new phone. Then we addressed a 2nd problem, the microwave and coffee pot were sitting on their shelf over the refrigerator, but there was no place to plug them in, unless you lifted them somewhere else. Joel was amazed. There were bugs and the bathroom had the ceiling taped up and all the fixtures had rust, due to the fact that the exhaust fan didn't work. We went by the front desk and told them to fix the problems, and we'd be back after dinner. We came back and Will told us they were going to give us a 5% back on our bill (they had our money in advance).

We all enjoyed are three day visit. Our two bedroom condo was ample room for the five of us. Everything was clean, and it was nice having a kitchen, washer and dryer. I thought the price was a little high at 350.00 a night, but It was prime season while we were there judging from the crowds. The pool was so crowded that if you didn't get there early in the morning there was no way you could get a pool chair. My children 7 and 4 loved the lazy river, and spent a lot of time floating around in it. I rented two beach chairs and a umbrella on the beach from the life guard for 25.00 a day. You definately need to bring your own beach towels, we didn't bring are own so we had to purchase some while we were in town. The condo was a little bit away from what appeared to be the downtown Myrtle Beach area, but it didn't really end up being a problem. We ate dinner at a good Mexican restaurant a couple of blocks from the resort. There was also plenty of other restaurants close, even walking distance. We went to Broadway on the Boardwalk two evenings while there, which was great. It was also very crowded so I recomment reservations or going early if you are planning on eating dinner at any of the trendy places like Margaritaville. One day we had lunch out side at the outside grill by the pool, and the burgers were good. Overall its a nice family place. It isn't a luxury resort as I was first expected , but a nice place to go with kids. If this had been a romantic weekend get away I think I would have wanted to stay some place more with more luxury, less people, and less noise.

Yes, the pools were great. It was nice to have an option between a covered pool and one in the sun. The hotel looks like it is in the process of beign upgraded. The common areas were lovely, but our room was just ok. We opted for a room with a kitchenette because we were going to be staying for about a week. I would not cook on those surfaces. The oven was clearly very old and outdated. However the microwave seemed relatively new. The bathroom countertops were nice, but the tub was rather unpleasant. There were old water stains from what appeared to be a leaky faucet. the first time I showered the drain emptied rather slowly. My husband shaved in the sink shortly after and the water somehow gurgled up into the tub. We called maintenance adn two guys were able to fix it. However the tub still drained rather slowly so I ended up standing in a puddle of water while showering. The sink, countertops and flooring appeared to be newer.
