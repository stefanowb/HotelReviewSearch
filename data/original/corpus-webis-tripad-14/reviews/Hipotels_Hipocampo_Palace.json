The food was outstanding in every respect. The choice on the hotplate (cooked to order) each night was fantastic, ranging from swordfish to king prawns, ostrich to pork, steak every night, the range was simply great. We did not find the hotel to be overwhelmingly \"german\". There were quite a few british couples and families staying. The Bar prices were very fair for a hotel of this quality, typically about 3.50 Euros for a 500 cl beer (about \u00a32.90). The rooms were very spacious (we were upgraded to a suite) but none really had what one could call a sea view, the hotel being set back about 250 metres from the beach. The local shops stocked an adequate choice of most holiday essentials and there were a few bars fairly close by. The resort of Cala Millor appeared to be suffering greatly from the recession. The snack bar at the hotel served very good lunchtime snacks (if you have any appetite left after breakfast).

We stayed for a short break and although we were not overlly impressed with Cala Millor itself, the hotel made up for it and was in an ideal position at the quieter end of the resort and a stones throw away from the beach. We opted for a suite which was very nice. Very comfy beds and the bathroom was lovely. It had a large balcony too which was nice. The pool area of the hotel was fantastic. It was never overcrowded as there is so much space there and an over-abundance of sunloungers. The snack area was also good, as too was the standard of service. We opted for half board and as all of the other reviews have stated, the food was excellent. So much choice and again the staff were so friendly and helpful.

The staff, especiallly on reception are excellent. We were allocated a bedroom in the main building and were very pleased, although there are no sea views, we did overlook the pool area and lawn across the road. The hotel is situated in a good area, only a short walk from the beach and yet just far enough away from the nightlife and shops. There are plenty of Spar supermarkets close by to buy all essentials. The food in the restauarant has to be seen to be believed, not only is there a very good selection but it is of an excellent standard for a buffet. The only downside is the layout of the the tables in the restauarant as they are very close to one another and also some are very close to the food area, so consequently if you are allocated one of these there are always people around you queuing for food. The hotel is spacious with plenty of areas for lounging inside and out. My only dissapointment was on checking out, as our flight was later in the day. Despite asking numerous times at reception if we could extend our room we were told to ask on the day of departure. Needless to say we could not extend and as the hotel does not provide a separate room for late departures we had to use the sauna area showers. and leave our luggage in the holding room. Most unsatisfactory for a hotel of this standard, only a minor point but should be addressed for the needs of their customers if it is to be considered a five star establishment. I must also add that the majority of the holidaymakers were German and there were quite a number of small children, which was not a problem to us but might be to some.", "title": "Worth going just for the superb food", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "coolrunnings15", "date": "July 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 71487665}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "great staff, short restaurant opening hours", "text": "As mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel has two main buildings.

The food is great, and we specially loved the fruits and sea food. Friday nights the management invites the guests to an aperitif and Thursdays they have sushi and sashimi. The papaya that I have had there was even better than in Thailand. The chocolates are probably low cacao content and not very tasty. The choices of ice-cream are also few.

Aside from the street separating different parts of the hotel, the restaurant opened at 8 a.m. which I consider is late.

There is a possibility to get cold breakfast from 7 at the coffee bar, but I found that awkward. I have never been to any hotel with such late opening time for breakfast, and believe me nobody wants a small child hungry from 7 to 8.

The connection is however poor and we had connection in only one room. We usually went to lobby to use our PCs. The TV selection was good, several English channels such as ITV, CNN and BBC.
