Our recent visit started by being greeted by the sight of a rather scruffy looking pair of lift doors as one enters the main hotel lobby; you can't miss them! A very poor impression to make in one of the main public spaces of the hotel and, judging by other comments here, maybe it belies a lack of attention to detail with regard to decor generally. We had a table booked in the restaurant so went to the bar for a pre-lunch drink. When I enquired if we could add our drinks to our restaurant bill I was told in no uncertain terms that it was impossible as the tills in the two areas were \"separate\"! Incredible in this day and age!! Having ordered three drinks which came to over \u00a320 I was then asked to pay \u00a31.50 for a small bowl of peanuts!! Surely these could have been complimentary as in so many other similar establishments.

My review relates solely to the bar in the circular lounge. I have noticed that the service is getting poorer and poorer as time goes by. Nearly always run by what appear to be badly trained staff, in a very muddled kind of set up. My visit today prompted this review. I requested 'a cup of hot water with a slice of lemon', and watched whilst a member of staff then proceeded to fill a pint beer glass with hot water from the machine. I had to stop her and point out that I had asked for a cup and not a pint glass. Is a cup of hot water with lemon such an unusual request? The cup of water was then placed on the bar, and on seeing me continue to stand there, I was then asked if I would like a saucer! On my second visit to the bar I requested the same again from another member of staff at the bar, 'a cup of hot water with a slice of lemon', and the had to stop this member of staff as she picked out a half pint glass and filled it with ice!", "title": "Fantastic location and service", "user": "Tracey B", "date": "June 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162765721}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Are the staff behind the bar trained at all in bar skills, and why do they simply not listen?

The staff in the restaurant were a delight and they enhanced an already wonderful dining experience. The food is AMAZING!! We also enjoyed the gentle entertainment during the evening...a lady singing in the bar (didn't catch her name - but she had a beautiful voice) We had a lovely room overlooking the sea, would have preferred a balcony room but that was out fault for not booking it.
