I booked our room using Priceline after reading a few reviews at TripAdvisor and I paid 175 a night when most all hotels including Best Westerns were going 175+. I arrived with my wife and son at 11 a.m. on a Friday morning and was able to check in right away with no problem at all. I had room 907 which was one of two rooms per floor with a balcony. The rooms were extremely clean. I walked the room, lobby an hallways repeatedly with my 18 month old son in our sock and they only showed the slighted amounts of dirt, so I was very comfortable letting my son crawl or walk around the room. The room was well apponted and the beds were comfortable. The staff was extremely professional and friendly. They took care of whatever I needed right away. The only thing I didnt care for was that there was a lot of corners and edges in the room (the dressers and the desk) that I covered up with extra towels incase my little one took a header into them.
