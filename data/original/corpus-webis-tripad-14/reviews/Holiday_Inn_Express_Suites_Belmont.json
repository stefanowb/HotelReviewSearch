We decided to stay outside of San Francisco itself to avoid all the traffic congestion and hassle of having to pay for parking. We arrived on a Friday night and we were quickly checked in. We got to the room and it was clean and comfy for the two of us. We checked out the bathroom and it was pretty good. We stayed a total of two nights and had an overall pleasant stay. The bed was ok, but not as comfortable as other Holiday Inn Express we have stayed at before. The room had a dual air conditioner/heater window unit (typical in most hotels). We did not have any issues with this at all. The bathroom door was a bit annoying in that it would not stay open. It would always close as if it was not level. This was not a big issue though. The morning breakfast was pretty good. Scrambled eggs, all sorts of breads/pastries, cereal, yogurts, etc. And it was included in our room rate! Most other hotels charged additional for this. Parking was also free (plenty of it available). Other reviews indicated that there were no places to eat, but I would have to differ. There was a mall not too far from the hotel (about 2.5 miles) that provided plenty of places to eat (unless you wanted to just walk a block or two). In this case, there is a subway and a couple of restaurants within walking distance. We truly enjoyed our stay.
