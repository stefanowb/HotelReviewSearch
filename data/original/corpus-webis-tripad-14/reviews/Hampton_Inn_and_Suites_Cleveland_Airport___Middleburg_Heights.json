The service was excellent, the room was very clean. Our only issue was that the room was tiny. We've never stayed in a Hampton Inn with rooms this cramped. For a family of four (2 adults, 2 kids - double Queen room) it was uncomfortable. We are not big people and we could not walk past each other in the room. The bathroom was like an alley. If you need a bit of space when you travel, choose another hotel in Middleburg Heights.", "user": "lovenyc210", "date": "September 10, 2012", "id": 139897282}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Typical Hampton Inn", "text": "Which I like, by the way.
