Especially Mario who not only obtained Papal Audience passes for my wife and I and even an unexpected guest but also on his off day went to another part of Rome and obtained a Papal Blessing document (which we had previously requested from a convent in a remote part of town). We were not only pleased with the accommodations but pleasantly surprised how much this hotel cares for its guests. Next time in Rome definitely Hotel Santa Anna.
