She was efficient and pulled our reservation right up. However she failed to mention some important info. She handed us our room key and never asked us if we were parking in the lot. This is important because you have to get your discounted parking ticket at the front desk. I first heard of this when I read the sign as we were pulling into the lot after we had already checked in. Once we found our room I went to the front desk again. This other lady was very kind and helped me, and said that the other person should have explained this to me. Oh well no biggie.
