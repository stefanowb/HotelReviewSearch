Location was a big plus for us and rooms were good. Arrived on dec 3rd long travel time almost 13 hours so were quite tired when arriving at the hotel . When we arrived at the check in desk the girl on duty asked us for Our name and identification. She then spent a few minutes on the computer and handed me the room key. Here's what annoyed me she never welcomed us to the hotel . Was this our first time here?? Because if she did not know she forgot to inform us any info about the hotel or services. When I asked if the breakfast and wifi were included she told me no that expedia bookings do not include this. I informed her that it was included in my booking . She asked me had I a booking ref and I gave it to her . And then just walked off to an office I presume to check as she did not say anything to us then returned minutes later to say there was no breakfast or wifi included on this booking. I told her there must be a mistake and she said unless I had documentation to say different she could do nothing. I asked her if there was wifi at the desk so I could retrieve my booking from my phone. I was un able to so I just took the key and said I was tired and would come back later . Sadly we ended back downstairs again because we were not told where the lift to the room was! When we got to the room We were shell shocked. First the room was smaller than before even though we booked a deluxe king room. The air con was banging away very noisy. The door on the bathroom was hanging off and the bathroom itself was in poor condition. The room was in need of a revamp.we decided we could not spend a week in this room so I made a call to hotels.com to check my booking and they told me breakfast and wifi are included in my booking and he would ring the hotel straight away to clear this up. We went back down to the check in and a new lady was on the desk. Oh boy I though the worst was over but how wrong was I. The lady at the desk Janice was her name not that she introduced herself but I took note of it later on. I explained to her that the room was not satisfactory . Room was small noisy and bathroom a poor standard. She said nothing and looked up the computer. Said to me minutes later the room had a walk in shower?? I said the room was not up to standard as we had stayed here before and the room was far better than this. She turned away and walked into an office in the back said absolutely nothing to us . Five minutes later she returned worked on the computer for a few minutes and turned away and walked back to the office. She still had not spoken to us. Minutes later she returned and worked on the computer . Another cane from the office and worked on another computer beside her and five more minutes later she handed us keys to a new room. So far this has tale 15 mins approx and the only words spoken to us was the fact the room had a walk in shower! I asked her was the breakfast and wifi included with this room as the booking company rang during the process to confirm they spoke to the hotel. Without even checking she said it was not as expedia do not include breakfast and wifi in their bookings! I informed her that the booking company rang to confirm they spoke to the hotel when she disappeared to the office. Again without a word she turned and yes again went back to the office. Five more minutes later she returned spent five more minutes later writing and handed me five vouchers. I then asked was my wifi included and she told me it was . I then had to ask if I needed some sort of password to access the wifi and she told me what I had to do to access it. We went to our room. We have travelled the world over the past 15 years and we have stayed in the best and not so good hotels in our time.

I had invited my aunt who lives in New York to have dinner with us and I had the steak which was good, but my two aunts shared the lamb. We had other side dishes including brocolli which were cold and quite disguting. We belive the lamb was off as that night my two aunts were sick and constantly throwing up. We feel they both had food poisoning. When we discussed this matter with the hotel manager -they first argued that this was not the case even though they refunded the food and sent up us fruit etc. BUT A FEW MONTHS LATER THE HOTEL RECHARGED MY AUNTS CREDIT CARD WITHOUT TELLING HER OR GIVING HER ANY EXPLANATION OF AN AMOUNT 0VER $300.

It is located in the Times Square area, and several Broadway theaters are within 1-3 blocks. There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well. The hotel itself is nicely decorated. I stayed in a corner city-view room, which offered impressive views of the city. The room was average in terms of size but above average in terms of decoration and comfort. The shower features 2 shower heads. It might not be good for the environment, but it sure felt good. The air conditioning was not able to keep up with the 100 degree weather as much as I would have liked, but the room was fairly comfortable. Overall, this is a very nice hotel in a good location.

First, I have been to NYC more times than I can count, but never stayed in Time Square, now I know why. I am in my 20's and love this city, but Time Square actually has a lot more low lifes in it then good people, so if you want a more peaceful hotel that is near the same places, stay on 5th ave. I speak from experience the quality of the people is just better. Second, my 2 complaints for the actual room was this, there is no fan in the bathroom so it is like a sauna, and the sink is so small that you cannot fir your items on it. Lastly the biggest thing, my sister left her wallet (with no cash, but credit card and license!!) in our room because it didn't fit in her tiny purse. We didn't realize it until the next morning when we had to leave, but her wallet (with her photo ID) to get on the plane was missing!! A maid took it and we later found, used it at the hotel vending machine (debit/credit card). The staff denied maids in the room at this time, but this is not true due to the fact that I was w/ my sis and saw her place the wallet on the dresser. We almost missed our flight, and had to go fill out a police report for her to even get on the plane, such a fiasco. Anyway. this was upsetting along w/ the treatment of the situation.I realize one should not leave a wallet lying in plain sight in a room, but still is was just shady and plain wrong.

The room we had been appointed was nothing special, no bath although it did have very good views from the 38th floor. The following day I spoke to a lady at reception saying how disappointed we were that it was not a little more special for our anniversary and she said she would see if she could do anything although it was unlikely as they were so busy.

The room was better and we had a bath and amazing views from the windows but it is definitely not really the sort of hotel for a romantic break.

We had a wonderful cruise along the Hudson River at night and also a lovely meal at River Cafe just the other side of Brooklyn Bridge which was very special.

When we arrived, the hotel had decided to change our reservations. Luckily I had an email confirmation regarding the original rooms we had booked. TIP: Bring any reservations via email with you as you never know if they will try to give you something else. As a result of my presenting my original reservations we were upgraded to the corner rooms which were great in size. They are very very large for any hotel in any city. The amenities were poor. We had to constantly ask for towels and toiletries. You may need to call for the same thing a few times before you finally get a response. Even if you complain that your phone isn't working for incoming calls and they send someone to investigate, it still won't be taken care of.
