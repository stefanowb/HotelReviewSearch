I suppose Victorian is just a nice way of saying old. Yes, true, Boston is an old city ...with a tremendous amount of charm. I actually loved Boston. However, for the price you pay at Buckminster, old hard beds with musty smelling sheets and a stand alone sink with NO counter space at all in the bathroom leaves something to be desired. I do have to say that the breakfast at the teeny little restaurant (and I do mean teeny) downstairs was actually quite tasty. To their credit, they were renovating the lobby at the time, but still that seem to have no bearing on the old hard beds and must sheets. However, our next trip to Boston was exactly one year later in 2005, and we stayed at the Radisson which is just across the river...and loved it.

Things we loved were that the hotel was literally across the Turnpike from Fenway Park and right on Commonwealth Ave, the low rate (159.00) for a king suite within city limits and the proximity to the subway. All those things are as advertised and the hotel is a great spot to have as a home base. We stayed on the 5th floor of the 6 floor hotel. The elevator although a little small was clean and not slow. The king bed was newer, firm and very comfortable to sleep in. The living room was nice to have as we like to spread out and that's nearly impossible if you just have a single room with a bed. The hotel (what we observed) itself was NOT dirty and dingy or smelly. The room was clean with only some dust on the high dresser in the bedroom. Behind the bed was clean(always a sign of lazy cleaning when dirty) and vacuumed. The double windows and shutters did dampen some of the inner city noise but not all( hey, it's a BIG city). We expected some traffic noise considering it's location and were not bothered by what did come through. The room (all of them ) had a working refridgerator and microwave and there was a clean, large cooking area with sinks and a stove on each floor. When we had to deal with the staff they were all courteous and helpful. The weather temperature was perfect so we needed no heat or air conditioning so I can't rate how they worked. Self parking was readily available for 18.00 a day right next door and the attendant there was courteous. There were some slight spotting on the room carpet but nothing drastic at all. My biggest and probably only complaint was the bathroom towels. They were not up to snuff as they were thin, old, and although cleaned and hopefully bleached, were spotted, as were the replacements that were given to us without a problem. I would suggest bringing a couple of your own towels or do as we did, dry off with some clean, extra tee shirts. The continental breakfast is nothing but some tupperwares filles with bread, bagels,muffins, etc served inside the attached Japanese restuarant and we passed on it. McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts are both right next door and will fill the gap for you. We live just 90 miles away in W. Massachusetts, so we know the area well and I can tell you from experiance that this is a good location to have as homebase for a few days, especially if you don't like driving alot. As stated earlier , the subway (Green Line/Kenmore Station) is just a couple blocks from The Buckminster and can take right to most attractions in the city including North Station where you can get a commuter train and will take you to just about any cities that are around Boston from Plymouth to Glouchester/Newberryport to Providence, RI.. The place isn't the Ritz but for the price I know that I'll be giving them another try at some point.
