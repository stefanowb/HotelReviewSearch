The food is class, the only minor criticism I have is dessert. They make their own deserts & they are lovely but its the variety I would like to see changed. They do crumbles & meringues & things but I have a savage sweet tooth & would like to see more on the menu. That said its a minor thing & probably a personal thing that wouldn't even bother others. I love the duck there, also I would recommend the chowder. One thing is for sure you won't leave hungry. We like to go down especially at halloween when there are fireworks on the beach across the road. Overall a really high standard of food & nice staff.", "title": "Lovely Evening Meal", "user": "Amy B", "date": "May 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 129805533}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "Recommended by our cottage owners for Sunday lunch.
