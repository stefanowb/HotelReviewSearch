We arrived from Sevilla in the early afternoon and we had backpacks with us; we knew our room would not be ready. Also, we would be checking out the next morning and had Alhambra tickets and didn't want to have to haul around our luggage. So I emailed ahead and asked if they would be able hold our luggage both days and they quickly replied that yes, it would be no problem! The hotel is centrally located on Gran Via de Colon, which is a major thoroughfare through Granada. We were SO pleased when we arrived, pleasantly greeted and they locked our bags into a room right off the lobby so we could explore Granada until our room was ready. We returned a couple hours later and were told our rooms were ready. We rounded the corner and saw the beautiful sitting area! We took the all glass elevator up to the 3rd floor and we were in the end suite. Much to my surprise, it was a HUGE apartment (I missed that they were apartments somehow!) done up in wonderful colors and textures! We had a bedroom view of the courtyard and a city view off the patio. The kitchen/living area was in warm colors and stainless appliances...plus a sofa bed. The bathroom was stocked for TWO people (toiletries) and the blow dryer was not the standard hotel issue, but a full size (which is important when you both have a full head of curly hair!), which made us thrilled since we didnt carry one with us! The bedroom was in soft muted tones, with great lighting and MEMORY FOAM mattresses and pillows!! We had the BEST night sleep the entire trip here (we even overslept on accident)!! 2 flatscreen TV's--in living area and bedroom. We walked again around the city and had a light fare at the Restaurante Asador El Aguador - Pizzer\u00eda which was simply delicious. The next morning we checked out and again, they held our bags for us in the locked room. We toured the Alhambra all day (DO NOT MISS IT) and as we left, it began to rain. we decided to grab another bite to eat before we headed back to the bus station and since we enjoyed our meal the day before so much, we returned to Restaurante Asador El Aguador - Pizzer\u00eda (right by the Cathedral) for another meal. Since it had outdoor seating, we wern't sure where we'd sit, but they not only enclosed the area with a tent, they moved in patio heaters so we could enjoy our meal without freezing (temps dropped quickly in the rain) We returned to the Suites Gran via 44 to retrieve our bags and we were welcomed to dry off and get situated before we had to catch a taxi. I will tell you that taxis are scarce in the rain in Granada. They hotel offered to call one, but another guest waited an hour, so we took our chances. It took about 30 minutes and every taxi passed us by and we were standing by a taxi stand!
