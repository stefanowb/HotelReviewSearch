The rooms advertised on their website do not live up to the rooms you are given. The rooms shown on the website are apparently their executive suites. We were given a deluxe room which isnt even shown on the hotels website. We were then moved to another room which had bed bugs. I dont know what the procedure is with dealing with bed bugs, as this was a first for us, but I do not think the hotel dealt sufficiently with our personal effects to be sure they were not infected. We felt the rooms were dirty, especially at the base of the walls and edge of carpet, the bathrooms are very tiny. The pool closes at 9p.m. which was a real pain as when you are hot and tired after a hot day/night in Singapore it would have been lovely to have had a swim to cool down.
