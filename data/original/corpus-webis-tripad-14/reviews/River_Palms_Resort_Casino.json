If you're up for a dirty room, poor service and oh having to wait for 4 hours after check in to actually get your room, this is the place. We booked a parlor suite (2 bedrooms with a sitting area in the middle) more than a month prior to our arrival. When we arrive we were told at check in that the parlor may still need to be cleaned but if so call right down and it would be taken care of. So we trek it up to the 23rd floor (all the while with a senior in a wheelchair) and find our key cards do not work. Only the key to the parlor gained us access. This by the way was dirty. So we call the front desk and of course we get instructions on how to use the key card...well we were in one of the rooms so obviously we were not total morons. They send up the tech to check the locks. We get access to one room and find the other is still occupied. So we call down to the front desk, again. And are told they would be happy to move us to another room. We explain that will not do since again, we have someone in a wheelchair and we need a shared room. Well, none available. Okay after being on the phone with them and being told nothing they could do until they locate the other guest, as they could not move their things, even though they should have been checked out at 11AM, it's now 5:30 PM (oh and another tidbit, they \"technically\" as they explained have until 5:30 to have the room cleaned).", "title": "Horrible - Take reviews of low ratings seriously", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "dlinza", "date": "February 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 25318873}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "So down the 23 floors I go to the front desk.

So he says we can take care of that, but of course when I explain it's a suite, no go. He heads behind the door to the back office. Another 15 -20 minutes later he emerges with the supervisor Trish and they head to the other end of the counter, leaving me with still no communication of what will be done. Okay another 10 - 15 minutes or so they head my way. Trish tells me they've located the guest he is moving out now and they apologize for the issue...and the room will be cleaned ASAP (right). I push and get dinner buffet comps. Whoopee, okay it's now 6:30ish and we head to the buffet, wait another 30 minutes. Eat, gross, glad it was free and head up to the room. Surprise...it's not clean. Check with the current maid on the floor, sorry no English and we are not on the list to be cleaned. Back down the 23 floors we go...straight to the counter and of course the response \"oh unacceptable\". So they'll have it cleaned within 10 minutes.", "title": "Need to print a new Schedule!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MarineT", "date": "February 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 25212526}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "hotel needs help", "text": "Instead of opting to enjoy the casino we head up to make sure we get clean sheets. That was a good choice as the beds were made and when I asked about clean sheets the maid said no, same people. No not same. Well we decided it best to sit in the parlor with the door open to the room and have a glass of wine (no room service we brought our own) and enjoy the \"the cleaning channel\" aka watch the maid clean the room. So we were in Laughlin for about 4 hours before we were \"technically\" checked in. Which of course I was told at the front desk, well you are checked in, I said technically, but not physically. All in all you're better off going to Las Vegas and deal with the crowds. Laughlin is old, worn out, customer service is unheard of and the hotel \"this hotel\" is horrible.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bleeray", "date": "February 5, 2009", "id": 24275775}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "One last note, we passed 2 more guests in the elevator who had the exact same issue, given a room that was already occupied", "title": "Don't miss the mystery spot", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "LeftytheRebelKnitter", "date": "February 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 24217169, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 price"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Was very nice, but need more people at check in desk, to move travelers signing in. Had to stand in line about 25 minutes. Hotel has a printed pamplet in room, showing times and hour, of which a 1/3 was incorrect, places were closed (forever) times of openings and closings were wrong on some. It is annoying to go to a place and find they are closed. The breakfast buffet has really improved, but no more service help, you have to get your coffee and juice or water yourself, and it is in a corner, outside the food area, you have to carry that back to your table. you have put in sugar & cream at the area , where you get the drinks. The hotel is very clean, I checked my bed for you know what. The service people are very nice and helpful. We played Bingo, the people running the game were sweet and helpful. We had the $2.99 special (Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon ,eggs, toast.) at the the cafe but coffee was an added $1.75. The buffet was 6.99 with all kinds of breakfast food, it is a better value, they will make eggs any way you want.
