We put our valuables in the free safe which was a bonus. We then had our first treatment which was a soothing back & neck massage which was lovely. We then headed to the spa to make full use of the steam rooms and ice cave. It wasn't very busy at as far as we were concerned, but some disgruntled \"regulars\" were complaining how busy it was for a Wednesday, obviously not used to having to share a steam room or sauna with more than two people. The buffet lunch on our package was held in the Grand Prix suite and was cream of vegetable soup to start, then a choice of beef chilli with rice or a mushroom dish. There were also salads and cold meats on offer. In the evening we had dinner in Astons restaurant which was excellent. We both had the roasted pepper tart to start, then the rump steak for mains which was cooked to perfection. Breakfast the next morning was buffet style and there was a good selection of continental and full English options on offer. The staff were very polite on all occasions we spoke with them.

Facilities are excellent but there were a few minor niggles, which didn't detract from our enjoyment, and one that did. Was looking forward to using the jacuzzi but after a couple of minutes we were all forced to leave, eyes stinging from over-chlorination. In addition it started to cause a rash on my arm and leg. Watching over half an hour or so nobody stayed in there for more than a couple of minutes, all leaving whilst rubbing their eyes. From other reviews I can see this has occurred before so it would seem that their control over chorination isn't what it should be. It was dangerously toxic around the jacuzzi in my opinion.
