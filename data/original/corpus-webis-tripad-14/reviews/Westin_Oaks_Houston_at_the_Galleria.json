Our first room was unacceptable due to 3 burned out lightbulbs (although the room was still way too dark even after those lightbulbs were replaced), stains on the carpet, leaky faucets and an unpleasant smell. Our \"balcony\" was simply a dark, concrete alley with puddles of water everywhere, which we shared with many other guests. The next room also had burned out lightbulbs, leaky faucets, a smell and a dirty carpet. Finally, we decided we wanted to check out the Westin Galleria (sister hotel w/in Galleria). The room change was easy and the Westin Galleria was SLIGHTLY nicer. It had less of a smell and seemed like it was a bit newer, but still not what you would expect for a \"4 star\" hotel. Bottom line-the Westin Oaks and Westin Galleria are not worth it! They seriously need to be cleaned and renovated. Better management is also necessary. Obviously, Westin thinks it can get away with not keeping up these 2 hotels because of their location.
