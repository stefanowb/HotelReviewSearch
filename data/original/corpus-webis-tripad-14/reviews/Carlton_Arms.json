It was described as a kind of cheap and cheerful place with a good location. Upon arrival we were given 3 keys to 3 rooms for us to choose from. The first two were run down and grotty. The third, the best of the three which we chose was not great either. There was an offensive smell of cat urine in the hall outside our room. There was a brown stain on the bed and bleech stains on the towels. There was no hot water and the pressure of the shower was non existant. The bedding comprised of one sheet when it was 6 degrees outside. This hotel was not for us and we ended up finding alternative accomodation for our weeks stay in Manhattan. I wouldn't say that the location was fantastic although it was OK. I would not recomend this hotel to any couples who are after a romantic holiday. This hotel would suit students who are used to living in unclean poor accomodation. The safety of the hotel is also suspect. On arrival we were given a pad lock to put on our door when were left the hotl.
