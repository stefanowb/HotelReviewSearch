The inner courtyard (now roofed) is supported by surprisingly slender marble columns only 10\" across, and none of the public spaces are \"palatial.\" This makes it more like a \"normal\" hotel than many - neither good nor bad, just different. Rooms are on the ground and first floors with various aspects. We had ground floor side which opened out to an inner courtyard serving the bar and could have been noisy if people had been up late. I think first floor front would be good as the street outside seems pretty quiet at night. Our room was on two levels and perfectly comfortable.

The public parking is just about 400 m straight ahead, there was a parking lot, but this is low season. Anyhow, once you've carried your luggage over the plaza to the hotel reception, onwards to the room we got help. The hotel, the former Palacio de De\u00e1n Ortega), is the dominant building of the plaza beside the impressing El Salvador church (must visit), and the palacio initially makes kind of gloomy but powerful look, due to the small and barred windows on the first floor making it look somewhat like a prison (but that was the style of the time), but as soon as you enter the patio (now covered by glass roof), it immediately feels more friendly. The building is also a kind of museum, so the public (e.g. school classes on excursion) enter to look around, though that did not really disturb, as the private parts of the building are reserved for the guests (called clients). We had booked a \"special room\", and so it was that we had a huge room (at least 4 m height) with direct access to a private andalusian garden with a typical fountain in the middle. Given the location in the centre of the town, this was very relaxing and in the morning you wake up by the chirping of countless birds. We had an outstanding dinner at the restaurant at a low price (25Euro) with 10 tapas as starter! Breakfast was equally good, specially the fried eggs made to order were excellent, also due to the local olive oil used. The second evening we had a tasty snack at the bar in the basement, which is quite pleasant while the television at the bar showed a football match (a Copa Real classico). Something to mention is that weather was quite cold, on third day even some sleet, but the heating of the room was efficient and very quiet. Also to mention is that the staff is overall friendly and helpful.
