I booked it online and was just looking for something cheap for one night so 79 euro suited. My first impressions of the area were not good, the hotel was situated in a ghetto area surrounded by high rise flats and some undesirable locals as we found on a trip to the nearest shops. The man at reception who checked us in was friendly and wished us a pleasant stay. The room was basic as expected with 3 star hotel, within minutes of entering the room the children hopped upon the beds and my wife decided to open the window to let some air in, what she wasn't expecting was the complete window panel 6ft by 4ft to come crashing in on top of her, luckily whatever way it landed she avoided serious injury and thankfully the children had been sitting on the beds at the time as the 2 year old would most certainly have been seriously injured. I lifted the complete window frame off her then went to reception to complain, they apologised and moved us to the room next door but didn't seem to appreciate how serious the incident was. We were just glad to get our heads down after a lot of travelling. The next morning we found that the hot water wasn't working in the shower which was disappointing, however the real surprise came after checking out whilst awaiting the shuttle bus to the airport. We were standing in the lobby and were approached by a man who informed us he was the Duty or General manager of the hotel. I was expecting him to state he was going to offer a full refund after our near death experience, but instead he started to accuse us of breaking the window, my wife became very upset at this and had to walk away, but he kept insisting that nothing like this had ever happened in the hotel and we must be at fault, I explained he was very lucky that no-one was killed as result of this faulty window and that we hardly even complained about the matter. He still insisted on laying the blame with us and I had to walk away myself as I could not believe his ignorance. I will never stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone even for one night!!!
