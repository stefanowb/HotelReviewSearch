If your there for business, I imagine it depends on how and where you need to go, but for the tourist this really worked well for us. It was close enough to Beacon Hill, Little Italy, and even the Back Bay area for us to walk, but taking the subway or trolley works well too. We had a car, I would recommend against this, unless you want to spend a ton of money. we needed to get into further away areas, so the car was needed, but the cost is about $50 a night to park at the hotel, that's the most I've ever paid for car parking at a hotel.
