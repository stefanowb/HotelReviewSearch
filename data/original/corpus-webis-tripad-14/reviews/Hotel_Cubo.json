The room was clean, the decor was modern but comfortable, and the bathroom was large. The service was fantastic. The breakfast was also way beyond my expectations with a lot of healthy options (as well as decadent options). The hotel is just a few minutes walk to the river shops and sites. When I went there wasn't a fitness facility in the hotel, but there is an absolutely beautiful park, Tivoli Park, just a few minutes from the hotel where you can walk or jog - and I highly recommend it! I've been a runner for 15 years and the wooded park trails were so beautiful that it is definitely in my top 3 best runs ever.", "title": "Great room", "user": "BB_Paige_Fresno", "date": "January 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149830724}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "My husband, adult son and I spent 4 great days at the hotel Cubo.

In fact the dinner we had at the hotel in our last night was one of the best dinners we had in Ljubljana. The only suggestion we'd like to offer the hotel is to dim the lights in the restaurant at dinner time to give it more ambience.

The second element was the food! Although the kitchen wasn't open on Sunday, the breakfast was delicious. Amazing jam the kind you just want to eat with a spoon, coffee was great.
