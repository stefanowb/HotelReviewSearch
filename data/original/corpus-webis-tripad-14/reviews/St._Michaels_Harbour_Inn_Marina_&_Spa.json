He acknowledged the discount was valid and I met all the discount criteria. The next day when I received the email confirmation for our stay, the rate did not reflect the agreed-upon discount. When I spoke to the front desk manager, I was told that the reservationist \"doesn't know what he's talking about\" and that the discount is included in the standard package rate. After some discussion, the front desk manager got very defensive, telling me that she will not honor the rate I was quoted at the time of reservation and then told me I would have to pay a $25 cancellation fee if we chose not to come. Nowhere on the Spafinder site or the Harbour Inn site does it state that the discount is already included, and the math just simply doesn't add up. In fact, on Spafinder, the discount is advertised as a savings. In general, when a company advertises a savings, that would be discounted from the standard rate, not part of the standard rate.
