We stayed at the Holiday Inn 3 night is September. It was a beautiful stay. The room was beautiful and large for European standards. Hotel is very well situated for seeing Paris. The hop-on-hop off bus (a great way to see Paris) is right in front. We walked from Gare de Lyon station and the Air France bus to the airport. Also, easy walk to Notre Dame and Marais district. But the best part, was the breakfast. Excellent. If it is included in the price, it is an excellent deal. We will definately stay here again on our next trip to Paris.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Maryseattle", "date": "September 23, 2006", "id": 5829187}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful and even though we arrived early they were still able to check us in and give us a lovely room with a balcony.
