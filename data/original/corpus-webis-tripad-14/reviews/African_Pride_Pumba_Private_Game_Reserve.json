I am in definite agreement with many of the reviews posted on here. I stayed for 3 nights and every day was incredible. The staff was always eager to please and it seems they have thought of everything. We enjoyed having the hot chocolate waiting for us after every game drive....and even dropped in a bit of amarula to kick it up a notch.... the warm towels was a nice treat too. Enjoying cocktails and dinner next to a crackling fire was lovely. The menu choices included a little something for everyone.

We were in the bush lodge for three night and the room was so beautiful- we visited the water lodge and it was fun to have a meal over there, but we preferred our room to the room we saw at the water lodge. Our guide (Justin) was so fun and knowledgeable and made each game drive really special. We were paired with another young couple for our game drives and it was really fun getting to know them. One morning we decided to do a game walk instead of a game drive and it was a neat experience- I would recommend. The food was really good and the service was the best we'd ever experienced. The game drives were amazing and we saw all of the big five except leopards, plus lots of other animals. It was only about 1.5 hours from Port Elizabeth and easy to find (there is a long dirt road that leads up to the entrance- at first we thought maybe we were lost, but we weren't- just keep going). We thought it was worth every penny, and actually a great value when you think about the cost of paying for food, great accommodations and game drives with a ranger. I did a lot of research before choosing this place and it seemed like the best deal with the best reviews and it exceeded all our expectations (which were really high).
