It is located in the near the center and right across the beach. At the first sight, hotel was bright and clean. The reception staff is most of the times reserved and unfriendly, but generally efficient and helpful. And that is my only remark. The rooms are spacious, bright, clean and well equipped. Meals were excellent. Good variety and everything was delicious. The beach was just across the street eith sunbeds and umbrellas provided free of charge. You can also get beach towels with 5 EUR deposit. Pools at the hotel looked nice, although I do not use pools when I am at the seaside.
