It was my husband and my 10 month old daughter. The hotel was very accommodating by giving us a crib, a microwave, a fridge, and a quiet room for our baby. The decor was nice - the bathroom was ok. We ordered room service from Kya in the hotel and the food was tasty but not hot. The appetizers were hot but our entrees were not. Our friends stayed in a suite and those were phenomenal. Very pretty. They had 2 wall mounted televisions, and large sitting area, and tile floors - which are a plus to me as far as cleanliness is concerned. The pool was nice (saltwater), but it was a little warm. Great for night swimming, but not very refreshing for daytime.

We also enjoyed the 24 hour pool. It was so nice to be able to swim no matter what time we returned from Disneyland. We did not walk to Disneyland because of the age of my niece, but it was definitely close enough to walk and the hotel has very easy access to Disney's parking structure.

It was like sleeping next to the interstate most of the time as the walls are so thin, and really, how quiet can it be 25 yards from the busiest road in California -- to drown out the noise we used the equally noisy airconditioner - which at least was constant rather than the whoosh of cars and trucks.", "title": "Avoid", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "bikoparrot", "date": "June 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 33259214}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "this is a cheap property which has a veneer of 'boutique' to it.

The big circular chairs near the pool is very comfortable, big enough for 2.

Yes its noisy outside but you get used to it, we live in a small town backing onto a forest, so if I can sleep here with the noise anybody can.

We stayed at the Hotel Menage due to its location and price range. This hotel is an older hotel that has been remodeled with a funky vibe, from flowing sheers in sitting area, to blue ambiance lighting in bar area, with contrasting flickering red candles on bar counter. The tiki bar along side of the pool outdoors is a great spot to sit in the evenings and watch the Disneyland fireworks from next door. Our room was clean and spacious, with king size bed, and an air-conditioner that worked wonderfully. The K'Ya restaurant serves a great breakfast as well as a great main meal menu. Be sure to try the Calamari, it is very tasty. The lobby bar and the pool bar both serve happy hour menus from 4-7pm, with 1/2 price food and drink, awesome!! There is also a computer room that is free of charge to use day or night. It is in need of a couple desk lights as it is dim when trying to see the keyboards, but other than that \"free to use\" was great. The pool area was very clean with great tables and chairs, and \"beds\" to sit at or lay on. The pool was always in use, day and night. A 10 minute walk takes you to Disneyland Resort, while a 20 minute walk took you to The Garden Walk shopping area just past. Across from Disneyland are restaurants such as Mimi's, McDonald's, Subway, etc. It is a very pretty walk, all lit up at night, and very safe. BUT the very best thing about this Hotel was the people. Very friendly and very helpful. Look for Frank at the bar, he is the best. He will go out of his way to do whatever he can to make your evening pleasurable. He is a people person who makes contact with his customers and gets to know them. He even went as far as getting my husband 2 bottles of ginger-ale for a migraine headache when he was sick. He got us 2 bottles of water when he saw we were hot, AND picked out, himself, a very yummy entre for me to try on our last evening there...that being the calamari as stated before. This is not a 5 star hotel, nor does it claim to be. As reported, it is a 3 star BUT with 5 star people. If you go, say hi to Frank for me, from here in NS, Canada.

It appealed to me as I was a single parent travelling with a child and didn't want to be totally stuck in family land. Best things about the hotel.. the front staff are SO friendly and helpful. The lobby and bar are very stylish and modern. The pool is really lovely, better than the photo on their website. Disneyland is about a 10 minute walk straight down the road. You have to cross a couple of roads but they have pedestrian crossings so it's perfectly safe. It was great to be so close to Dland as we could easily come home and have a swim and food and go back on nights it was open to 12.00. We ate breakfast there every day and as kids eat free this worked out very reasonable. Big breakfasts and endless coffee, Yay! There is a happy hour from 4 - 7 pm every night and all the bar food is half price so you can really save a fortune by eating this way and you can have it at the pool if you want .Note only Local beer and wine was half price- I didn't realise this till I was half way through my Spanish red. The rooms were smaller than they seem in the photos. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. No fridge but there is an ice bucket and a free ice machine. Coffee maker but no jug or tea making facilities. Directly over the road is a starbucks, taco bell and convenience store that sells beer and wine and odd bits of fruit. Take a corkscrew if you like to buy a bottle of wine. Overall I found Menage to be really lovely and the food bill for seven days was extremely reasonable which made it a doubly good reason to stay there. One slight bummer was that the spa was closed which meant the pool heating wasn't working either so I didn't swim at all as it was far too cold for me. They said it would be fixed within a few days and by the time I left the sign was out again saying it would be fixed within a week. i wonder if this is an ongoing problem. Re a previous trip advisor I specifically asked for quiet room.
