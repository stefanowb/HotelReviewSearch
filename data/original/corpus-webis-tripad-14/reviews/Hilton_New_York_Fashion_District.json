Again, I will be honest with you when I will tell you that I truly believe you pay for what you get...but after booking rooms that have range from $350.00 to $425.00 a night I was a bit hesitant when I found the HIlton New York Fashion District and only paying $137.00 a night. I read the reviews and questioned myself over and over again. Then finally I booked it with the hotel directly. Chelsea, who helped book the reservations was friendly and had a great personality. I checked in this past Sunday to be greeted by professional staff members. Although my room was not ready at time of arrival I understood it was only 11am and may have to wait until 3pm to do so. They stored my luggage and off I went to hit the town. The location is perfect for those who want to do Uptown or Downtown. It's close to the subway and a skip and a hop from 34th Street. Finally, I received the call around 3pm that my room was ready...Whaalla! I opened the door to room 211 and was very suprised. Not only was the room equipped with a MP3 player, Keurig, large flat screen mounted on the wall but also had all the ammeneties that you would need to make your overnight stay comfortable. Overall, if you are looking for a great, clean hotel that is going to leave your pocket full then choose this Hilton property where you will find the staff pleasant but also very eager to help you in any way.
