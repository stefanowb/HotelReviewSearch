As many have said Izzy who runs the bar is an absolute star, a real credit to the place and cooks a great full English.

This is more suitable for adults. The beds are a bit hard and the pool is cold (as is usual in Spain in winter), but we have stayed here before, and would stay again. We have recommended it to other people and they agree and are also going back. The bungalows are made to be quite private.

The flights stop after a Certain time at night and start arriving about 8am. Great for the beach and the shopping complex and restaurants. 10 mins from the airport, so you can get a taxi (or the bus ). Overall, it's perfect.
