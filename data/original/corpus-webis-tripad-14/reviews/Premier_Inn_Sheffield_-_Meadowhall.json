Hotel is fine, if very noisy. But the restaurant is a disaster area. The food was ok, but staffing levels, speed and efficiency defy any logical thinking at all. 20 odd tables served by 2 staff, one of which was working her 5th night, and needed some serious training. Several tables got completely the wrong order, one guy didn't get his meal at all, and my three courses took over 2 hours! And I had to chase the waitress across the room just so I could get my order taken, as she just kept ignoring me. Unbelievable!!
