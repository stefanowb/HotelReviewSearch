The room is large. well decorated and beds are comfortable. I think we had one of the better rooms, overlooking a little green scrap of park and facing south. The worse points wouldnt have mattered if it had been a cheaper place, but for the money it's just that I have had better value elsewhere. (There was too much \"OK\" and no \"WOW!\" in other words.) The buffet breakfast was OK - the scrambled eggs were burned yet were still put out for the guests to eat. Not a great selection of cereals, breads, etc. not bad, but just ....average. The bedside lights weren't comfortable to read by, although there was plenty of lighting. The district, though not far from the centre, was sort of suburbanl, not many places to eat locally if you didn't want Indian or the hotel restaurant (after the burned eggs, I was wary of the latter) and there was no vibe to the district at all. There was an electricity saving system in the hotel which is theoretically good - but it meant you had to remember to put your key in a slot as soon as you entered your room, so the electricity would keep working. I kept timing it wrong, putting the key in before the room door was shut, or forgetting and then being in the bathroom when the electricity suddeny went off, etc.! Towels were barely adequate, small and thin. Toiletries OK, nothing luxurious. I just didn't feel it was a hotel I wanted to return to, but if you're already booked there, don't cancel ....I think you'll find it is okay even if does not thrill you. .", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 4, 2008", "id": 15636135}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008", "text": "Markish Museum Metro (U2) Entrance just at the door of the hotel.
