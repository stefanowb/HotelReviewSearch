All the hotels recommended for the trip down from NYC were too expensive! Always an adventure with Tripadvisor, but were not disappointed. Everything in the other reviews is true! We got the cheapest queen, and although not large, extremely commodious.

It's a charmingly decorated historic building in a beautiful downtown residential neighborhood just a few blocks from major cultural and civic attractions. The staff are extraordinarily friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable, and take meticulous care of the property; they all seem to enjoy running such a fine place. Our king-bed room had bay windows with a great view of the Philadelphia skyline - and all the windows (including the bathroom window) actually opened! Some other things we really appreciated: (1) We arrived rather early in the day. They watched our luggage while we went around town, and then let us check in early so we could be ready for a matinee concert at the Kimmel Center. (2) There are two free internet computers in the basement fitness room. (Don't you hate paying for internet access?) (3) There's a vending machine with cold Poland Spring water for $1 a bottle - not as good as free, but a lot better than the usual warm bottle for which you're charged $5 or more. All in all, an extraordinary experience and an excellent value. If they'd add hard boiled eggs to the breakfast buffet they'd be perfect.", "title": "Deserving of all the glowing reviews", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "museumgoer", "date": "March 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14669689}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled on business", "text": "My apartment in the city is not big enough for myself and two of my friends, so I heard about the Alexander Inn and booked 2 rooms.They have great rates. We were greated by a terrific staff and the general manager John who made us feel right at home. He gave us lots of good suggestions on where and what to do in the area of the hotel which is very hip. Our rooms were both comfortable and stylish we overlooked spruce street which was fun to people watch. In the morning there is a great breakfast and we had good conversations with the staff and other guests.
