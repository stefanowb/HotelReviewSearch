I'm happy to say we were pleasantly surprised with our week's stay. No, this is not a luxury resort. No, it doesn't offer the last word in pampering. But it is a very pleasant facility, with an excellent beach, fantastic pool, good (again, not gourmet) food, and a friendly staff. Although it doesn't compare to some of the all inclusive resorts we've stayed at in the Riviera Maya, we paid about half of what we paid there and had a resort experience that was, for the most part, equally enjoyable! For the money, the Sirenis Cocotal represents an excellent value and we would (and probably will) return. Only one word of caution....be carefull when using the hotel phone to place international calls. We used our calling card and still got charged over $70 by the hotel system....something about 800# calls not getting through the normal line and being automatically switched to a pay service. I'd use the lobby phone to make calling card calls next time and avoid the in-house system altogether. If you're thinking of going to the Sirenis, take the negative reviews with a grain of salt and enjoy!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 21, 2004", "id": 2095219}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good relaxing holiday", "text": "Went to the Sirenis in March 04.

The staff were friendly throughout the holiday but you found that the women got served at the bar quicker than the men! The room was cleaned everyday and was always spotless. The pool and beach were always clean. The food wasnt too great, breakfast was very disappointing, we ended up just having toast every morning for the whole 2 weeks. The buffett lunch and dinner was okay but very hit and miss. I would defintely recommend the stak house though. The shop on site is very expensive and make sure you take high factor sun tan cream cos the highest they have in the shop is factor 4! We both had an upset stomach in the second week which was down to the food but it didnt stop us from enjoying the nice warm weather. We didnt bother with the entertainment at night, we just sat in the bar as they had everything that you could need ... free beer and cocktails!!

The staff was great (make sure you see Fransisco at the bar and participate in Jordan's merengue lessons)!!! There is a variety of things to do during the day, but everything shuts down fairly early.

Our room wasn't ready when we got there. The manager (Gregorio) didn't seem to care. When it got cleaned we actually went into the room (2 hours later) there was mold all over the ceiling of the room. When I went and told Gregorio he told me to come back the following day at 10am to switch rooms. The funny thing is that he wasn't there and the person there (Sandra) didn't want anything to do with us. The beaches and pool were very nice but the customer service was horrible.

The pool was lovely the hotel was gorgeous and very scenic although it was not a 5 star it was pretty and more than comfortable and looks great in our photos!! The Sirenis was better than we ever hoped for. After reading some bad reviews we were curious. There is no way it is a bad hotel so whatever negativity you read take it with a pinch of salt some people are never satisfied. If you can say you live amongst more beauty at home then you are very lucky. For what you pay to go here there is no way you can complain about the food you will NOT starve!!!, the food is satisfactory and sometimes it was very pleasant there is a load of choice and available 24 hrs. If you go on holiday just to EAT then dont chose this resort.!!!! If you go on holiday to enjoy the beach the pool the beautiful scenery and relax then definately go to this resort . The all inclusive deal is good value for money and there is alot of choice the staff are friendly but dont speak much english. The entertainment is somewhat tacky but I can see how the kids and families would enjoy it. Bare in mind most of the entertainment is in Spanish and if people miming songs from grease is your idea of great entertainment then you will have a ball. For couples and families who want to get away from it all this resort is perfect. For groups of friends looking for fun its not so good its not a party island and the only people to flirt with will be the waiting staff!! Me and my boyfriend found it very romantic and great for couples. Just remember one thing this country is sooo expensive you pay $3 for a can of coke at the airport!! they rip you off at the airport charging you for luggage on the way home!! and trying to buy gifts in the hotel is a waste of time as they are too expensive So if you dont enjoy the \"all inclusive\" experience go elsewhere.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 8, 2004", "id": 2283539}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great resort!!!", "text": "After booking this resort, my boyfriend and I visited tripadvisor to read some reviews.

The waiters immediatly fetch chilled water to your table and take your drinks order and your plates are never left empty infront of you for long.

I mentioned the holiday was fantastic for the first week only due to Hurricane Jeanne, which was no fault of the hotel, that is an issue i have with My Travel but i will say this; some of the hotel staff lost their homes and while all the guests were sat down moping about going home they were all keeping us entertained at all hours of the day; now if that isn't customer service for you then i dont know what is!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 4, 2004", "id": 2618540}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "MY WONDERFUL TRIP TO SIRENISSSS", "text": "A Year ago today,September 17........ I was in Sirenis Cocotal Beach R. for 2 weeks. The food was great,but sometimes repeated. There's 2 buffets,they're the same.Just one is on the Cocotal side and the other is on the Tropical Suites.The buffets would fix up beautiful shapes,animals with fruits.Very nicely done. Everyone that worked there were just ALWAYS happy,ALWAYS smiling,and ALWAYS with an 'Hola!'.Everyone was just very friendly,kind and helpful.Ofcourse, they didnt' speak very much english,but they tried.ALTHOUGH WE ARE THE TOURSITS IN THEIR COUNTRY,WE SHOULD TRY TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE! But they spoke alot of languages,like German,Dutch,Italian and many more. The animation team was GREAT! They're also very friendly and always trying for you to come and play games with them! Few animators were Carmen[Electra] {they match up their First names with a Celebrity Last name},Marcos [Polo],Ricky [Martin],Robert,Roberto Anthony,Jesus,Naomi [Campbell],Manuel,Jos\u00e9 Manuel,Angelika & Mimi[with the KIDS CLUB],Condolito,Gonzalo,Denise,Alexandra,Elvy,Gernando and SO MANY MORE.I just love them all. I had a blast with them.They are all VERY GOOD LOOKING ! ! ! They flirted so much! WOW! LOL. They worked very hard for the shows at night,and some of them didn't even have time to rehearse the shows.Everyone at the resort was up just SUPER early,and were in a good mood,or pertended to be.LOL.Although sometimes the shows were very 'Amataurish'[Stupid].Few nights,the shows were Dancing,CATS broadway show,Micheal Jackson Show[Very Well Done!],the shows were alot with the audience,and many more.Watching them rehearse in the daytime is also fun to watch,but it spoils the fun for the night,although they change it up alot for the night and add things. A few games, and lessons they had were,Spanish Lessons,Archary & Shooting[which they took you away,out of the Hotel],Aerobics in the pool and on the beach,pool games,Ice Breakers[games before the shows start at the Show{hut}],theres a Disco[not that great,lol.],and many other games. It didn't rain at all,except for 2-3 times,and it didn't last long at all.It would lightning at thunder and rain hard,but it would last for about 15-30 mins,then it was clear to start TANNIN AGAIN! It's hot,yes,but there is always a breeze which was GREATT ! The water in the ocean,was beautiful,really. The resort is huge,and beautiful.Also for the Lobby.I was in the block J. Each block had 2-3 floors,and the ones with 3 had elevators.I was on the Beach View. The rooms were very nice,also for the bathrooms.With Granite tops. At Night,WARNING, BRING BUG SPRAY !! The mosquitos,are literally out to get you! The hotel song,is wonderful. It was my first resort when they had a very nice song.It can be found on the Sirenis.Com site. Remember,for the days you are there,all you will hear will be; PROBLEMO PROBLEMO[Tourista],CATASROPHICO,CLAPPI CLAPPI,DRINKI DRINKI,NON RUMPI BUMBI, song ''YOU FEEL IT YOU FEEL IT ITS BURNING ITS BURNING HERE WE GO NOW HERE WE GO NOW CON LA PALMA CON LA PALMA I LOVE MY JOB !'',I Love My Job. ITS A GREAT PLACE. I REALLY WANT TO GO BACK. I LOVED IT. WORDS CANT EVEN DESCRIBE RIGHT NOW. I TRULLY MISS SIRENIS.

This resort was nothing like we expected. We read several reviews after we had already booked our reservations some good and some bad but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and not cancel. Looking back I wish we had at least changed resorts before traveling to the Dominican Republic. The Island was very beautiful, crystal clear water, great weather and that's about it. We are avid travelers and have always enjoyed each adventure except for this one. It started out really great - we met some fun people at the airport (staying at a different resort of course - The Paradisus - they said it was \"Awesome\") anyway we made it to Punta Cana airport and easily made it through and received our luggage very quickly, we were impressed. We found the bus that would shuttle us to our hotel and were greeted with a warm welcome by a couple of young men working for the agency we booked with. So far so good... the bus ride to the resort was not the best but the gentlemen made it fun, they were very friendly and spoke broken English but good enough to understand. They told us our hotel was far out and that it would take over an hour so if we wanted they would stop along the way for beer, rum or bathroom breaks. This was great because we were in the mood to start our vacation; we stopped for beer and then another stop for rum (Mamajuana) - make sure you ask about this rum to find out the story behind it. Anyway after two shots of Rum we loaded back on our bus and eventually made it to our resort. I didn't notice the potholes or the driving since I was feeling pretty good, (wish I had drank the rum on the trip back to the airport). Finally we pulled up to the Resort, it was very nice, beautiful landscaping, well kept grounds, and we were ready to relax. We get checked in, \"we had upgraded to an Ocean View room\" when they told us which bldg we were in they began to laugh. I know why now because it was in T close to the beach but so far away from everything and there was no other transportation other than your feet at this resort. Oh well no problem because I like being close to the beach. We get to our room and open the door to find a mess. Our room wasn't clean - no big deal, the maid was right there and she said she would clean immediately. We left our luggage and were starving so walked around looking for some food. Only one snack place was open at this time - 3:00 pm. It looked like it had been left out since noon. I ate french fries. Okay not the way I wanted to start out - finally 1 hr later our room was clean but with no bed covers or wash cloths. Finally got those and rested. It just got worse from there our room was cleaned everyday by the same maid and she wasn't very good, nice but not good. It was never done at the same time, it seemed as if anytime we were ready to get out of the sun - she was in the room. One day no toilet paper was left (which we definitely needed) and towels she used to clean were left in our room, along with trash. She never refilled our refrigerator. It became very annoying. The worst thing had to be the food and customer service - I ate bread and french fries most of the time because that was the only thing that my taste buds would allow me to keep down. However one night we went to The Gourmet restaurant. You have to pay $20 US dollars each to eat there - we thought, it should be good. We were wrong, it was the worst meal we had. One night was included in our upgrade so luckily we did not have to pay for it. Our glasses always sat empty at least 5 minutes before we finally were able to flag someone down for a refill. It was like this at all the reservation only restaurants. The Mediterranean and Italian Restaurant had the best food we thought but still with poor service. Half way into our trip we wanted to leave but stuck it out. This will be a vacation I will forget as soon as I finish this review along with a letter to our travel agency. If you want to go to a resort with nothing to do but sit at the pool or beach all day with minimal water activities than this resort it great but don't expect any shopping or site seeing unless you want to spend all day on a bus. One day a lot of time was spent in the bathroom so take some Imodium AD or Pepto and I didn't drank any water or did I brush my teeth in it so not for sure what happened.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 27, 2004", "id": 2497773}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "good 4 a week.

Another couple that arrived and leaving the same time as us were sick and this ride was making it worse. They too had a bad time and were really upset. All in all I will never return to this resort, maybe one day we will get back to the DR but probably not.
