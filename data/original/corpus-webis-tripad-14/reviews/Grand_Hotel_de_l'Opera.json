The hotel stated that you could not go into your room until 2pm, although the porter took us up straight away. Lovely room. We then went to ask about lunch as I was very hungray having driven from Dept 47 for 2 hours and another 40 minutes around Toulouse. The receptionist informed us that the Lunch Restaurant had closed but the Brasserie was open. We came down from the room within 5 minutes of arrival and went to the Brasserie only to be informed it was now closed!!! What an awful way to treat guests who have just arrived. We then had a disgusting meal in some cafe as that was all that was open. On returning to the hotel at about 3.30pm. I asked if I could order a plate of sandwich (room service) and informed that no food could be served until dinner only a hot drink!! We then asked about taxis to which the receptionist (porter) said it would be 20 minutes. Having gone outside and walked round the square we found a taxi rank actually right outside the hote!!! We went and saw the faboulous Kylie in concert and returned to the hotel at 11.30pm. We went to the bar to get a drink to be told by the PORTER (no staff) that it was closed and we could not get a drink at all. Disgraceful. The service of this hotel was apalling!! Will not stay there again, and would not recommend it to any of my friends or family. Very expensive, hotel decor lovely. Service disgusting!

This is a property where the customer is always right, my room was enormous and so beautiful in typical French style, overlooking a courtyard with a beautiful marble bath.
