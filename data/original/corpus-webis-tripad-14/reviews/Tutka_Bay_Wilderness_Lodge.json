I am a picky traveler when it comes to hotels and I couldn't find ANYTHING to fault. The proprietors make you feel like you're a guest in their home. Nelda is a superb cook and uses a lot of local, fresh fish. If you love salmon and halibut, this is your place! It's true that the small peninsula on which the lodge sits can be confining for avid hikers. We did some guided kayaking (for which there is an additional charge) and we got dropped across the bay so we could hike in the state park (for which there is NOT an additional charge). The lodge is expensive but, considering the quality of both the lodging and the meals, worth every penny.", "title": "the best!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jbullock47", "date": "August 11, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3755930}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Blissful, relaxing", "text": "We ended a two week trip in Alaska with 3 nights of heaven at Tutka Bay. The cabins are fantastic and the owners are wonderful. You feel like you truly get away from it all. The setting is stunningly beautiful - sitting in the hot tub overlooking Tutka Bay is bliss. The food was also to die for. The only downside is that you are somewhat confined to a relatively small area -- there is a wonderful 30 minute hike around the grounds on which we saw many bald eagles, but that is the only place you can walk. Otherwise we took a fantastic kayaking excursion one day. You need to be willing to either just completely relax on the amazing deck and take small walks or do some of the paid excursions.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 18, 2005", "id": 3285760}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Wonderful wilderness lodge across the bay from \"civilization\".(no roads=no cars) Comfortable rustic cabins, delicious gourmet food, and a hostess/owner who is dedicated to provide you with a wonderful Alaska experience.", "title": "Paradise in the Wilderness", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "SophiaNY", "date": "July 30, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2346081}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Homer"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 2, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 19}, "aka": "Tutka Bay Wilderness Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.346153846154}
