The hotel is modern with a beautiful lobby that opens unto a very nice restaurant that has outdoor seating. The delicious breakfast is served in the atrium set in an enclosed courtyard. The AP is within walking distance from Alexanderplatz and the historic district of Hackescher H\u00f6fe. Our hotel room looked directly across at the Hackescher Markt, with its many outdoor restaurants as well as shops, bars and nightclubs. One block from the tram and subway, it is an ideal location to explore Berlin.", "user": "Elleboogie", "date": "August 2, 2003", "id": 1189215}], "location": {}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 33, "very good": 121, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 85}, "aka": "Alexander Plaza Berlin Hotel Berlin", "slim_ranking": 0.209895052474, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}}
