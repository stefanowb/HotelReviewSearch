The welcome was warm and the rooms were beautiful in a slightly shabby, chateau way. The hostess moved my parents to a more beautiful room without asking although the original room was very nice. The electrics in the bedroom were unusual and probably wouldn't pass UK health and safety standards. We had a roll top bath in a marble effect bathroom with an ultra modern \"Saniflow\" type toilet.", "title": "Amazing Experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "S_G_Taylor", "date": "August 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 38759765}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Franche-Comte", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
