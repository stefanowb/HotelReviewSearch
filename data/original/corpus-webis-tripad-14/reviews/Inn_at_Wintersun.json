I found the place on bbonline a couple years ago, and I knew right away I wanted to experience the Wintersun Suite, but it wasn't until just recently that the opportunity presented itself. (We were going to be in the Asheville area anyway on some other family business, and I figured we could afford the steep tab for the Suite if it was only going to be for the couple of nights we were going to be there.)", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "afrinl", "date": "June 20, 2005", "id": 3578457}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2005", "text": "If there's one thing that needs to be said about The Inn at Wintersun, it's that their website (neither their listing on bbonline nor their own website) doesn't even *begin* to do the place justice. You have to see this place to believe it, because the text and few photos available on the web completely fail to convey the magic that's here. Words simply cannot adequately convey how exquisitely lovely -- and extraordinarily well maintained -- this property is (including both the acres and acres of grounds and the inn itself). If the owners want to increase occupancy to 100%, they simply need a better website that more convincingly demonstrates that guests absolutely will get their money's worth.", "title": "If you want privacy...this is the place.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "CindynGA", "date": "July 1, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 2249107}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fabulous", "text": "A word, too, about the interior decoration: I'm a guy and thus not ordinarily attuned to the finer points of interior decoration (as long as the structural timbers are covered with sheetrock, I'm happy), but I have to say, the interior decoration of the Inn is nothing short of magnificent.
