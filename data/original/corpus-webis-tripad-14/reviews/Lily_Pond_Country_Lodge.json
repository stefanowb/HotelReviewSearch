These are really spacious, with a divider between the bedroom/sitting area and large bathroom, which also has an outside shower. The bed was king size with oversized pillows, although more conventional pillows are available. No air-con is provided although there is a ceiling fan which just about stops nights from becoming too stuffy. The garden suites suffer a bit in terms of privacy from having a path in front of them and sounds from the next door suite are rather too audible at times.

I think for the price they should have options and if not then they should inform you ahead of time so they can do a proper replacement for the more picky eater.

I must say that, compared to other similar places we have stayed at within our South Africa Trip, the dedication of the hosts to the guests is just not that warm. The hosts leave you the feeling that they like to draw a line between themselves and the guests. And we had one very dissatisfying experience, where we asked to be seated at the fireplace for dinner in the morning, and ended up to be placed near a windy door instead, while the owners with some friends were sitting at the fireplace.
