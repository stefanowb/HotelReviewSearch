The grounds and public spaces are more luxe here than at other Marriott timeshare properties but the units themselves are smaller. Ours has a slice of ocean view but was rather dark. There isn't beach access and you will find most guests at the pool area so the pool is always crowded--that's the only place to be. The pool bar is the only restaurant and the wait for a burger was over half an hour which we thought pretty unacceptable. I wouldn't really call it a restaurant--it is just a snack bar where you place an order and then wait forever until they call your number and you pick up your styrofoam box. It's a big place and right now there isn't the infrastructure to support the number of guests they have. Lots of kids, long lines at the pool grill, delays for food, etc. Beds are very thin sheets and mattresses. We were told Marriott plans to upgrade them to their hotel standard \"Revival\" bedding. They should because they come across as cheap motel type beds. We are Marriott Vacation Club owners at another location and had a strange feeling at this property. There was a luxe facade upon entering, but the rooms are smaller than other properties and the services are not up to par. Combined with the high occupancy and the crowded public spaces like the pool area, and no place else to spread out, it just didn't feel right. You end up telling yourself you should just pay more and go elsewhere and get better service and services. It's no deal unless you go for the cheap come-on they give to try to get you to buy a unit--have very low expectations and then maybe you won't be disappointed! Careful though, the salespeople here are some of the most high-pressure ones we have ever seen. We have been impressed with Marriott in the past in that they usually are knowledgeable, especially when addressing people who already own and who they want to interest in purchasing additional weeks--they are low pressure but here they use tricks like \"buy now or this offer is coming off the table\" while they sweep what they have written down off the table, literally! Don't buy it--take your time and think it over.", "title": "Expensive Coastal Real Estate, but lacks amenities", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "topromer", "date": "August 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5600712, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 VIews from the lobby, pool", "disliked": "\u2014 Cheap motel-type beds, bad service at one and only restaurant which was a snack bar"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We just got back from a two week California vacation.

I paid $40 for one partial cleaning with sheets changed out. I'm used to daily maid service at my condo.

We specifically picked this time as we hoped all the kids would be in school. Another couple were to join us but backed out so we ended up with 2 large bedrooms, kitchen, dining area, living room etc. all to ourselves. Our was in the 1600 block (its a huge overall facility) which overlooked a golf course (not Marriotts). While I new we had others all around us we never heard any sounds (no toilets flushing, doors slamming showers running - it was the quietest place I ever stayed in. Unlike what others may have experienced I found everything 100% immaculate. But I would agree that the tiles are loose and cracking in the kitchen & bathrooms (I've already mentioned it to management). I also noticed it took a long time to get hot water out of the showers but once it flowed there was plenty. These two are minor complaints. We didn't use any services except the pool and coffee shop which were both fine. It was a timeshare swap so we did not have room service each day but it was available for an extra fee. Management should have mentioned that they have a deal with the supermarket up the street (Pavilion) where by mentioning Marriott you can get all the discounts of a regular shopper (my wife found out by asking at the Pavilion Service desk). Also know the state park is across the street and follows the ocean so its only 10 minutes to the beach. But is a nice leisurely walk but I would not do it with beach chairs etc. You can drive down and park there for $10/day (marriott front desk has a 1st come 1st served pass). But even the park is 100 feet up on a bluff over the beach so you need to walk quiet a way even from the parking lot. Also know that the quickes way to the hotel using highways is to connect to Route 73 (toll road). It may cost you $4.00 but it has a direct exit to Newport Coast Drive which for some reason doesn't show up on many maps (which is odd as it's a huge road). We went off-season for the beaches so the water was too cold to swim and anyone in the water had wetsuites on. But It is a beach community and must be VERY busy when things warm up. It is also a good place to see things but like everything in CA there is a lot of driving (we put on 1,000 miles!) to get most places- but the signage is great!

We stayed in unit 2520, which was an end unit. It had a nice view of the ocean and it was quiet. I would mention that the unit has no immediate parking, so we parked near another building and walked. No big deal for us, but for anyone with an ambulatory problem it could be an issue. For that matter, being located on the side of a hill like it is, the whole NCV complex would be difficult for anyone who does not do stairs very well. Complex is close to Newport Beaches. We went to Corona Del Mar Beach, which was very nice. I will note for others that the bathrooms at this beach are being renovated, and there was no sign directing one to the portables tucked around back. We did not see them until we were leaving the beach for the day.
