Our favorite, Hallet, has the most comfortable bed anywhere. We miss you both, and Bailey and Conrad already!

I chose the Liberty Hill Inn because it seemed centrally convenient to the whole Cape. At least I was right on one count. The Inn was conveniently located for the entire Cape. While the weather was not what I was hoping for, the Inn was great! The room was far better than the pictures showed. The Innkeepers were very gracious and accomodating with requests. Breakfasts (the mornings I got out of the featherbed) were delicious and well-balanced. Even when I chose not to eat breakfast in the Main House, there was always fresh fruit and water by the bedside. I was close enough to everything but still away from all the hectic traffic on the southern side of the Cape. I will definitely recommend Liberty Hill Inn to friends and family. I'll also plan on staying there when I go back to visit Martha's Vineyard.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "mojoe1", "date": "October 18, 2005", "id": 4031319}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved Liberty Hill Inn", "text": "We were looking forward to a nice. relaxing 3 days away from the grind, at a place that was clean, quaint, quiet, had good food, and was close to everything. Liberty Hill Inn was that and more! We saw so much of the Cape in those three days, yet never felt rushed or tired. The rooms were remarkable, and included warm, rich furniture, a great fireplace, and a clean and roomy bath. The main house, where breakfast and snacks were served, was equally incredible. Kris knocked our socks off with great breakfasts that kept us satisfied for most of the day. And John and Kris both made fantastic restaurant recommendations at places within 5 minutes from the Inn. If I ever travel back to the Cape, I will definitely stay at Liberty Hill Inn again.

From the moment you walk into the inviting, comfortable parlor, you can tell this is a place of welcome. We were in the Eldridge room in the Carriage House, which while newer, was well-decorated with antiques and a comfortable canopied bed. Plus it had a nice double whirlpool bath. Little touches such as a refrigerator right outside the room added to our enjoyment. But one of the best parts of the stay was the hospitality of John & Kris. Always ready to please you, they make you feel welcome with a smile. They are interesting conversationalists and consummate hosts. Friendly bassett hounds add a homey touch.
