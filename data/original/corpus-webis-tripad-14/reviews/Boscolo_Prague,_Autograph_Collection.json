I chose the Boscolo because the room rate was considerably less than the Prague Marriott Hotel. Also, the hotel photos showed the Boscolo to have an old world European look which I thought was charming. The room we were shown to was fine, had all the amenities of a good hotel BUT the room looked out on a massive white wall which they tried to camouflage by installing a plexiglas screen with green leaves painted on it. I was terribly disappointed by the horrid view..here I was in beautiful Prague and I looked out my hotel window at white roofing. I could barely see the sky. I was so disappointed in the room view that we decided to upgrade our accomodation. This upgrade resulted in adding 40 Eur to our room charge. The hotel staff was very understanding and helpful in relocating us. My recommendation is that if you choose the Boscolo do not choose the lowest price room unless you are fine with a really bad view. I repeat, the room was quiet nice. The location of the hotel was not the best. Our travel companions stayed at the Old Town Hilton. The location of that hotel was far better than the Boscolo. We walked the few blocks from the Boscolo to the Hilton (which is directly across the street from the Prague Marriott Hotel) a couple times a day. I felt as if I were walking into a step down in neighborhood as I headed to the Boscolo from the Hilton location. We encountered a problem with the water to the bathtub. When I ran a bath the water was yellow/rust color. I reported the problem immediately and was promised repair. The problem was never fixed and persisted throughout our three day stay. When I complained about the water problem upon check out we were given a small reduction on our room rate.
