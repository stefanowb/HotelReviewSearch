I travelled with my boyfriend and parents, away for a long weekend for my parents birthdays so hoped that everyone would be happy with my choice of accommodation. It's a family run hotel with an extremely warm welcome and the staff were all very freindly and helpful, full of tips on the best bits of Skye to see before we headed off the island. The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, tasty breakfasts and good value meals in the bar. Located off the main square, right in the heart of Portree, it's a great location for exploring the town & the island.", "title": "Great place with friendly, helpful staff", "user": "kerryl0u", "date": "July 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 35035988}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The seal of approval came from my mum, who is a little bit hard to please, who loved the place and will probably recommend it to everyone she speaks to! :)", "title": "Would not return", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Arisaig_9", "date": "July 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 34541049}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Booked for one night based on tripadvisor reviews.

Reception is on the second floor up two narrow flights of stairs, although there is direct access to this floor from the car park at the back. On the ground floor is a super little cafe (the food is much better than average cafe fare) and a basic, modern bar is on the floor above.
