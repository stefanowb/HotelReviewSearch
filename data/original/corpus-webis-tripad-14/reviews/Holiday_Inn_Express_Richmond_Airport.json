We got a great rate on hotwire for a two-queen room. Easy to find off the interstate. We arrived past midnight and was able to quickly get to our room to sleep for the night. Room insulation good and was very quiet. Bathroom was standard and clean, although the toilet flushed weakly. we spotted a pool and small fitness room but did not use. The next morning, we made it down to breakfast and was impressed by the spread. Self serve hot options included bacon, eggs, biscuits and gravy, as well as an on-demand pancake maker. Fruit, yogurt, and cereals also available. Overall, this was a good value.
