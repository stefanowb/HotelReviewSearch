I had reserved a city view king room using my rewards points and the room type was guaranteed . The front desk person said that only doubles were available as the hotel was completely sold out. I told her a king room would only work as we had 2 little ones and they would be sleeping in cribs. After spending about 5 minutes working on the computer and making some calls she informed me they did have a nice king room available in the south tower overlooking the pool and bay. She also gave me 2 gift bags for the boys that contained little toys and trinkets. A very nice gesture on her part. In the end we ended up with a nicer room then what I had booked with awesome views. My oldest son was so excited when we saw the room for the first time he kept jumping up and down. He especially enjoyed seeing the boats and trains go by. The room was clean and well maintained.
