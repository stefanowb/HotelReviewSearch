As we walked in, a vagrant asked us for bus money. We then arrived to a front desk attendant who kept walking away while we were trying to ask questions. No welcome. No smile. An extra blanket was pulled out, wadded up and thrown on the lobby couch for some poor requestee. The lobby was ok but the floor we were on smelled and the room smelled even worse. I don't know if it was smoke or what. After I cleaned some mysterious stains off the bathroom sink and walls myself, I then had to go to the front desk and ask for some shampoo b/c there was none in the room. The next morning, the waffle lady complained about having to make waffles, get plates, clean tables and whatever else she was required to do. If you asked for a waffle at the wrong moment -- you heard about it! I also heard it from the housekeeping staff person for our floor when I asked for a few more minutes to get out of the room. How dare I? Apparently they \"clean\" (and I use that term loosely) the rooms when THEY are ready, not when we are. I could go on but I will suffice it to say that I was happy to leave.
