Really, the whole street was awesome. Music and laughter and food and shisha. Everyone from all the hostels and restaurants seemed to know each other so they just hung out with each other and with the patrons. It was a great place to just relax and enjoy your vacation. The breakfast was filling (breads and jam, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, olives, coffee, and tea). And the hostel's restaurant wasn't half bad either.
