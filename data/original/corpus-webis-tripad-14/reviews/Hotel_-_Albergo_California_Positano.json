We had never been to the Amalfi Coast before and we were a little anxious as to how gay friendly Positano was. We needn't have worried as we experienced nothing but an amazingly warm welcome from Maria and her lovely family who own and run Alberto California. When we requested an ironing service for our wedding shirts, although this service is not normally offered to guests, Maria went out of her way to have ths done. Excellent! and greatly appreciated!
