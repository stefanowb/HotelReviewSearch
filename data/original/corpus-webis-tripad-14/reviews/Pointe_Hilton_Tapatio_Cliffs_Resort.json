For the same price per night, you cannot even compare the hotels. First, we arrived early on a Thursday and were informed that our room would not be ready until 4 pm. We basically wasted the first day of our trip (and the best weather day) waiting in the lobby for our room to be ready, even though we were told it would be ready by noon. The front desk staff was rude and sarcastic, which made matters worse. I have never had that problem at a Hilton. While we were waiting, we ate at the outdoor cafe, Cascades, and the food was horrible--stay away from the fish tacos which were merely fried pieces of crunchy batter. The rooms need to be updated and they were pretty drab--old couches and furniture--nothing fancy. The bed, however, was comfortable. The housecleaning servce leaves a lot to be desired. Finally, there is nothing to do at the hotel and they are pretty stingy with any kind of shuttle service. We rented a car for the day just to get off the grounds. On the plus side, there are pools and spas all over which are nice, although most of the lounge chairs are uncomfortable and do not have cushions. They also pass out regular, scratchy, non absorbent towels and not plush beach towels at the pool. There is an exercise room which is average-a few machines. The Point In Thyme restaurant was nice and room service was good. We did not eat at the Mexican restaurant. The Spa was nice and the body wrap was a nice experience but the Spa was definitely average and the place and the rooms were small. The view from our room was really pretty, we stayed in building 8 on the second floor and we overlooked the Falls village. We actually did not mind the walk around the resort but a resort shuttle is available. I am not a spoiled princess by any means but for the price we payed, 279.00/night, I definitely expected more luxury. I stayed at a Hilton in New Orleans, post Katrina, for 99$ a night and had more comfort. We also recently stayed at a Hilton in San Francisco for $119 a night and had a lot more luxury and comfort. The reviews on this hotel are mixed and I can see why and I am generally easy to please. I would not stay at this Hilton again, I also have a friend that stayed and felt the same way.

Didn't know what to expect after reading previous reviews. The good news was that the bed was extremely comfortable (nice linens, mattress similar in feel to comfy beds at W Hotels) and the room was probably one of the quietest hotel rooms I've stayed in (maybe we lucked out with quiet neighbors). When checking in, we did request that our room be in a quiet section of the property and we upgraded to a room with a view -- we were in the cliffside area above the Sunset Pool. Room was spacious, OK decor, but it's obvious that the property was built in the 1970s since bathtub, toilet, etc are all of a rather dated vintage. Our suite had open beam cathedral ceilings, which was nice, so I recommend requesting an upper unit. The downside: The resort seems very tired and dated, elevators run very slowly, everything seems a little bit patched together and in need of paint or a good makeover or remodel (I did notice those painted floor tiles in the lobby that someone mentioned, though I didn't think they looked that bad). Service in the restaurant by the pro shop was slow and food was substandard. Fish tacos at Mexican place were OK. Since hotel is built on a hillside, there's lots of walking involved if you are in an upper unit, but we didn't mind that at all -- a five-minute walk seemed better than being housed in one of the dreary units near the lobby that overlooked the parking lot. Another point (or \"pointe\") to consider: Location of the hotel is not the best for accessing tourist venues (spring training, Scottsdale, etc. ). Overall, the property is dated, but our unit (at least) offered quiet, a comfy bed and a view (albeit of suburban sprawl and hills way beyond).
