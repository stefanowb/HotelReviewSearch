Babu saw us and came out to the taxi and said that he had a very nice room with A/C, and the other place did not (which was true). Initially, I was skeptical, but I was tired and we went with Palm Tree Heritage. Babu said that we could have the larger room for two nights, and if we wanted to stay longer, we'd have to move since it was already reserved. Being tired from the road, I agreed and was not disappointed. The first two nights was in one of the deluxe rooms. It was larger with large bathroom, cold A/C and big balcony. These rooms do not seem to be affected by the 30 minute rolling blackout every evening at 7 or 7:30PM. The only downside was that the bed is a little lumpy. Breakfast was included in the rate and it was very tasty. I loved the location. The hotel is actually in Odayam Beach, which is one beach down from Varkala (10 minute walk to the action in Varkala). The two nice things about this are, you can walk out from your hotel room and go right into the ocean. The beach is small, but it is there, very close and easily accessible. The currents can get strong so you have to pay attention in the water. Varkala beach is at the bottom of the cliffs, so no hotels that I saw in Varkala proper had easy beach access. The second nice thing is that Odayam Beach is more peaceful / quiet. My friend who I was traveling with liked to be in the middle of the action, while I liked being slightly removed from it. Again, it's not far from the action in Varkala, but it is not in the middle of all of the hub-bub, so this is really personal preference. I thought the location was the best of both worlds. We had such a good time here that we added, one night, then another, and then one more. For the last 3 nights, we were in the other building (which costs less), which is a short walk (2 or 3 minutes) from where the restaurant and beach are located. These rooms were smaller, with small bathrooms, but they were clean and comfortable (the A/C blew cold). For me, these rooms would have been fine for the entire trip, as I only went to the room to sleep and didn't need the extra room of the larger rooms. The food in the restaurant was good and the service was efficient. My initial impression was that I was skeptical of the hotel and staff since we were \"steered\" away from our original hotel. We couldn't find it, and Babu said that they didn't have A/C (which is true) and that we would want A/C (which we did as a storm rolled through our last night and we lost power and it got hot). Babu was right and I ended up really liking the hotel. I thought the beds in this building were better than in the more expensive room. Overall, the price was reasonable, although higher than what I would have paid at the other place. However, the need for A/C more than made up for the slightly higher cost. This hotel was not in my Lonely Planet, so I hope it gets added.", "title": "Just wonderful", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Kate21a", "date": "April 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129022225}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Having intended to stay elsewhere, we were swayed by Palm Tree Heritage because of the offer of air conditioning in the rooms.

Reading the reviews this seems to be a consistent story with others, and is complicated by the fact that there is the annexe that needs filling.
