I traveled with two girl friends and we stayed on the 3rd floor building 12..across from the 'Relax' pool. The location , our room and housekeeping was good. Could of used a colder refrigerator and more bottled water, but that's it for complaints.....really nothing we couldn't live with. The resort is beautiful , the maintance staff always puttering around fixing, painting, landscaping. They are great to stop a chat as your walking around....I found all the staff there equally as friendly. The bar staff around the pool were talented and fun...
