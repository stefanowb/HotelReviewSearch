However, when I arrived at the hotel, the front desk indicated that there are no AAA or government discounts for weekends. I regret not getting out of line and pulling out my laptop to book my stay online. Oh well. 3) The front desk didn't bother giving me the service bar key. When I remembered and called the front desk, he made up all these excuses. First, they ran out of service bar keys and would call one he found one. Then he claimed that someone stole all the keys. The next morning, I went to the front desk again, and the lady that was there had no trouble finding a key for me. 4) The room looked nice and clean, but the bathroom door would not close. 5) Walls are paper thin.

The beds were comfortable but small, definitely not two queens, more like two doubles. The view from the fifteenth floor was amazing, we could see the downtown skyline every morning upon waking. The pool, saltwater, was heated and large. The jacuzzi was adequate but there were no controls to activate the bubblers. The bar was extremely small and ridiculously overpriced, my wife and I paid over $11.00 for two bottles of Budweiser!! We did not eat at the hotel restaurant but the menu looked very expensive. The t.v. was not huge but did offer plenty of channel options. The bathroom was a good size and had nice bath products for use. The mini bar was stocked but we did not utilize as we had our own drinks. The parking garage was adequate but you did have to catch a separate elevator to get to and from.
