Room prices at the MAC beat anything in our desired downtown location. Rooms (regular) were *very* spacious -- almost suites and we had two connecting rooms which made our 2 rooms into a very , very, arge suite. The rooms came with full guest priviledges at the athletic center (lap pool, well endowed weight/machine room, basketball court) which we used quite heartily -- our teenagers especially. The athletic center had lockers, showers, sauna as well. We walked to everything that we had planned -- the riverfront, restaurants, outdoor ice skating. The location was extremely convenient for us and even very quiet. There is a fire station right next door, but we only heard the firetrucks one time, and even this was not loud. There is a bar/restaurant on premises, which we did not visit, choosing other more respected choices (a good German restaurant called Karl Rautsches is next door). There is a review about the walls of the hotel being thin (not sound-proofed) -- we did not experience this.", "title": "A nice choice-and free use of athletic club", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "2Midwest", "date": "October 29, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 85315567}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here last Saturday,Jan.7th..The room was big,and,beautiful!The shower worked perfectly,and,the staff was awesome...", "title": "Milwaukee athletic club magical", "user": "charliejoe", "date": "January 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122998570}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled on business", "text": "We had dinner in the \"Elephant room\"..I had bone in Rib eye,and, my wife enjoyed the Halibut..Both were delicious...A great place...", "title": "Nice staff - hotel is really, really not nice", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MN_PAUL", "date": "December 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121962686}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "My experience started after a long day at work when I finally arrived at the hotel.
