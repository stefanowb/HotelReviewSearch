The poor service started when having been driven by our taxi driver to the Langham Place instead of the Langham through no fault of our own, as we told the driver several times which Langham we were staying at, the Langham place did nothing to assist. It would have been nice to have offered a hotel car to drive us to the correct hotel, only a 5 to 10 minute ride.

Now while the Langham doesn't look that much from the outside once you step aside the beautiful aroma (white ginger???) instantly makes you feel relaxed. We arrived at stupid time in the morning but were checked in straight away. The lovely man who checked us in escorted us up to our room and gave us a complete run down of the room which was fab. I like this because, well, as I get older I'll be damned if I can find light switches in hotel rooms these days. I'll be lying in bed trying to turn off desk lamps, room lights, floor lamps, bathroom lights, hall lights and tracking them all down is like 20mins. So thank you my friend. Also hooked us up with wifi. I should say Club rooms, totally worth it for breakfast and cocktails. Up for a swim to help with jet lag and pleasantly surprised, a really beautiful area, so rare in HK. Now we didn't mention my husbands birthday to any of the staff, but one eagle eyed front desk person must have noticed on the passport becuase when we returned from our big night out, the most gorgeous cake and card was waiting for us. Who doesn't like cheesecake 2 int he morning! It was a really nice touch thank you. The location is excellent, for those who like jazz nearby is Ned Kellys Last Stand which has good jazz each night and yum cha freaks right near the hotel is probably the best soup dumpings weve ever eaten at the famous Din Tai Fung. The airport bus stops right outside front of the hotel. We've stayed in Auckland & Melbourne Langhams and I really enjoy these hotels for a step back in time, the good ole days of travel, everything is gilt in gold, service is friendly and not rushed, rooms aren't filled with techno gizmos, furniture is plush and comfy.

When we were deciding on where to stay, we both instantly wanted to stay at the Langham. We stayed here four years ago and we all loved it. From the moment we entered the lobby of the Langham, we could smell the distinct Langham Fragrance. The lobby is the same as we remembered with the beautiful decor, smell and the large bouquet of flowers in the centre. We arrived at the hotel earlier than expected and therefore our room was not ready. We were booked into the Grand Langham Room - however we were interested in upgrading to a club room so we could have access to the Club Lounge. We ended up upgrading ourselves to The Langham Club and our room was upgraded to the Langham Club Room free of charge. Although it was expensive to upgrade - it was well worth the cost. When staying in a Club Room, you get access to the Club Lounge which is located on the 11th Floor of the Hotel. The lounge is the perfect place to get away from the crowds in Hong Kong and also the perfect place to relax after a long day of shopping or sightseeing in Hong Kong. The best thing about having access to the Club Lounge is the complimentary drinks included in the package. You can have unlimited drinks which included champagne, spirits, beers and soft drinks. You also get to have afternoon tea up in the Lounge as many times as you want. There are also different foods up there from crisps too hot and cold snacks which included sandwiches, quiche, meats and pastries. As well as having afternoon tea in the Lounge, you can also have breakfast up there which I must say is better in the lounge than downstairs in L'ECLIPSE as it is less busy, more relaxing and the food is better as there is more choice. There is also a business centre in the Club Lounge which has computers and printers which meant we could check in online for our flight and print our boarding cards out. Now onto the Langham Club Room. This room was spacious with a lot of storage space for clothes and electronics. There are also a LOT of plugs for you to charge your phones, laptops and tablets. The beds and pillows were AMAZING - we had two beds in out room which were very big and very comfortable. We like rooms that have good blinds or curtains and this room definitely had those. The curtains were great as they were black out which meant it was completely dark in the room even though it was sunny and bright outside.The only thing about the Club Room which we were unsure of was they had apparently been renovated recently yet they did not look newly decorated. The pool located on the roof was lovely and quiet. It was great to go for a relaxing swim after a long day out and then sit down on one of the multiple loungers next the pool. The gym also looked great - perfect if you are a gym fanatic and like to keep fit while on holiday. Our overall experience of the Langham has been wonderful. It is a luxurious hotel but expensive. The Langham Club Lounge was fantastic and well worth the cost.
