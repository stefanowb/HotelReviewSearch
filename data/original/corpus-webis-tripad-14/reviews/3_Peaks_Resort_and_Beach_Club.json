This time I went the Lake Tahoe off season and went to the hotel without a reservation. I was pleasantly surprised with how friendly and helpful the front desk person was this time. We had to wait as several people arrived at the same time, but she politely asked us to wait. My girlfriend and I requested a room with jacuzzi tub and fire place. We were offered a \"Romance Suite\" for $89 (not including tax.) This room was pretty large with a nice wood fireplace in the bedroom, a small dining table, a small refrigerator, microwave, plates, cups and silverware, plus a dvd/cd player (does not play MP3 cd's) and surround sound stereo system. The heart shaped jacuzzi tub is in a separate room were it occupies most of the space, a small shower stall is in the corner. We found the amenities very convenient, especially if you are staying for several nights. I would hesitate to call this room a Romance suite though. In my opinion it takes more than a heart shaped tub to make a room romantic. The fireplace does not come with any firewood, you have to buy your own and I found this rather tacky as it is not very expensive to add a couple of logs. The shower is very small and would not normally accommodate two people. The water temperature will easily change when another person or room is running water, but we eventually always had hot water. The walls are a bit thin and on the first night we could hear the couple next door having sex. Luckily they left the next day. The switch for the jacuzzi is on one wall, the water controls are on another and you have to get out of the tub to operate. The floor in the bathroom is made of stone and can be cold in the mornings, it could use some floor rugs. The two wall heaters are not enough and I imagine it is cold in the winter. Overall the room is lacking personality (hunting and fishing props on walls, not romantic) , especially for a romance suite. We were very satisfied overall. We would definitely return, but would probably not want to pay much more than we did (in peak season, I think this room is around $300)", "title": "Very nice room and worth the rate I paid (off season)", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "travelSanFrancisco", "date": "April 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7389134, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Amenities in room, good for long stays", "disliked": "\u2014 Interior design, decorations"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Convenient for Families-but...", "text": "Everything that the hotel could control was great. We stayed at a suite and the kitchen was fully stocked and clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge. The kids loved both balconies and the proximity to the playground at the private beach. However, our second night was miserable. Our neighbors came home drunk around 2AM. They cussed and argued, perhaps with some local hookers. The night manager called them and we could hear all of the discussion. Perhaps it was a matter for the police, but we missed out on precious sleep for an early ski lesson. Maybe the hotel could have given us an apology, but those awful neighbors stayed another night. They even banged on our door by mistake. I was frightened. This area looks so nice but it is close to the casinos so who knows what kind of rif-raf lurk at night. Would I go back?
