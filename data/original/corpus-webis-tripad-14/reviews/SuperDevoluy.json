They were basic but for the amazing price we got them for absolutely fine. The apartment was meant to sleep 6 but there was only two of us there, I would say any more adults and it would have been a bit of a squeeze. The bedroom was tiny and had a double bed, then there was bunkbeds in the hallway and a sofa bed in the kitchen/living area. Our friends were in a 4 bed apartment which actually seemed more spacious as it had a room for the bunk beds, but even so at the prices we paid it was worth having our own space.", "title": "Basic Chalets but good location", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ash4985", "date": "April 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127115046}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The apartments weren't that clean when we arrived, we ended up mopping the floors and putting the cutlery through the dishwasher.

We were skiing towards the end of the season so some of the lower pistes were shut but they did a good job at maintaining those that were open and once you were up the first lift the snow was pretty good. Biggest recommendation would be to stop at a supermarket before you head into the mountains as the local supermarket was over priced.", "title": "Really enjoyed Resort - views and ski was amazing", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Mimistar1987", "date": "October 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119255066}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Superdevoluy Family Ski?", "text": "We stayed at the apartments Hameau du Puy. 6 adults and 2 children in an apartment that slept 8, one double being the sofa bed. The bunk bed room is TINY!!! We found the resort to be perfect for a family group with snowboarders, skiers and walkers in it - plenty of variety in slopes and mountain walks. One 4 year old (slightly timid) went to ski school and although everyone else was french she managed to survive and enjoy, the other 4 year old found ski school a bit pedestrian so moved to one on one lessons. Ski hire, walking raquettes all easy and not super expensive. Supermarket expensive but restaurants not bad at all. The swimming pool in our building was small but perfect.
