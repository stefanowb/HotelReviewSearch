Not that it was awful, it was not, but just not as pleasant as others. First the good, the rooms were HUGE by NYC standards and the bed was super comfy. The shower products were nice and the pressure in the shower was nice. Now the bad, our comforter(yes I know hotel comforters are gross, but this was more gross than normal) had a stain on it that looked like semen! Super gross. The blind fell off in the middle of the night and woke us up, and the street noise was awful. This may have been because we were on the 3rd floor, but it was hard to fall asleep and we were woken early by the hustle on the street. I will end on a positive. This is on 39th/Lexington and is in walking distance of many good places, so b/c of this, I may consider staying again if I were on a higher floor away from the street, but I would never pay full price. We booked through a discount travel sight, thankfully, as I would never pay $400 for a night in this hotel.", "title": "Great location, but that is where the good ends.", "user": "htram", "date": "June 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 67410449}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Loved the rooms, the atmosphere and the service (bell man, concierge, front desk, phone person were all very friendly).

We had a sizable room and a really nice view. While we weren't in NYC to spend time in the room, it was everything we needed, and it was within walking distance to anything we required. Other than a strange first impression, the only real hassle was presented at check out. Somehow the hotel charged my credit card FIVE times, plus the room deposit.

Taxi's to LaGuardia ($25 per car) and JFK ($50) are easily flagged at the front door.) The location is a perfect two minute walk from Grand Central and the 4/5/6 subway from there covers all the sights from Central Park and the Museums to the north, all the way through Soho to Wall Street and ground zero to the south. MoMA, Radio City, Times Square, the theater district are a short walk and the Chrysler Building or Empire State will be outside your bedroom window depending on which side of the building you're on. As for the tiniest details, I happen to like the Philosophy brand products they provide. Oddly, there is no coffee pot in the rooms but there are several Starbucks outlets in the immediate surrounding area. The free internet in room makes up for that.
