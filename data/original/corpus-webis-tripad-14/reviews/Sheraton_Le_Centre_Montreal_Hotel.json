They did offer to send an ionizer to my room, which did effectively nothing to the smell.

We drove from Albany NY on saturday 5/27 ( took over 3 hours at the border crossing), got to the hotel at around 7pm, parked in their underground parking lot for $18 CAD for over 36 hours of parking. Rue St Catherine was a couple of blocks away so was the entrance to the underground city. On Sunday we took the bus tour of Montreal for $18 CAD each which lasted about 3 hours and was worth every penny The Driver dropped us off at the Notre Dame Basillica, took $5 each to get in. From here we walked through Old Montreal and back to the hotel which was about a 15 to 20 minute walk. By the way the tour started at Rue Peel at Dorchester Sq which was also a couple of blocks from the hotel.", "title": "not a good value", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "WaverlySharon", "date": "April 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 5004237}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good not Great", "text": "We stayed at the Sheraton in Montreal for 3 nights.
