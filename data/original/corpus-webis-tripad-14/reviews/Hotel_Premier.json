I can only speak for our double-bed, non-smkg room (#518) - which was clean and cool. The shower obviously wasn't brand new, but everything else in the room seemed to work well. The indoor pool was fine too. The walk to/from the stadium was not bad at all - seeing as it was a gameday and there were people & police presence everywhere. I felt safe even on the walk back to the hotel after 11:00 pm. Other than that - if you're looking to walk out your hotel door and get to downtown or Broadway, nightlife, etc., I wouldn't recommend this hotel.

The minute you get off the elevator you will be shocked. The heated pool was under \"maintance\" as the sign read. When it finally opened, it was ice cold. They placed a liner in it. It was done badly. You can feel the pockets of air under the liner. It is kind of creepy. The part of town it is in is just scary. I feared that my car would be broken into. The night shift desk guy parked his car in front of the entrance so he could watch it from his position at the desk, and his car was a piece of crap.
