Then when I finally got there, catching a train from Trenton (the most dangerous city in the USA), I was told that they could not collect me, and that I would have to catch a cab. In the end I got ripped off by an illicit cab driver and just paid an inflated rate (no meter) because I did not want to cross someone who could be dangerous. So I was hours delayed to make use of the shuttle (which my rather poor company insisted I not use taxis). To make matters worse, the front desk is understaffed and there are delays in check in.
