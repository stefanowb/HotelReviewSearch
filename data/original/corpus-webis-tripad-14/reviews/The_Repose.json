The Riad is compact but beautifully formed and there is great attention to detail e.g. the beds and linen were great (always something that concerns me when away from ones own!). The roof terrace was a lovely, relaxing place and great for breakfast. In my opinion the mint tea and breakfasts were the best we had in Morocco. Jan and Rachid offer so much in the way of phones, maps and advice that it made our visit such smooth going and set us up for the rest of our holiday. We found wandering around Sale and it's souqs to be a lovely authentic experience and we also loved Rabat's main souq - the nicest shopping experience we had in Morocco. This Riad is a great place to chill after a busy day and as it's fairly small and owners chatty and live on site we talked a lot to them and other guests, which was great. A general point - if you like a lot of privacy you should know Riads have windows facing out into the internal courtyard/walkways and only some onto the Medina so sounds can carry more and you don't get a lot of natural light in rooms (but that's what roof terraces are for)", "title": "Lovely traditional Riad and great hosts", "user": "SassyB_67", "date": "November 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 85946699}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled on business", "text": "This is a beautiful, romantic riad in the heart of the old medina of Sale, which is the town just across the river from Rabat.

It was our first stop in a two week trip through Morocco, and as far as accommodation goes it was my favourite place. Jan and Rachid were fabulous hosts, and the rooms were fabulous, and I loved the breakfasts. I would give it 5/5 but due to a slight mix up with our reservation, we didn't get the room we wanted for the first night, so had to change rooms, which is always a bit of a pain when you just want to relax and unpack for a few days (we didn't have many days on our trip that we could do that, so it would have been nice). But on the flip side, we got to stay in another room which was quite nice too. The only other thing that was annoying was that we couldn't pay by visa, which we didn't know until we went to check out. That was a significant amount to have to pay when we had budgeted it as a visa spend, so again, slightly inconvenient.
