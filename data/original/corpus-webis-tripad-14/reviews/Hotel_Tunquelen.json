The bathroom rocked - big open room and great shower. The location was stunning, and thankfully not in the main part of town which was a bit loud. The hotel is off road through a lively garden filled drive, sitting by the main lake in a beautiful setting and mountains framing the lake. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful - we owe them so much for assisting us (particularly when one of our luggage was lost from the airline). The common areas (dining room, bar, living room, fireplace room) were cozy and large - and very comfortable. On one day when it rained, hanging in the room off on the side of the bar, near the fireplace was a perfect way to spend time waiting for the rain to stop. Oh, and breakfast was amazing - lots of food choices and all good.", "title": "Winter Vacations", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lorena_y_Gonzalo", "date": "September 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 10017473, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Views", "disliked": "\u2014 Room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006", "text": "Bariloche and the surrounding areas were more beautiful than expected - and we definitely want to return.
