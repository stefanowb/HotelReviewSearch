We got a great deal and I would highly recommend that site to travelers as well! Neither of us knew what to expect upon arrival and were very pleased with our booking when we arrived. The staff was extremely helpful with not only check-in, but helping us identify where all the major tourist sites were in relation to the hotel. The hotel is situated a short walk from Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament and tons of restaurants! (Try the Bag o\u2019 Nails for their fish and chips with mashed peas! It was so good that we went there twice!)

The elevator up to the 8th floor is extremely small! It fits 2 people comfortably. However, add luggage and an escort to your room and it\u2019s a tight squeeze! I\u2019m sure it would have been hysterical to watch 3 grown people and luggage trying to get in and out of the tiny tiny box! We were in room 879 which was non-smoking and very large! In my experience traveling Europe I have encountered many rooms that place 2 twin beds together to make a king. That was not the case here. It was an actual king bed with lots of pillows and a down comforter under the bedspread. The bathroom was exceptionally nice, and clean, with a hot towel rack and roomy shower. This room was great except for the fact that the window was blocked by the outdoor clock so we could not see the view of the courtyard.

After seeing a bus stop, hours before departure, advertising a shuttle for more than \u00bd the price of the taxi, I was very disappointed. You need to book the shuttle 24 hours in advance. The final option of getting to the airport was by bus; we were not advised of this either until I complained to the manager about it.
