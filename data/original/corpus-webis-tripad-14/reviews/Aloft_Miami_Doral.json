Our intention was to ask to extend the room until 6pm instead of the usual 12pm check out, unfortunately they would not do this without charging for a second night. I was disappointed with this however it was short lived when we saw the room. It was very large, comfortable modern and really clean, the bed was awesome! We used the gym which again was very well equipped and if the weather had been better we would have used the fab pool. We ate sliders in the bar, which were cheap microwaved cardboard, but the happy hour deal on drinks was great.", "user": "BatgirlHalstead", "date": "September 24, 2013", "id": 178479065}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "It is a Spanish speaking hotel and the majority of the guests were Spanish speaking and rather loud but we had a good nights sleep.

The elevators are just off the lobby. Decor on the room levels is nice; it feels like the designers went for trendy on a budget. All the essentials-the bed, shower, sink, the tv, etc.-were of good quality. Towels were a bit short. Room was clean and in good condition. There were some nice clever surprises.
