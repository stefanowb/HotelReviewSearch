The fitness center has some machines but they're hard to figure out and the room is tiny. Basically, it seems that the place did the minimum to become a Best Western affiliate.

Everything in the room worked. There is a small fitness center where I used the treadmill and TV, but couldn't get the other equipment to function. There were complimentary fresh towels and bottled water there as well.The inn provides a complimentary 'continental' buffet breakfast which was surprisingly good and varied (muffins, toast, waffles, cold cereals, hard-cooked eggs, juices, etc.), and the food area was spotless and well-stocked with an alert attendant constantly on the scene. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Only a couple of downsides: there is no elevator (though they did offer to help take luggage to the second floor), and my in-room safe was located on a high shelf in the closet, totally inaccessible as the closet doors do not open fully.
