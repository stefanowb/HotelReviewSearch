Overall, it was a fine experience, as long as your expectations are kept in check. First, the pros: Great location, sea-view rooms had great views, decent shower, decent sized room (by European standards) and the people were nice enough, although not particularly friendly or helpful. The cons: The restaurant in front, although a lovely setting, had below-average food and service. The interior of the hotel is dim and a bit worn-down. And the trade-off for a sea-view room is the noise, as the ferries dock right outside and there can be quite a bit of revelling late into the night. Still, it's a good value.", "title": "Nice hotel, but not great", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "ChicoBKNY", "date": "May 19, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3487433}], "location": {"country": "Croatia", "region": "Dalmatia", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 0, "very good": 3, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 0.692307692308}
