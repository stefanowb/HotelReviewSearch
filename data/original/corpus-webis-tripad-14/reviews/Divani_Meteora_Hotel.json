The dinner and breakfast had some variety but not nearly as good as the Divani Caravel in Athens just to give some comparison within the Divani offerings. The rooms were nice but the bathroom felt tiny. Wifi was not included which was surprising. The most annoying thing was the TV had limited channels and many of them would run for about 3 or so minutes before asking for 24 euros to be able to watch the channel for the next 24 hours. We had no intention of using any channel for 24 hours, maybe 1-2 hours max. We're there to see the monasteries, not be surcharged for a little downtime in the room before we go to sleep. We had no interaction with the staff so I can't comment on service as our arrangements were all handled by the tour. Our room faced the mountain cliffs behind the hotel but most of the view was blocked by another part of the hotel building itself. This was room 231 I think, so avoid 31 on any floor I would recommend. Rooms on either side of us were not as blocked from the view.
