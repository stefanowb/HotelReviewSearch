Location is perfect, a few blocks from Rembrandtsplein and multiple tram stops, a 10=15 minute walk from the Rijksmuseum, but quiet and peaceful at the same time. It's a wonderful retreat from the busy city. We also found many good restaurants within a few blocks, including Thai, Rijstaafel, and Italian. The room was lovely with a beautiful canal view. Though not huge, it was space enough and very homey. If you're looking for something more expansive, room #5 seemed large and had its own little outdoor patio (it was on the garden, not canal, side). Everything is clean and creatively decorated. Each day began sitting by the window eating the breakfast brought to our room on china and watching the passersby along the canal. There were vast quantities of breads, croissant, yogurt, sliced cheese and turkey, along with juice, coffee and tea. You can even make lunch with the leftovers and carry it with you for a picnic! My only recommendation would be to vary the breakfast a little - even if it's just changing the types of breads or pastries, or perhaps a different cheese or even slice of quiche. The hosts were unobtrusive but helpful when asked. They even let us make short calls to our kids back in the States for free, and let me check-in for our return flight on their computer. All in all, it's a wonderful place to stay-quiet, perfect location, lovely room and courteous, professional staff.
