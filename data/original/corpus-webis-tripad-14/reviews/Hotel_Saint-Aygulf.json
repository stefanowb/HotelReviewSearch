Courteous, although slightly overworked, staff (too much to do all at the same time). Room and bathroom were clean, well-maintained, and of reasonable size. Our pre-arrival e-mail request to have something delivered to our room was responded to immediately and handled perfectly. Free parking was great but spaces became scarce. Two minor dings. The entry hall and area are kind of beat up and shopworn. And the view of the sea from our sea view room was a view of a little bit of the sea and a lot of other stuff, including a row of restaurants and other businesses across the highway which stands between the hotel and the beach. Also, the hotel strongly caters to Dutch guests and has numerous Dutch staff, so if you want a French experience, this is not the place.", "title": "A solid choice.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "hcajones", "date": "May 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130056232}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Spent 2 nights here,but had not realised on booking it was owned by Van der Valk,a Dutch company. Luckily I've stayed at several of their hotels in Holland,and find them of a good quality. The St Aygulf is no exception. It is clearly well run and managed, with Dutch standards,rather than French ones to the fore. The rooms offer excellent value for the standard,with comfy beds,efficient aircon,and a modern bathroom. Breakfast service is of Dutch standard,but the food in the dinner restaurant is also done to Dutch tastes,and rather lacks French flair. There are several little eateries across the road on the beach,so one could always go there for a change of scene. I found it a bit bizarre,being an Englishman who is a French resident, being spoken to in Dutch by waiters,barstaff etc, but I guess they assume that everyone there comes from Holland ! If you are looking for a stay by the sea at a reasonable price in what is quite an expensive area, or are looking for a stopover (it's only 15 mins off the A8) the St Aygulf is a good option.", "title": "A little bit Of Amsterdam in S France", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "johnPerpignan", "date": "October 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119068824}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I put this hotel as Average, although it is very close to Very Good, i would have selected 'good' if i had the choice at tripadvisor.", "title": "nice hotel but simple improvements could make it a great one", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "pat_sanders", "date": "July 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115425288}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Rooms; clean; cool (with AC); nice beds (although our bed was VERY noisy, somehow it was not leveled correctly) which was a bit annoying.
