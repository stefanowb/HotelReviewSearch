I had some pasta one night in the downstairs restaurant and wasn't very impressed, but pasta isn't exactly known as a forte of Malaysia. The only thing that would have been better is some cheaper and more varied room service food items, because I was so sick I barely had the energy to go outside the room to eat, not having much on the in room menu didnt help me, I probably could have asked for them to make something, but it would be nice if it was already on the menu.
