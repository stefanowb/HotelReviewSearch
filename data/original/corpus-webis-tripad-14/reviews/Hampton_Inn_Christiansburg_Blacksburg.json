The hotel is located in a newer area of Christiansburg (box stores and businesses - an Outback Steakhouse is just across the street) and is accessible to both Christiansburg and Blacksburg via 460. The property is very well kept and the room was very comfortable. We had stayed in two other hotels on our trip and my mother commented how nicely decorated the room was - very calming colors. The room and bathroom were very clean and the room had no odor at all. We had two dogs with us and the hotel is very pet friendly. Fridge and microwave in room, and a nice grassy dog potty area complete with a bag/trash station. When I checked in they said that guests with pets are on the first two floors, although we did not see anyone else with a dog. The elevator is very fast and the door closes slowly, both good when traveling with dogs. All of the outside doors (except front) are locked at all times and you had a feeling that the hotel is very secure. We did not use the outside patio area/pool/lounge but many guests were using them. Coffee/hot water are available 24/7 and the breakfast was very nice. Our only complaint (very minor) is that you rarely saw the person manning the breakfast area - at other Hampton Inn's I've stayed at this has not been the case. But all the meal choices were available and we did not need anything - just an observation.
