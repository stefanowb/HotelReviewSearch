Brave a stay in the old wing and risk being trapped in a time warp, like it's 1984, with mold and old school fixtures giving you that authentic feel. This ex Sheraton property is in subang jaya and works well if you need to be in that area. Staff are well meaning but too oft slow to respond. But warm and friendly, nevertheless. Check out the lobby bar, a real retro treasure, totally enjoyed the girl-trio rework of Rihanna. They stop by your-table to introduce themselves after each set. The rooms in the new wing area clean, contemporary, connected - a nice find. And theckub floor is. Nice little sanctuary from the tour bus madness that happens downstairs most mornings. Overall, I recommend this if you need to stay in the area.
