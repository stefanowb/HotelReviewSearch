There was NO soap at all in our room but my daughter had two in her room so she gave us one so I wouldn't have to call down and wait for someone to deliver it. The shampoo in my daughter's room was mostly gone. I guess they don't check to see what toiletries are left after each guest. Also the air conditioner does make a racket every time it kicks in...I kept thinking it was thunder. But the room was clean and there was breakfast included.

Yes, the corridors are scruffy but work will shortly start to modernise these. However, most of the rooms have now been renovated and the hotel plans to improve the facilities even more. Every visitor has a list of 'must haves' from an hotel. Quality of the beds and the bed linen is top of my list and I can't fault the Holiday Inn on this. They even have a pillow menu! The showers are good and the bathrooms are roomy. However, the real value is in the quality of the service. The people who work in this hotel are exceptional.
