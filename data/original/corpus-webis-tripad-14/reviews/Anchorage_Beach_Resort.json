Rooms quite basic although they are palatial in comparison to surrounding villages and homes. Some staff are very good and attentive. On my visit I found the service slow. on the first occassion we ordered lunch and had to wait almost an hour to be served, this was probably due to a large group from ANZ bank who had a buffet organised. The second was poor service and a long wait for dinner because a group of travel agents had decided to stay at the hotel. Their dinner was served with enthusiasm whereas our group were small and had been there for three nights. We would not eat at the same hotel 4 nights in succession had there been anywhere else to go, so they had a captive audience so to speak. One night we fancied choosing a pizza, but were told that they had ran out of cheese, quite strange when they were giving out Pizza menus cards, if i was suspicious I would suggest it was due to pizzas being half the price of their other main meals !!! The resort taxis are very unrelaible, we had an occassion where we were waiting 2 hours on the resort van coming for us, it was taking the \"its Fiji Time\" to extreme, particularly when we had called the hotel 2 times and was assued it would be with us shortly, in the Fiji humidity this was probably not the best thing to say for customer service. the offer of a free drink was accepted but later we got a soft dring\"on the house\" I suppose they suspected I would choose an expensive cocktail if asked,", "title": "Some good points and some bad", "user": "scot5", "date": "November 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 88675691}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We stay here for a week on our holiday after having stay at amunuca resort (which was wonderful) and when we arrive having booked for 2 adults and 2 children in a mountain view room we were shown to a room with 1 queen bed, we had to go and ask for extra bed for our children where they brought a cot and a single. Then we wanted to town and the hotel taxi charged us twice what the local taxi drivers charge from Loutoka. The walk down the hill to the restraurant was very difficult with little one and if you wanted to get a ride up or down you had to wait at least 1/2 an hour or more for someone to come and get you. The continental breakfast included in the room was alright but the rest of the food was disgusting it was cheap and it would also give you food poisoning my husband ordered a steak one night which was rancid and we ordered our son a pizza on an other night and the cheese was bad on it. The pool was clean and the view was nice as well as the population of mosquitoes there is no beach only mangroves and on the other side3 of the resort the mud flats are covered in rubbish and the ocean is so disgusting and grimy you wouldn't want to swim in it. The resort offer no real activities except their trip to beach comber island. The photos on the web site make it look really nice but the room we stayed in looked nothing like any of the photos on their page.

Met some wonderful people. Rooms spacious and clean. We were staying at the mountain view rooms and the walk to and from breakfast in the morning was refreshing. Staff always willing to transport guests in cars if they couldn't make the hill! Very good exercise. The staff were all exceptionally pleasant and always joking and laughing. The food was very good and plenty of choice. Didn't read any reviews before we left, as we prefer to make our own judgment rather than rely on what others think. The cane train passing through the grounds was quite magical. Cannot comprehend why some guests find it unacceptable. No pleasing everyone. Would most definitely return to the Anchorage.
