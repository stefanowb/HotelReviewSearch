Breakfast was very good and probably worth the 100CNY (12\u20ac) as there was plenty of choice and tasted delicious; a good start to the day. The only criticism about the hotel is its location and the lack of free internet access. I suspect the internet charges are more to do with the Chinese authorities, and the hotel business centre is very helpful if you have a problem. There is an ATM on site and plenty of taxies waiting to take you anywhere (as long as it isn't raining!). When arriving at the airport you MUST have the hotel written in Chinese (you can print this off with a google map and a picture of the hotel beside it) this will allow taxi drivers to know where to take you. The hotel will give you plenty of the much needed address cards when you arrive. The location of the hotel is the only serious drawback; you need to travel by taxi everywhere.
