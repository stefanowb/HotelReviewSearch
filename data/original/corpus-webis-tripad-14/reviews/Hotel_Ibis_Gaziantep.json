But their website and email are no longer working so we chose to stay at the Ibis. The Ibis is well located and convenient - especially to the new mosaic museum. We arrived on a 1:30am flight -so their 24 hour service desk was great. We were able to stay on a non smoking floor. The hotel is typical Ibis - so not as much local color as at the Yesemek - and the breakfast was just spectacular with lots of choices.
