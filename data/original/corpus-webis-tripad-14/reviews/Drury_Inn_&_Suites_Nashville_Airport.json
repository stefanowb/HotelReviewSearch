It was everything it is advertised that it is , even more ! The staff is beyond helpful and very friendly. The Hotel is extremely clean, and the breakfast and dinner time \"snacks\" are wonderful.And great for the budget.....FREE ! It only takes a few minutes to get downtown, and many of the other places you want to go. Even being by the airport, the noise did not bother us in the least. Didn't even notice it ! The hotel desk staff was very helpful, as to offer suggestions on where to visit,where to eat, and attractions to see. Thanks Leslie ! Also the GM was very kind in the evening, just to talk to us, asking how our stay was and just offering small talk about the area..... The cleaning staff was excellent, couldn't ask for anything any better.. The only thing that was a little different for me was the pet policy. We don't travel with pets, and that is just \"our preference\" but it is VERY pet friendly. Again, I am not saying that it is a bad thing, but if a person has dander issues and pet allergies, you might have to reconsider staying at this hotel.

But, this cannot be said of the Nashville Airport property. Do not be fooled by other glowing write-ups you may have seen. Last week, I was given a room with a toilet that hadn't been flushed. In my first ten minutes there, a very large tentacled insect needed to be mashed against a wall. That night, the fire alarm went off twice. When I called the front desk the second time it happened, I was spoken to in an unmistakably rude manner by the attendant, who sighed into the receiver and suggested I should have known there was no fire because the alarm went off. He volunteered that kids playing around with the fire alarm is something that happens there a lot. The ultimate take away? How dare I expect anything better. Adding insult to injury, I chatted with the hotel's GM the next day. He never apologized for my front desk treatment, and bent over backwards to defend his staff rather than expressing any concern for my future business.
