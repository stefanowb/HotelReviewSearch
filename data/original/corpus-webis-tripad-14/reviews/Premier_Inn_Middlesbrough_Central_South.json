Middlesbrough is a really friendly place and this included the service from all the staff at the premier inn. We ate at the Toby carvery next door and again the staff were so helpful and couldn't do Enough for us. We were able to buy a carafe of chilled house wine to take back to our room to relax before dinner. The meal was good value for the price we paid and the desserts super value. We didn't do breakfast as we'd eaten at the carvery and were also due to eat out later in the day.
