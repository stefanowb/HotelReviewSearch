We had a very comfortable and relaxing stay. Our room was very spacious, clean and well-arranged. As usual, the bed was above average for comfort, as we've found every time with the Holiday Inn Express chain. The pillows are great and there are lots of them. The bathroom was spacious and the shower has a great curved rod to keep all drafts out. The water pressure was a little lacking, but not terrible. The air conditioning unit was a bit noisy, but not even close to the horrible ones in the Minot Holiday Inn Express. This one was noticable, but not unbearable. Our only negative was the continental breakfast. The orange juice machine ran out. The coffee was barely coffee, more like hot water, no whole wheat or grain bagels, only white, the cinnamon rolls were rock hard and cold, with no way to warm them, and only bananas as a choice of fruit. Very poor for a continental!! We liked the hotel very much though, and will definitely stay there again.....but we will go to a restaurant for breakfast.", "title": "Very comfortable stay", "user": "Travellers007", "date": "August 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 18662600, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very clean, very comfortable beds and very spacious rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 The continental breakfast was terrible"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at this Holiday Inn", "title": "I'd stay here again", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TXtraveler123", "date": "July 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 17814952, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean, comfortable", "disliked": "\u2014 not on GPS"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Express for one night while traveling to a family reunion. I was happily surprised how nice it was. The room was clean and up-to-date with a huge plasma TV. The free breakfast was great as well. Unlike some reviewers, our experience with the staff was good. I found everyone there to be friendly and helpful. Our GPS system could not locate this hotel for some reason but the hotel staff directed us easily. If this is what all Holiday Inn Express are like, I am going to give up on higher price hotels and try them next time.", "title": "Beautiful room, nice linens and great plasma tv", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "llongrider1", "date": "July 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17646193, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Located in busy shopping area.
