It took our breath away when we first entered it. The porch leads right into the lagoon and we swam everyday BEFORE breakfast! When we were there, high tide was at noon when the current was a bit too strong for weak swimmers, so the best time for a bit of swimming and snorkelling was in the morning.

And yes...take some bread from breakfast to feed the fish! Upon the adivise of some the guys here, we brought our own snorkels and masks. And aqua shoes are a must! I only wore 2 kinds of shoes there, my sandals and the aqua shoes...We experienced our first ever full moon moonrise when we had our dinner at Atoll Grill which is on the eastern side of the island.

I will start of with what we liked about Full Moon. It is a beautiful resort with clear blue water and the food is good. Unfortunately, we have more things about the Full Moon that we didn't like. We were there for 5 days and went Nov 06, the \"dry\" season and it rained on and off the entire trip. With that being said, if it is raining, there is nothing to do on the resort. They don't offer indoor activities. We made our reservations with the hotel directly, so after flying all day and arriving at the resort at 11:00PM, they would not let us go to our room without paying the bill FIRST. We found that to be very irritating and very unaccomidating. We had half board which includes breakfast and dinner. The dinner was good but the breakfast got a little old because the menu never changed. We ate lunch at one of the local restaruants and it was very expensive; a hamburger with fries cost $15.00 (that was the cheapest spot). Oh yeah, and we had to buy our water at dinner! We found that the service was slow and everything has a 10% surcharge, which is the tip. So, for dinner, we bought a large bottle of water to go with our meal for $4.00 and paid $.40 in a tip. We had an overwater bungalow and unfortunatly couldn't really swim much outside our bungalow. The water was shallow and rocky. The best (and pretty much the only beach) was on the other side where the beach bungalows were. One evening we went into one of the bars and noticed several people in the bar and some food. We walked up to the bar and about to order a drink when someone on the staff came up to us and started making small talk. He eventually got to his point by telling us it was a privat party and that everyone there was invited. So, we got the hint and left. Since this bar was 1 of 2 bars and they advertised that bar being open for happy hour, we found that to be very classless. For what we were paying, we expected to be pampered and we weren't. The hotel offers no incentives for those who rent pricer rooms, like the overwater bungalows. Before we arrived at the Maldives, we spent a few days in Cambodia (Siem Reap) staying at the Le Meridian. We were spoiled there with the service we received and the \"freebies\" that came with our room (like free internet access, complementary drinks etc).
