The Albatros sits overlooking the beach/bay with fabulous views from every room. All of which are beautifully decorated and offer everything you could wish for (air con, free Wifi, hair dryer, fridge etc...). The hotel is owned by Christos and Tassos and the two brothers and their family offer genuine, friendly hospitality at its best. Each morning is greeted with a lovely, fresh breakfast buffet and the restaurant offers simple, well presented Greek cuisine for lunch and dinner. There is a lovely pool and the beach (with giant white cushions to relax in the sun on) is a minute's walk away. There is a complimentary shuttle bus to Mykonos Town six times a day (only 15 minutes away and both day and night). Then comes the price - so reasonable and a nice choice of rooms, bungalows and an amazing Honeymoon/Party Suite with a private pool and stunning views from the terrace.
