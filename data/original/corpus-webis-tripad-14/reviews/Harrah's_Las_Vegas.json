Our room in the Mardi Gras Tower was perfectly nice. Not big, but it seemed renovated. Clean, neat, all you'd expect. The usual beige bland hotel decoration. A mini bar, though no room safe. We had a view of the parking buildings and a tiny almost-balcony you could edge two toes onto. We'd requested non-smoking, but despite an absence of ashtrays, our room had certainly housed smokers in the recent past. Never to mind... it was our last night, we were prepared to be generous. So the room, the rate, the location, the bar... all thumbs up. Thumbs down on the casino, which was noisy in an annoying, rather than exciting way. Smoky too. And confusingly laid out, so it was a long walk to the check in desk. More downward thumbs on those airline vouchers, which require you to book your ticket through a certain travel agency. Not necessarily a disadvantage, but not as straightforward as they made it sound. Thumbs undecided about the sleep factor - when we got back to the room at 2am, the music from Carnaval Court couldn't be heard. When we'd gone out at 8pm, however, it was fairly loud, so if you're bothered by the thumping of a bass beat in the early evening hours, this may not be the place for you. We'd possibly stay at Harrahs again, but while it was good, it was nothing extraordinary - and nothing we'd have reason to become totally loyal to.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 10, 2004", "id": 1545152}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Harrah's Is Our Favorite", "text": "My sisters and I stayed at Harrah's from 1/2-1/5.

She took the charge off our bill which I thought was very nice of her since we made the mistake.

I must admit we chose Harrahs because we had comped rooms and each time we visit Vegas we stay at the property. I must say, we were disappointed in everything from the housekeeping (did not sweep the floors the entire time we were there) to the casino. I have always liked the Harrah's properties but I do believe this one has slid down hill a bit. Each time I have visited the Las Vegas location, we have been given an upgraded room. Not this time. We had two standard rooms. The rooms were not clean and we had to asked the maid to sweep the floors. The sinks did not drain in either bathroom and the shower, even though the curtain was inside the tub, leaked all over the floor. I usually can win at least a little money while I'm there but not this time. The slots were really tight. In fact, I didn't see anyone win the entire time we were there and we played mostly at Harrahs. The pool was just OK (make sure you don't move the lounge chairs). The food was just OK.
