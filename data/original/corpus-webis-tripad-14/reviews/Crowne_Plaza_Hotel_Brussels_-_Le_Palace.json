The architecture is a mix of art deco and art nouveau which is in keeping with the character of the actual building. That is not to say that the fittings and fixtures are original, they aren't but the hotel has been recently (in the last few years from my enquiries) renovated in the art deco/art nouveau style and it has been done very nicely in my opinion... if this style isn't to your liking that's ok... but it certainly doesn't detract from the functionality of the room at all. The room we had had no view to speak of as the window faced a wall but the window itself was large and let in adequate natural light during the day. The room was quite large with a desk and a couch, arm chair and stand alone wardrobes and as one would expect from a Crowne Plaza it was kept spotlessly clean. The breakfast was good and whilst i agree with some reviewers that the price was a bit excessive it was included in our deal rate which is why we enjoyed it. At the price mentioned in previous reviews we wouldn't have availed ourselves of it, rather grabbed breakfast at one of the numerous eateries in close proximity. Overall we were very happy with the hotel itself but what stood out for me was the staff. there were all very professional but i sought out the duty manager on our second day there to let him know of one particular staff member who I felt out of his way to be helpful to the extent of looking up and printing off train timetables for some day trips we wanted to take whilst we were staying at the hotel and indeed AFTER we had left the hotel... for me that is going above and beyond... for the life of me I can't think of that young mans name at the moment but i did write a report about him and gave it to the Guest Experience Manager, a young man by the name of Alexandre Francois, who also is a credit to the hotel. On our last day as we were checking out he handed me an envelope which contained a handwritten note thanking me for taking the time to give positive feedback. I travel a lot and there will always be minor problems with check ins or the room not having the correct quota of towels... but it is the way in which the staff deal with these minor things and indeed the bigger things when they arise which makes a good hotel even better.... and i believe that the this hotel calls into that category..because of the staff and their attitude towards their guests", "title": "Hotel looks dated, air in room is stuffy as air con is not available = uncomfortable", "user": "Peter A", "date": "October 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 142415257}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "the hotel was very good.It's location helped me to enjoy my staying in the city and visit all the major tourist attractions. the stuff was very kind and helpful, and the rooms were very nice. to sum up my staying was very good and i deeply recommend about this hotel", "title": "Older property, but great location and excellent service", "user": "VineetD", "date": "October 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142365913}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012", "text": "Stayed there just before taking a plane to Italy the next day.

The check-in is swift and competent, the staff very friendly indeed. Nevertheless, the hotel is having this kind of 'slightly chipped and worn' character. This becomes even more clear once you enter the room. It is a nice decor but it is worn out.
