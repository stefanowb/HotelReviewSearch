{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 343, "name": "Inn at Whitewell", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "and anyone else, too - if you can manage without air-conditioning and can cope without being near a shopping mall and feel like a taste of the Best of Idiosyncratic Britain, then I insist that you make a detour to this hostelry. It lies in one of the most beautiful and peaceful parts of the country half way between the English and Scottish capitals. Family-owned for decades, it is furnished with a random but interesting collection of pieces including a quirky selection of elaborate Victorian and Edwardian baths. The place is definitely stylish - it shelters under the 'shabby/chic' umbrella. Many rooms have working fireplaces. We called the hotel with our ETA and the peat fire in our room was burning merrily on arrival. There are books everywhere, Wifi is free (how dare hotels in the U.S. charge for that?), mobile reception is patchy - this place is remote. Few cars pass and it is heaven to experience deep quiet at night. Service is a delight - the warmth and natural friendliness of the staff are in marked contrast to the hotel-school taught cool efficiency. The food is excellent and sourced locally and reception is housed in a cramped corner of what appears to be, and is, a vintners. You are unlikely to have stayed anywhere like this before. I cannot commend it enough for its originality and charm. The bed was comfortable, linen was good, towels plentiful, Molton Brown 'products', but you must be prepared for worn carpets, scuffed skirting boards, creaking floors. Higgledy piggledy it may well be but the Inn at Whitewell, if you have a soul, will give you untold pleasure.", "title": "Any Americans out there, listen up -", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shellfire", "date": "March 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155304283}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "3rd visit, we're about 60 miles away & stopped over for wedding anniversary.
