We were very satisfied with the hotel and only had some minor niggles. The rooms and public areas looked exactly as they did on the Expedia website. It is a drab building from the outside but modern with contemporary design when you get inside. When we checked in at noon and requested a room on a high floor facing the back, we were told at reception that we could have one if we were prepared to wait until 2 pm. We waited and got room no. 819, which was perfect with regards to noise and view. It was a reasonable size but not exactly spacious. It offered what most travellers look for: a huge bed (a bit hard), safe, clean bathroom, hair dryer, air conditioning and TV with some international channels. The view was great, we could even see the Sagrada Familia! One complaint that I had, was that there was no electrical socket near a mirror, so I had to use my hair straightener using the reflection in the television. Even though it was a busy street, we had no noise in our room at night. However, the cleaners were quite loud in the morning so you could not have a lie-in beyond 9 am. We had a problem with the electricity in our room the morning after arrival, but it was fixed promptly. The breakfast was good and varied (although I missed normal fresh croissants), but expensive if not pre-booked. The small pool and sun deck on the roof were nice and usually very busy. The view was spectacular and we used this area to relax in the early evening on a couple of occasions. In some reviews it was mentioned that the neighbourhood is a bit dodgy. Well, the hotel is on a busy main road, so no safety issues here apart from the traffic. There are so many directions that you could go, that you can avoid walking through El Raval if you want to. I actually quite like this barrio, which has a lot of character with some nice shops, restaurants and bars, and I felt perfectly safe during the day. One observation: there were some prostitutes lined up at Carrer Tigre and on Sunday afternoon families gathered on benches nearby to watch them going about their business. Great free family entertainment for grandparents and their small grandchildren! Anyway, at night we would avoid this area and took a taxi to the hotel.

All for just shy of \u00a3100 per night. Last time I stayed it was winter, so this time I made sure we visited the roof terrace. It really is a great sun trap, and it is a great way to get away from the bustling sounds of the city, and not too many people seem to realise it exists. The breakfast was fairly reasonable with a decent buffet selection, although I wouldn't have paid the 15 euro supplement had we been room only, as there are plenty of cafes locally. Why do people stuff their plates with the most disgusting concoctions? As usual in hotels, the toaster was really slow and didn't even brown my bread after four attempts. The staff were very helpful, although one member of staff was trying to recommend one bus tour company over another but we went with the other one anyway as the route was more suitable to our needs. We witnessed one member of staff being particularly patient with one couple who couldn't work out how when they needed to get to the airport for their flight.

We used the bar a few times on our way in/out of an evening, which was convenient and fairly well priced. Curiously though they don't do large beers - it only comes in 30cl glasses. We had to wait a couple of times for the barman to appear as well. The only slight downside of the stay was that we had a group of people on our floor for the first couple of nights who insisted on talking loudly to each other in the corridor.
