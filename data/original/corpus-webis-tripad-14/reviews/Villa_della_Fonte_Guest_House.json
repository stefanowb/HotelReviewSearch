The staff is so helpful and charming. The rooms are very clean, especially since there is no smoking allowed. Breakfast on the terrace is quite nice; if you want fresh fruit, there is an open air market 2 blocks away. Also there is air-conditioning, which is very important since the lively Trastevere area can be extremely noisy into the early morning hours. You can walk everywhere from this central location, and you're surrounded by restaurants and bars. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "CharlieMontereyCA", "date": "June 14, 2004", "id": 2187902}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful small hotel...", "text": "My husband and I just returned from a one week trip to Rome (5/15-5/22). This is a small but terrific hotel. Our room was small, but nicely decorated and had an en-suite bathroom. The hotel was just redone in 2000 so everything is new. They have a lovely terrace where they serve breakfast every morning. Breakfast is included in the pricing. The front desk is open 24hrs a day, so you can have all of your questions answered. The location is terrific!! We walked everywhere from the Vatican to the Piazza Navona. No problem. The Trastevere is the best place to be at night, it is all resturaunts, bars, wine bars, and people watching. I would suggest this hotel to younger singles or couples, the walking might be too much for some, and it is a busy area at night. Also, this is not the most touristy area, so most people speak little English. We don't speak Italian, but we got by ok. One other thing, no cars can drive down the street of the hotel, so you have to get dropped off or picked up by taxi a few short blocks away. We found it helpful to have the phone number for the taxi driver to call the hotel directly to get directions. Have fun in Rome, Ciao!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 31, 2004", "id": 2132570}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "trastevere - the place to stay", "text": "fab little guest house that was welcoming and spotlessly clean. rooms are nice, beds are really confortable and the power shower a dream!. walked EVERYWHERE from here and only had to take a bus when we had our luggage on the way home.

We were there in November and as the roof terrace was closed our breakfast was delivered to our room every morning. Do not be put off by the fact that it is located off a side street with graffiti filled walls, that is just the way Trastevere seems to be.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "por_1971", "date": "December 1, 2003", "id": 1503168}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lazio", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Rome"}, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 3, "very good": 35, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 73}, "aka": "Villa Della Fonte Guest House Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0946372239748}
