Excellent check in, ticket for complimentary drinks at the pool bar and 10% off offers at certain restaurants and bars as guests of Fuente Park. We had a couple of breakfasts and the odd lunch at the pool bar, the food was very nice and very good value for money at about 3.50 euros would reccomend. The location is excellent with shops and bars and restaurants literally a couple of minutes walk from the apartments and just another few minutes to the beach. The apartments are very peaceful and relaxing and we weren't disturbed by any noise even though we were only a few minutes from the main strip. We had a nice meal in the Waikiki restaurant down at the beach looking out over the moonlit sea, very reasonalble prices with meals from 8.50 euros. Drinks in most bars were 2 euros for local beer and 3 euros for Carling, you could get local spirits with mixers for about 3 euros in most bars although 2 bacardi and cokes were 11 euros in the Rock Cafe but they had a fantastic group playing there. If you like good old british holiday entertainment go to the Talk of the Town and Golden Days 60's & 70's bar with karioke, quiz nights and elvis impersonator! and english tv channels, we were able to watch X Factor there - Joe to win! We really enjoyed our holiday in Corralejo, the weather was great at this time of year 24 -27 degrees and would go back to Fuente Park apartments.

A 2 min walk takes you to the shopping area with plenty of restaurants and an rather scrummy curry house 5 mins away that also delivers.
