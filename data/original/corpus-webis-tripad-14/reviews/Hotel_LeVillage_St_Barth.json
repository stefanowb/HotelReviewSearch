We had the feeling of having our own place with the little cottage, and being able to cater to our own needs. A little walk to the beach, much harder on the way back because we have to climb up the hill, but a little exercise is no harm. Everything works adequately, and internet access is available at the Reception (front desk). Being in St Jean is great because you have plenty of shopping even within walking distance (walking is a big deal considering the tropical heat). A word of warning, to get from st Marteen to St. Barth, traveling by boat with the Voyager can be quite a torture. (We did not go with Rapid Explorer because they were out of service). Despite what they said, Voyager does not seem to care for passengers' comfort. The sea can be real rough, and 1 hour 30 minutes in their loud music, being thown around by the sea is quite a torture.

I explained to all that we had ants in the bed. Ms. Charneau gave a quick smile/half laugh and simply said: \u201cants\u201d.

No affirmative \u2018yes\u2019 from anyone; just disregarded with a laugh and \u201cants\u201d. Returned to the room wondering if I had done something wrong. About 2 hours later my wife went to the reception to inquire about something else and asked if anyone was going to come take care of the ants. The C family responded by saying, \u201cwell did anyone come by and tell us you had ants?\u201d Yes, very clearly we told you we had ants in the bed. 3 hours later, at about 10:00PM, a man came by with a can of Raid while we were sitting outside on the patio. By this time there were also ants in the kitchen. In order to give an example of the type of bugs crawling in our bed, I took him over to the ants and said \u201cthese are also in our bed\u201d. He laughed! I repeatedly told him that I didn\u2019t care about the ants in the kitchen, but that there were ants like the ones in the kitchen in our bed and they were biting us.

Next four nights, in addition to the ants, I had to kill 7 roaches that were IN the room. Not outside in the kitchen, or in the bathroom, but underneath our bed and crawling up our dresser. Every time you flipped the light switch, one or two roaches would scurry across the floor. How much were we paying per night? $500. For $500 you get the added honeymoon experience of killing roaches every day. What did family C do about it? Absolutely nothing. After explaining to them each morning that we found it unacceptable to sleep with ants and to kill roaches, they did nothing. They rudely shrugged us off. Not once in our entire stay did Ms. C say \u201csorry\u201d. That is what prompted this review. No acknowledgement that we even had an issue; complete disregard of what we had to say, and never an apology! Instead they gave us the argument that \u201cit\u2019s part of the tropical experience\u201d. To sleep with ants in your bed and kill roaches that are clinging to your clothes hanging in the closet is ridiculous and shouldn\u2019t be part of a $500/night hotel experience.

There are great beaches- Gouveneur and Saline, or a walk of 25 minutes to Columbier is worth it. Shell Beach, in walking distance from Gustavia, is not as big and is more crowded, but is worth it for the shells, and a drink at sunset at Do Brazil, which also is worth a dinner visit. Best restaurants were Wall House (relatively reasonable, classy and friendly service, and delicious Prix Fixe dinner) Zanzibarth- expensive but very good food; Eddie's in Gustavia is o.k. and reasonable; K'fe Massai is good prix fixe. Lunch prices are as much as dinner prices in the states. The big supermarket across the street (literally from the airport)is a great source for make your own food (picnic lunch for the beach, or back at the unit dinner). Most places will give you an honest exchange rate to pay in dollars, but check the exchange rate before going. Some will rip you off, and you should charge the meal, even though credit card companies will add 2-3% on foreign currency charges. Shopping in Gustavia is high end stuff, and there are places where you can get a good buy, but they are off the main street.
