I even called several times to request a refurbished airconditioned unit. I was politely told my request was noted but they could not guarantee that it would be granted. Luckily we did receive a newly refurbished and aircondiotioned unit and it was absolutely lovely, I was impressed. The furnishings were very modern and comfortable. The kitchen had everything I needed. We were on the first floor and had a lovely outlook onto thick tropical gardens and lovely palm trees aswell as the pool. The pool was great for the kids. We were there at peak time and it was never overly busy and you could always get a deck chair. Very close to beach with a security gate leading out to a path that led directly to the beach. Overall I had a great stay, it was comfortable and family friendly. However I would insist on a refurbished airconditioned unit as I did glance into other units that hadn't been re-done and they did look very tired and dated.", "user": "kazkap", "date": "January 23, 2008", "id": 12913236}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Incredibly bad !", "text": "After previous great experiences I recently stayed at the Grande Florida and was sorely disappointed. The rooms were very tired and are desperately in need of a refurbish. The staff are extremely discourteous and show little interest in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay.

We asked for a ground floor flat, but got top floor. We had an elderly couple with us who one could not get up and down the stairs, but could not change rooms, as they were full. The flat was rather dirty, and 2 days was very noisy with workmen in next flat renovating. We would not stay there again.
