The bad news is that it is a bit tired and perpetully crowded. Long waits for lifts, check-in, conceirge assistance and the odd crazy person being shooed along remind you that you are virtually inside a major railways station. Despite the madness, the staff are great and highly efficient, as has been noted by others.

Hilton Group should ensure that all their staff visit this hotel and then set a training programme based upon the excellent and unpretentious services levels which the Hilton London Paddington brilliant affords its guests. The location of the hotel is most convenient, it is located directly in London Paddington Railway Station, the station has the London Underground Bakerloo Line, Hammersmith & City Line and Cirlce lines directly under the station, these lines give easy access to any point in London. Paddington Station also has a direct train line to London Heathrow Airport, this service is called the Heathrow Express and operates every 15 minutes to and from Heathrow every day and the journey takes just over 20 minutes. The hotel itself is great, as previously said the staff are amazing, they are so professional and pleasent and they can't do enough for you, an absolute pleasure to speak with them. The hotel has a restaurant, bar and a Casino, there is also a fitness centre but we did not use this. If your budget allows I would definitely recommend that you book a King Bed Junior Suite and request a room with Balcony on the 6th floor, these rooms are amazing, the balconies give superb views over the surrounding streets of London and its great to sit on the balcony in the evening with a drink or in the morning with Breakfast from room service. We had room number 654 and this is definitely the best Junior Suite room, it has the largest balcony you could ever have in a London Hotel, I think this room must have once been the penthouse suite, the balcony was split level and had 4 tables each with 4 chairs around them, it also had several sunbeds, it was fantastic to sit on the balcony in the morning with our fantastic breakfast from room service, it truly was unbelievably amazing for a London Hotel. Please note that not all King Bed Junior Suites have a balcony, only the ones on the 6th floor have a balcony, and only room 654 has the very very large balcony. Also, all bookings for Junior Suites gives you access to the Executive Lounge, this lounge gives complimentary alcoholic drinks, canapes and snacks from 630pm to 830pm and you also get free continental breakfast in the lounge. We will be returning to the London Hilton Paddington very soon, we can't wait, and we will hope to get room 654 !
