The staff were friendly enough, the breakfasts were outstanding and the location was good, 5 euros in a taxi to the centre of Palma or a beautiful walk along passed the marina and some of the biggest yachts you will ever see. The pool area was great plenty of space and a nice bar to cool down at. Although we didn't have a cathedral view we did have a sea view of the marina. Our rooms were great, large and clean and well maintained. Flights and hotel were booked through flyglobespan.

This area which the hotel is situated is ideal for visiting palma, the Cathedral being a short 15min walk, (a walk being the best way to try and burn of the breakfast calories). Numerous restaurants close to the hotel all around the same price all of good quality and service.
