Don't get me wrong - we had an amazing trip, and I would still highly recommend RP, but the service just was not as good as I expected. There were a couple of exceptional staff members: Adrian on the beach was fantastic. My husband had a foot injury that required him to keep his foot elevated and iced down; and every day after the first day Adrian came over with a big bag of ice without even being asked. He also seemed genuinely concerned about the injury and inquired about my husband's comfort several times a day. His smile and laugh were infectious - I wish we could've brought him home. Likewise, we had the BEST waiters at Le Papillon, Jason and Jefferson. We dined with them 3 times during our 5 nights there and loved every minute of it. We talked quite a bit with Jefferson about authentic Jamaican food and drink, and he went out of his way to bring us some \"Sour Sop Juice\" at dinner one night for us to sample. I think we will keep in touch with him, and we really hope to see him again.

Or you should at least eat at Le Papillon every night because the Terrace food really wasn't that great.

We enjoyed the resort on each of the first two visits, but were disappointed with our visit in March. The resort is becoming \"Sandalized.\" it was purchased by Sandals a few years ago and the influence of Sandals is beginning to jeopardize the character of the resort. There are large posters on the beach and in the hotel advertising excursions and photos, and flat screen tv's in the lobby pitching excursions. Sandals recenlty opened their own company to control all the excursions (Island Routes) and one of the Stewart kids has been designated to run it. This company now parks two ugly large catamarans in the middle of the water just off the beach. They are all painted up like race cars and are eyesores. This is what I would expect at a Couples or another Sandals but not RP. The service has definitely slipped as well. It seems that alot of Sandals employees from other resorts have been transferred in and the service is much more like a mega- resport than a tranquil boutique resort. The slide was very disappointing as we loved this resort and were hoping to make it an annual trip. Also, despite this being our third trip there in 15 months, we were not recognized in any way - not even a thank you for coming back note from any of the managers. We found that much of the attention to detail noticed on previous trips had disappeared. they added butler service for all rooms. Unfortunately, we found the butlers to be unhelpful and slow. They always seemed to be busy welcoming new arrivals. We tipped our butler Cleon $20 to unpack our cases and we thought that beginning the stay with a nice healthy gratuity would set the stage for good butler service, but it didn't seem to have much of an effect. Dining service was painfully slow.
