We stayed in a King Suite with a fireplace . After a full day of sight seeing and driving around , a hot clean shower and a peaceful fire to sit by was just what was needed. The front desk staff gave us great directions to several great restaurants and always with a free map and a smile.

The rooms were beautifully appointed and spacious. I loved the fireplace and jacuzzi tub! The pool and grounds were lovely. I enjoyed my complimentary breakfast which I took back to my room. It is in a fabulous location right across from the Del Monte Shopping Center that has lots of great shopping and dining. I will highly recommend it to my colleagues, friends and family!", "title": "Would love to make this my go-to hotel in Monterey.", "user": "66henry", "date": "March 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 101436378}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 17, "average": 57, "very good": 170, "terrible": 20, "excellent": 194}, "aka": "Mariposa Hotel Monterey", "slim_ranking": 0.22641509434}
