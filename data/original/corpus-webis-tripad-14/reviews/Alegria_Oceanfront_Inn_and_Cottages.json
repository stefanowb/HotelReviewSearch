We couldn't have been happier with the owners' hospitality, the lovely (and very clean) room, and the unique and delicious breakfasts (a fantastic souffle and homemade coffee cake one morning, orange pancakes with orange maple syrup, along with chicken apple sausage the next). Our room (like pretty much all of them, it seems) had a terrific water view; the gardens are beautiful and every amenity has been thought of here. The location is terrific for Mendocino -- extremely walkable to beach, shops and restaurants while slightly set back off the road so you have a sense of privacy as well.
