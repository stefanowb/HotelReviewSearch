Like most first-time visitors to Turkey, we chose the same hotel for entry and departure for convenience. After our wonderful stay, we have no hesitation whatsoever and actually looked forward to the return to Innova on conclusion of our wonderful trip in Turkey. It was on our return that the problem occurred. We arrived at around 10:30am, after an early morning flight from Izmir. We did not request early check-in, but the gentleman, who was also the one who greeted us on our first trip, apparently recognized us and enthusiasticly offered us another hotel in Sultanahmet because (1) Innova was very fully-booked and they needed more than usual time to clean up; (2) he did not want us to waste time on waiting, which should be better spent on sight-seeing; and (3) the hotel he now offered (Lenvi Spa - which I will submit a separate review) is much much better in terms of room size and deco and we would \"forget about Innova\" right away. He said Lenvi has available rooms right away and he could arrange to have us transferred there by taxi. In order to minimize inconvenience to both, we conceded and agreed to be taken there. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we were told, not at all in a courteous manner, that (1) no room was ready; (2) check-in time is 2pm (we were actually almost given a lesson on standard hotel check-in time); and (3) Innova has not communicated with them on our unexpected arrival! It seemed to be our fault to have landed at their entrance without prior notice.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 7, 2012", "id": 129492910}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "We told Levni to call up Innova and the guy just kept apologizing on the other end but did not offer to take us back.

On reflection, we should not have agreed to leave. Innova was probably heavily over-booked (thanks at least partly to the excellent reviews at Tripadvisor) and given we had booked months ahead at a very good rate (140 euros per night), they might as well turn us away for better prices. To be fair, the hardware of this property is very good - large and quiet rooms, nice shower, clean, safe, excellent breakfast (variety may be limited but the quality is excellent, much better than Lenvi's), very convenient to sights (except the steep climb to the tram stop); but you will have to give a second thought on the soft side, particularly if, like me, you have made a booking at a good rate.
