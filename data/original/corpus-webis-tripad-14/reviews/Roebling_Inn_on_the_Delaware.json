The location is perfect (2 hours outside NYC) right on the Delaware river surrounded by gorgeous trees and the historic Roebling bridge. The owners are incredibly friendly and provide you with tons of suggestions on how you can spend your day; canoeing, horseback-riding, a pottery trail, waterfalls, hiking, historical tours, etc. Or you can sit on the porch with a good book and watch the river roll by. Our room had a queen size bed with a fireplace, DVD/TV and a large/clean bathroom (w/ towels and some basic toiletries). For breakfast you have a choice of basic items - Omelets, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc. Try the blueberry pancakes if they have them - they are amazing! I highly recommend this B&B and I would definitely stay here again!", "title": "Great location & perfect B&B", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lolomojo", "date": "October 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5899559, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location & river views"}}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 20, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 113}, "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Historic, stately B&B is located 2 hours west of NYC.
