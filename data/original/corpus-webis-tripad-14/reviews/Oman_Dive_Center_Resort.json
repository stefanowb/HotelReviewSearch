My daughter recently wanted a 'beach birthday party' and we decided to try the Oman dive center. After a few emails back and forth between the admin staff and myself we finally devised a suitable party package that suited us. I use the term package very loosely as this place obviously is not used to hosting childrens birthday party functions and the communication back and forth by email was a little frustrating. However, we continued to persue this option and also decided that after the birthday party we would like to stay the night. Usually there is a minimum of 4 nights but the staff here were able to accommodate our request and we reserved 3 huts/rooms for 1 night only.", "title": "We didn't want to leave!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MuscatWally", "date": "September 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 81150039}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The party began and I was somewhat surprised by how well EVERYTHING went.

The beach is generally divided into two; one part for the day-trippers and the other for the hotel guests, in this way, hotel guests have lots of space on the beach and do not have to stay in the often crowded 'public part'. We stayed in a lovely barasti hut with comfy beds and a private outdoor bathroom - it was lovely to take a shower in the outdoor! However, the huts are generally tightly packed and guests may therefore be easily be disturbed by eachother. While the lunches at the Resort's restaurant were excellent, the breakfast and dinner buff\u00e9s which were included in the room rate were nothing but a disappointment! There was no possibility of ordering \u00e0 la carte, instead you had no other choice but to eat the buff\u00e9, which was mediocre at its best. We got the impression that the owners indeed had a vision and a sympathetic idea about how to run this place, but that these ideas actually were lost in translation and too many short-cuts were taken in almost every extent of running the Centre. Our stay was over the New Years Holiday, and we were forewarned that there would be a 'small party' at the Centre (mind you, it only has about 20-30 huts) and that we would have to pay extra for food and the party. When New Years Eve finally came, this 'small party' had suddenly emerged into a huge occassion with hundreds of paying guests and a hired dj who played dance music for hours on end on the beach a few hundred meters from the barasti huts. Although hotel guests were invited to attend (or rather, had no choice but to pay for this event), we found very few guests actually attending this noisy event and most guests, including us, felt disturbed rather than content about attending these festivities....", "title": "Very relaxing", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DubaiMike", "date": "September 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 81552600}], "location": {"country": "Oman", "region": "Muscat Governorate", "continent": "Middle East"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 22, "very good": 48, "terrible": 11, "excellent": 34}, "aka": "Oman Dive Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.133333333333}
