All hotel staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Room was very comfortable and reasonably clean. I say reasonably because laminate floor was gritty and kind of nasty. Walking on floor in socks left visible dirt / hair on feet...ewe!...... I would have expected a deeper cleaning of the room between customers. Faucet in sink was ajar. I told maintenance but no response while we were there. I'm surprised housekeeping has not reported issue as it was difficult to turn water on / off. Breakfast offerings were very basic, prepackaged pastries and bagels, fruit. On a 4 day stay, I would have liked to see a little variation and real milk or cream instead of powdered for coffee. 5th floor vending machine ripped us off for drinks a couple of times. Location was great. All in all, I would stay here again.... I appreciate the fact that the manager is commenting personally on most of the feedback posts. While some of my comments (and others) may seem 'nit picky' to some, the take away here is attention to detail.
