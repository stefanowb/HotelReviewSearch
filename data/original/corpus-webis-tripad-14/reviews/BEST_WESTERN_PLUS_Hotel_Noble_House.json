Suite was spacious, tastefully decorated, clean and luxurious. Two televisions were included which was a pleasant surprise, this little touch took the stress out of taking 2 children on a weekend break with spare time in the evenings. A cuddly toy was placed on one of the beds for the younger child to cuddle at night, with strict instructions to leave it for the next child. My daughter took great care to follow the instructions and was delighted to look after him for 2 days. Tea/Coffee facilities in the room. The only downside was the lack of air con - very hot in malmo last week. Reception staff were helpful and pleasant to deal with. Breakfast was excellent, typical scandanavian spread in nice open dining room. Internet access available in lobby. The most pleasant surprise was the central location of the hotel, located on Gustav Adolf torg and one street from Lilla Torg which is great for evening dining and people watching.
