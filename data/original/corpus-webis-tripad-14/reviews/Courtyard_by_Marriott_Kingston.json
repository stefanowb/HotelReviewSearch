This is my only complaint about Marriott in general, but seems to be the policy of the chain in general so I can't hold it against this hotel.

My idea is that the room has to be more than just a bed to crash in, as you never know when you'll be spending more time in the room than expected. Like today. We flew into LaGuardia yesterday from Palm Beach after a 2.5 delay; then took a ridiculously insane trek through Harlem, all the way up Broadway, across the GW Bridge into Jersey then finally onto the NY State Thruway (thanks to the wonderful new little GPS my kids got me for Christmas - I really miss my big brick Magellan that never mislead me) arriving at our destination - New Paltz - and what could be described as a trip equivalent to Mr Toad's Wild Ride (it wasn't operator error, I have an excellent sense of direction - just not in Manhattan :). My family are locals so, I've never paid for a room \"in town\" - New Paltz - other than during one of my few stays at what I could only describe as a resort that should be on everyone's \"bucket list\" - Mohonk Mountain House. The Marriott Courtyard is located in the Target/local mall parking lot; one exit north of New Paltz. Coming from South Florida, when somebody tells me that my hotel is one exit up, I think real close. However, these are \"country miles\", so the exits are about 20 miles apart. Regardless, the Marriott Courtyard is worth the trip, even if your business or day trip is in New Paltz. The staff has been most accommodating, the room is excellent - clean, well appointed, roomy, nice/big bathroom with my favorite - the curved shower curtain (sorry, I hate it when you spend your time in the shower trying to get a shower curtain unstuck from your body because they have a straight rod curtain holder), mini fridge, etc. The price of the breakfast buffet ($8.99 ?) doesn't kill you like some other properties. There is free wi fi and computers/printers located in the lobby (handy for printing boarding passes while traveling), very comfortable sitting area in the lobby, along with concierge service (who knew). I don't remember ever staying at a Courtyard, but this location has absolutely sold me on the brand. The room was pricey, I only booked a week in advance, but the manager cut me a break, because my room request had not been filled as reserved. The price might be high due to a popular car show (Good Guys?) being held in Rhinebeck and a horse show in Saugerties; or maybe its a little pricey because (from what a relatie told me) its the newest hotel in the area. The initial reservation price was higher than the hotel I will be staying at in Times Square in a couple of days; but again, that price dropped. Regardless, it's worth the price to stay in a room where you don't worry about cleanliness or safety. Location - right off the Thruway/other highways, so it's accessible. Let's get to today - son threw up this morning at breakfast, so I am getting to spend a little longer in the room than I ever expected (great argument for not staying in a dive); plus I could walk over to Target and buy cola syrup/pepto bismol, ginger ale, etc. Not exactly how I thought I would be spending one of four days in NY, but what can you do. Nobody expects to go on a trip and get sick. So, regardless - I will (without heistation) make the trek up one exit to the Marriott Courtyard if I ever need a hotel room when I'm visiting relatives - it's definitely worth it!", "title": "Our go-to place in the Hudson Valley", "user": "velocitytime", "date": "June 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 113571030}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here 4 nights for a local event.
