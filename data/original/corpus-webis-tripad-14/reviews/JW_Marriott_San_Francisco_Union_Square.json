I'm a frequent travler to San Fran and have stayed in many hotels all over the city and the Pan Pacific is one of my fav's. It's location is unbeatable - right off Union Square. It is a little less hetic being a block away from Union Square, but still very close, so within seconds you are in the middle of it all. I liked how the lobby was on the third floor; it made it very calm and away from the hustle of Post St. I enjoyed sitting by the fire in the lobby enjoying a drink. Our room was awesome, very large! The bed was wonderful, one of the best hotel beds. The bathroom was also awesome, with a separate shower and tub, all surrounded by black marble.

According to the Pan Pacific's rates, the cheapest room in the place is $340 per night, but we found a great all-inclusive deal that averaged out to about $100 per night. The service was above average, but not as excellent as all of the reviews that I had read. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially at the concierge desk. After a long travel day, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, and it took a little prompting on my part to speed up the process - which I shouldn't have to do. Everything else was extremely positive after that, though. The concierge was very helpful in booking us a rental car. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. It's not a huge room, but we weren't in our room very often anyways. Another note about the room - the street noise is pretty loud at times; I woke to the sounds of bottles being dumped into a bin from the lounge across the street and the ambulance/police sirens a few times as the windows are single-paned and don't keep out sound very well. The workout room on the 5th floor was nice, and it seemed to be getting regular use from the hotel guests. It was maintained very well. We didn't eat at the restaurant, and it didn't look as though it received a lot of business. The menu looked great, but was pricey. Housecleaning was fantastic! They really did a nice job each day on our room. The Pan Pacific is convenient for getting on the bus line and trolley lines. Most lines were 1-3 blocks away. Finally, I liked the 3rd floor lobby. It was a good choice for placing the lobby, as we didn't have to walk through crowds to get to our room. We could just bypass all of that with the elevator. By the way - the glass elevators are a nice touch! We will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific again. We encountered many other tourists at different SF sights asking us where we were staying, and they said that we were lucky to be there because of the reputation of the place. Plus, many others weren't enamored with their accomodations.
