We had double bed room on the 7th floor facing onto the street, but didn't find the street noise a problem. The room was perfect and the complemetary CD player with jazz CDs and selection of books was a nice touch. The large bathtub was a godsend after a day of sightseeing. So too was the 'Happy Hour' wine tasting each afternoon in the hotel bar! We found all the hotel staff very helpful and extremely friendly - we even received a thank you note from the maids each day for leaving them a tip.

We were very unhappy with this, especially as we had a bag stolen somewhere between the airport and the hotel and suspected it had happened while we were thus distracted. When I complained to the member of staff on the front desk he admitted that he was the doorman but had had a couple of things to 'wrap up' when he should have been helping us.
