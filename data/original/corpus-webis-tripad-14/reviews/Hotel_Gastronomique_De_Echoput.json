And we liked it very much: the modern architecture and styling of the rooms, the friendliness of the staff, the quiet surroundings (though the highway is quite nearby; didn't hear anything of it because our room was located at the back of the hotel). When we arrived, there was a bag of candy on one of the pillows for my daughter which was a very nice touch. The room itself was quite spacious (my spouse, daughter (in an extra bed at an extra charge btw) and me stayed in one room, but we had plenty of room left), very nice bathroom (liked the powerful shower). We made use of room service, that arrived quite swiftly and the food was quite nice (they made some very tasty french fries for my daughter). Having had dinner, we made use of the swimming pool. Although it is not a gigantic pool, we had great fun (had the pool for ourselves). If we had to complain, then it would be about the bed: it was far too soft for us. The next morning, we had breakfast which was quite nice. Went for a swim again, and then we checked out to go to Apenheul (nearby the hotel, just as Julianatoren). We paid around 260 Euros (the room itself was 129 Euros (which is a bargain, actually), the rest was for the extra bed, the room service and breakfast). Yes, maybe that's pricey (particularly the extras) but it was worth it. Had no problems with our cell phones btw.
