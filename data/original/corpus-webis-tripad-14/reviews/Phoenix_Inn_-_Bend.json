Some of this may be because they were being sold in spring 2006 (according to the staff), so it may be better now. Breakfast service at that time was real poor -- they were out of many things all 4 days we were there. The rooms were not real clean. The furniture was showing its age -- the chairs and desk ergonomics are horrible if you have to work in your room. All hotel pools have chlorine odor, but this seemed stronger than it should have been. And they need to replace the pool decking and bottom -- it's very rough and actually blistered my daughter's toes. On a bright note, the family suites are good if you have 2 kids, because there are 3 beds in 2 rooms.", "title": "Not what it once was", "user": "AnOregonian", "date": "September 17, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 5808239, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Family suite layout, location (is in downtown Bend)", "disliked": "\u2014 Breakfast, loud guests in other rooms, bad furniture, rooms not real clean, terrible pool."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have stayed here in the past and we try and stay here every visit. If you want to spend time in downtown this is the best location to stay. You can walk to everything. When I say walk, this is not like places I have stayed where they say you can \"walk to everything\" but you are expected to be an \"Olympic distance walker\". It\u2019s literally a 1-2 minute walk to a great restaurant at the old Fire House (Staccato). It\u2019s probably 3-4 minutes to make it all the way to Wall St. (Assuming you are a slow walker). Anyway, back to the hotel. The rooms are exactly what I expect for what we paid. Everything is clean and in good repair, but it's not a five star resort. There is no room service, there is no mini-bar, there are not rooms with what I consider a suite (separate living areas), but I am not the type of person that spends most of my time in the Hotel room. The room does have a mini-fridge so you can keep your leftovers and some bottled water on hand. I suggest asking for a room facing west, if you are on the 3rd floor, you will be able to see downtown and a nice Mountain View. I have always heard great things about the complimentary breakfast, but we do not get up very early and we have a few local spots we like to hit. (They are already too crowded or I would share here). So, in summary, you get what you pay for (that\u2019s not a bad thing) at this hotel and the location just cannot be beat. Try it out, but do not expect a $250/night hotel for less than $120/night.", "title": "Great Location/Good Price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shocked1", "date": "September 10, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5786661, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location is perfect", "disliked": "\u2014 play lots of Golf ;-)"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Just returned from spending 2 nights at the Phoenix Inn and loved it.

There are a bunch of chain motels on the horrible commercial strip on the highway leading into town, but we wanted to stay downtown so we could walk easily in the town. Finding a place wasn't easy; there aren't so many hotels/motels downtown, and the one we tried before the Phoenix Inn was all booked for several wedding groups (even on a Sunday night). Luckily, the Phoenix Inn accomodated us for a mere $159 per night for a small suite (would have been $179 without the AAA discount, which the desk clerk offered without us asking, to his credit). I guess Bend is popular this time of year, but the hotel is business-class and not what I would consider a luxury hotel. Actually, we would have taken a smaller room, but I think they were all booked. Other than the price, we really liked this hotel. The desk clerk was very helpful. We liked the fresh cookies at the front desk when we were checking in. The bed was good quality, just firm enough, and had a down comforter. All the usual business-class amenities were there (desk, iron and ironing board, etc.). Also, the location is good, just a couple blocks from downtown, although Bend is so small that you could probably hoof it into the downtown even if you stayed in one of the chain motels just outside of town.", "title": "Comfortable business-class, somewhat pricy", "user": "pbfarfallina", "date": "June 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8030345}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The Phoenix Inn has a decent location, close to the old downtown area of Bend just off of 97.
