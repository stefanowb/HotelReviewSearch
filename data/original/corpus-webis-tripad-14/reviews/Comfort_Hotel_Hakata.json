The Comfort Inns in the U.S. are not posh either, but this one has a motel-6 feel to it. I took a two-bed room, and the furnishing is strictly no-frills. But the wifi Internet connection works well, and the beds are comfortable. However, as I left the hotel, the door to a utility room next to the elevator was left open, and I caught sight of a shockingly shoddy floor with peeling vinyl coverings. It made me wonder about the upkeep of the hotel in general.
