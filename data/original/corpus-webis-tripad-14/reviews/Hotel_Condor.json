There were 4 of us - 2 couples. This hotel is run by a family and the staff are so friendly. They couldn't have helped you any better. We hired a car out so the moment we arrived at the hotel our car was driven to their own locked up car park which cost us an additional cost of \u20ac10 per night. They also delivered the car back to us whenever we needed it during the day. We had a room with an amazing view of the town of Taormina and seaside. We paid an additional cost of \u20ac8 per night for this room but it was well worth it. It had a small enough balcony but it was suffice for our stay here. The Hotel is only a 3 minute walk to the main shopping street of Taormina. The only downfall was that it had no pool but with the beach being so near we got the cable car there whcih brought us right to the beach front. The hotel recommended us to eat at a nearby restaurant the first night (sorry cannot think of the name of restaurant but it was on your right hand side of the street when you come out of the arch and just before sport shop). Our meal was ok- nothing to write home about and cost us \u20ac130 for 4 of us with 1 drink each and only starters and main course whcih was a bit of a ripoff.

I had read several reviews on Trip Advisor and in books which gave me high hopes that we were going to be in for a treat. Our major disappointment was the bathroom. It was so tiny - I promise it was no bigger than 3' X 3'! The water from the shower sprayed everywhere and soaked the floor - thank goodness there was a drain! But, it was annoying to step out of the shower into about an inch of water! And, the toilet leaked when you flushed it. The other disappointing thing was that the A/C went out at 1:30am one morning! So, we were a bit hot that night, even though we were able to open the window. Other than that, it was all okay.

A self-contained two bedroomed ground-floor flat a few yards from the hotel; you just have to walk over for breakfast or a drink on the terrace. The apartment was average, neither good nor bad. The main bedroom has air-conditioning (a bit noisy) and it`s got a small balcony from where you have a (limited) view of the sea. The apartment has got a washing machine which can be a good or bad thing depending on your point of view (all work and no play): we found it very useful. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and most spoke good English. Breakfast is the kind they bring to you in a basket - bread rolls, cheese, croissants, jam, that type of thing. All quite nice, although the orange `juice` tasted suspiciously like squash - didn`t bother us, though. The hotel have some sort of link with one of the lidos (la Pigne) in Mazarro and for 10 Euros per person you can have a sunbed for the day and transport to and from the beach (that alone saves you 3.50 each on the cable car).
