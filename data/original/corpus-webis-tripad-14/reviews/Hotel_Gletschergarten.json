The rooms are very tasteful and spacious, beds are comfortable, bathrooms completely modern and well-maintained, and the views from the balcony are worth the cost of the room. Also, the staff and owners are always courteous and helpful. The location is toward the end of the hotel/main street area in town which is a blessing. You don't get all of the commotion of staying closer in, yet it's easily close enough to walk anywhere in town. Check out the bakery across the street if you're looking for a cheaper lunch or some nice snacks. All in all, a great place to stay if you don't want to feel like you're in the heart of the commotion but want to have access to everything in town.", "title": "Stayed twice in last 8 years - still wonderful!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MountainLoversCt", "date": "August 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8505591, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Views, quality and spaciousness of room, friendliness of staff.", "disliked": "\u2014 If it matters - you have to pay for internet service."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We absolutely loved this charming hotel.
