My family stayed in other rooms as well so I got a good look at this place. The pool area is behind the property and quiet. The patio area out front for all the patrons is perfect for relaxing with your wine and cheese or breakfast and newspapers. The rooms are cozy but provide everything you need including wine glasses and refrigerator. The only downside I found was that our bed was fairly uncomfortable, they would definitely benefit from some cushy mattress covers. My uncle stayed in room #12 which closest to the patio area and he said he could hear everyone in the morning while they were eating breakfast and he was trying to sleep. Other than that I can find no problems with the service, location or in general. We walked to dinner (2 blocks) and ate at a great Mexican place called Pacifico and it was tasty.
