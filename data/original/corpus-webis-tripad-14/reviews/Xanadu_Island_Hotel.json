Its a really lovely hotel but I am not sure about \"high class\" and is about one hour from the airport. The hotel is huge with all of the suites overlooking the sea and based around a courtyard. The staff are wonderful, cannot do enough for you and all are extremely friendly. We had a huge room with the largest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel. The hotel is absolutely spotless. It has the most amazing views all the way around the island. The food is plentiful and has a great choice. It is all buffet though, I think it would have been nice to have evening meal as \"a la carte\" sometimes. We went to the Italian restaurant one night and this was very good. I never saw anybody in the \"seafood restaurant\", probably because you had a to pay for this. I think they would be better off if they made this part of the all inclusive option.
