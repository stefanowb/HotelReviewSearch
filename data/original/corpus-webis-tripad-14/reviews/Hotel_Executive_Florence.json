We were very suprised to find that the front door was not being used due to construction. We were sent in via a side fire exit door. The reception dest was a bunch of card tables with a sheet over them. The constuction was very noisy and bothersome. The bell - hop said it would be going on for another year! Not only that, but the room was extremely small, the carpets were disgusting and the bathroom was not clean according to my standards! I would strongly recommend not staying here, there are too many other hotels in Florence! The only good points were the location, and the service!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "tricianeff", "date": "October 4, 2004", "id": 2619219}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Horrible Hotel", "text": "Horrible, Stained carpets, stained bedspread, cigarette butts on terrace with apt clothesline overhead.
