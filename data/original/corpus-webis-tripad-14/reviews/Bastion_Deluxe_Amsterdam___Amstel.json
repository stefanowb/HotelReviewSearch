The negatives are 1) the broken showerhead that leaked and sprayed water all over the bathroom floor, but not so much in the tub; 2) the dirty towels from the previous guest(s) that were left on the bathroom floor (which we informed the reception desk about on our way out to sightsee and still found when we got back 7 hours later); 3) the disgusting, visibly stained bed covers and carpeting; and 4) the lack of soundproofing which made every passing train from the tracks across the street and car on the nearby highway audible. The gas station, which is literally at the hotel's front doorstep, is convenient, but adds nothing to the hotel's external aesthetic.
