We had searched every resort in our price range in the Riviera Maya before deciding on this one and we couldn't be happier with our decision. I should first say that we went during the off season which I think made things a little easier. There was still a good amount of people for entertainment but there were no issues with over crowding. We arrived early and were able to check-in as soon as we got there. We were also able to pick the building we wanted. We choose 3521 so it was half way between the lobby and the beach, overlooking the pool. We never had problems with getting a lounge chair at the beach or the pool. We stayed for 6 nights which guaranteed 2 dinner reservations but we were actually able to book the specialty restaurants every night. The rooms were clean, cool and spacious. There was cable TV with some English channels plus regular hotel amenities. The pool was huge and active. It was warm, not very refreshing and towards the end of the day got a little slimy, but not enough to really matter. The food is good, nothing outstanding but I don't think any all inclusive places have excellent food. At one place or another food and drinks were available 24-7. The service was excellent, there was on-site shopping and entertainment. The Paraiso Beach is 1 of 5 connecting resorts. The Beach shared Del Mar, the 3 other resorts are upgrades but from I what saw, not worth it. I loved every bit of the trip and would definitely recommend it and will be returning myself.", "title": "Great Sandy Beach and Huge Pool", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "bookangel08", "date": "September 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117710527}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I have been to the Mayan Riviera 4 times and this was a really great resort for friends and family at an excellent price .

Positives: There is a lot to do, a lot of room around the pool and the beach, rooms are kept up pretty well, the beach and waves are great!, had a blast in the water. Some negatives according to OUR experience: no tub in room, resort is TOO big - it is a chore to go anywhere and you have to plan it because there is no quick way to get back to your room, I think I rode the \"trolley\" once during my whole week stay - it is never around, my family members had trouble calling out - the phone card they had was blocked by the hotel - they made you purchase their's, the nightclub is very far away because there are 4 resorts on this property, however the nightclub was a blast!", "title": "Average All-Inclusive, a few good things", "user": "mcinar", "date": "August 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 116782967}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Hope this helps, I always try to be honest and objective when giving reviews.
