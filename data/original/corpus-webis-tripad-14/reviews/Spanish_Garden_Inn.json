This hotel and the staff were totally and absolutly brilliant. Everyone was very firendly and helpful, in particular Aarron, who carried our very large and heavy cases to/from our car with a smile. The hotel provide a complimentary breakfast and newspaper, which is very rare in hotels in the USA and every day in reception there are fresh chocolate chip cookies for guests. In the reception they have a huge book for guests to peruse listing several local restaurants & giving details of the menus & prices, so it is easy to decide where to go before leaving the hotel. Excellant value for money and we cannot wait to visit again & stay longer next time.
