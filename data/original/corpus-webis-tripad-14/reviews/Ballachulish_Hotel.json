We also ate in the hotel and both really liked our evening meal top marks - on the second night went to the 'Holly Tree' down the road and we were disappointed, it was ok but made me wish i'd stayed for dinner at the hotel. Breakfast had plenty of choice however we're not keen on the help yourself to the hot breakfast, i dont think it would be much to make the cooked breakfast to order - we have had this at other hotels (smaller family run-which means that its not the chef making the breakfast) anyway it was ok and thats probably just personal choice.
