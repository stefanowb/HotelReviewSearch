The robes were very light and not very comfortable compared to other hotel robes we have used in the past but better than nothing.

It is an extremely busy street with buses, large trucks, and motorcyles/cars (often with radios blaring) constantly going by in large number from very early in the morning until evening. We live in Manhattan--we are used to loud! This street made our NYC street seem downright quiet and peaceful in contrast! I highly, highly suggest that you bring earplugs--if you need quiet to sleep this is not the place. The street does slow down in the evening, but it starts again very early the next morning! Perhaps the rooms off of Broughton (of which there are few) are more quiet, I don't know. If you get one of the 2nd floor rooms with viranda you'll be gazing down at the before-mentioned busy street and an H&R Block, cellular phone store, etc. directly across the way.
