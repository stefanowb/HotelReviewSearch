Other reviewers have said it all really. Bright,modern,clean,comfortable,warm,great shower and bath, lovely breakfast,helpful friendly staff,lovely little outside decking area and garden (would be great in the summer!) and great value. Loaction is fab just a 5 min walk into the centre of town. The only negative is the lack of parking. They have a small \"carpark\" round the corner which is busy and didn't appear particulaly well lit so wouldn't have fely too happy to leave the car there, fortunately at the weekends you can park on the street outside on sundays and evenings between 6pm and 8am so we did that.", "title": "Great place to Stay,close to town centre + lovely breakfast", "user": "Norwich_Tractor_Boy", "date": "December 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 89568385}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Bury is a great town we had a top night out.

Owners very accommodating of our request to put our 2 small children (Aged 2 & 5) in our bedroom on campbeds - no other hotel or B&B that I called would consider this! Even with the campbeds we had ample room (Room 8). Bedrooms and all public areas were spotlessly clean, it looked like it had all been given a fresh coat of paint. Bright neutral rooms, modern, functional decor. (I've not ticker the 'no frills' as I think it's so much nicer than that, but it's not a cosy, period, feature property) All rooms had ensuite bathroom, ours had a free standing power shower (I have no idea if any of the rooms have baths, rather than showers?) Free Wi-fi in all bedrooms, Tea/coffee making facilities, ample hangers in the wardroobe, chest of drawers, iron and ironing board in the room.", "title": "A little Gem!", "user": "daiseeeee", "date": "July 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70119059}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 14, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 18}, "aka": "St Edmunds Guest House Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk", "slim_ranking": 0.377049180328}
