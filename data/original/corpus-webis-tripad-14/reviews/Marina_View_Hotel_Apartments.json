We asked for extra towels and were told we were ony allowed two since there was two of us. We asked for an extra room key since sometimes my friend and I wanted to go to different places or come back at different times. First we were told they did not have any extra keys to come back tomorrow. When we did come back we were told we were only allowed one key. This was very inconveniant and I have never come across this at any hotel I have stayed at. They are very unhelpful with any requests so just dont bother. Esp a gentleman called Michael who we found to be very condescending and plain rude. If it wasnt for the staff we would definately stay here again as its a nice hotel and perfect location however we have been completely put off by the rude and unhelpful front desk staff.
