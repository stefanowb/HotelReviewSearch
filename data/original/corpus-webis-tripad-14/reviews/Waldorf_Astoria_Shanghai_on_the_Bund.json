Im usually a Park Hyatt or Four Seasons fan, but was in the hotel for an event. The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed with all the automatd blinds and heated self flushing toilets one would expect in Asia. The food is pretty good - though i have had better breakfast buffets. The fluffy slippers would get a 5 star rating ! The housekeeping / room servicing was great and the concierge very helpful. I had a major disaster with the laundry. They ruined an expensive evening gown, then when trying to rectify the situation actually made it even worse by creating stains tht were not present before. This can happen, howver in 5 star hotel you expect more care. The way that the management then dealt with this issue compounded my disappointment as it was a clear attempt to side step responsibility and to try to put the blame on the guest.
