It was recommended by friends and we couldn't have been more pleased. The buildings were built in the fifties but they have been very well kept and appear to have been recently remodeled. The hotel is located on the side of a hill overlooking downtown Morelia. All the large rooms and suites are different. Each has a fireplace which proved useful on cool evening. The staff are friendly and accomodating. The restaurant is pretty good but there are many excellent restaurants near by, including the top-of-the-line Villa Montana across the street. The only glitch we experienced was a problem with the water pressure in our first room. When we mentioned it to the office they immediately investigated and upgraded us to a suite. I have never had a better response to a problem in any other hotel. If you find yourself in Morelia, Mexico, do yourself a favor and try the Villa San Jose.", "title": "Lovely hotel in a lovely city", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "EB3", "date": "May 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5068244}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A wonderful stay...I'll be back!", "text": "My fiance and I recently spent a weekend at the Villa San Jose.......and we both thought it was wonderful. And from the two of us you are getting two perspectives. I am from the United States, and she from Mexico, a Tapatia from Guadalajara. The view of Morelia, from the windows of our room, and from the restaurant were both fantastic, and there is also a small nightclubm for gthering in the evening for music and drinks.

It is located directly across the street from the Villa Montana in the hills above Morelia, and is priced less. The views were unbelievable, particularly from the restaurant. The grounds were beautiful and quiet.We stayed in a two bedroom suite with our three children. The rooms were decorated in the traditional Mexican style, and there was a fireplace in each room.The bedrooms were very large. The bathrooms, although adequate, were on the small side.The Villa San Jose has a pool, which was great for the kids. The restaurant serves breakfast buffet style (with mostly traditional Mexican foods), as well as lunch and dinner. They will serve meals poolside if requested.The staff was helpful and informative. There is internet access (free). Taxis into Morelia cost $2.50 US , and it is a short ride.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "colcor5", "date": "August 7, 2003", "id": 1217073}], "location": {"country": "Mexico", "region": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 4, "very good": 13, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 23}, "aka": "Hotel San Jose", "slim_ranking": 0.0645161290323}
