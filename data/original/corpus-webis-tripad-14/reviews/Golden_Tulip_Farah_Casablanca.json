In almost all aspects, it's a 5*hotel: spa, swimming-pool, parking, jazz bar, piano bar, excellent breakfast, excellent room, excellent bed, clean toilet, calm, decent room service,internet... Drawbacks? It's noisy as hell though its double screen windows due to its location in the heart of a busy rond-point of the city. Internet was not running very efficiently and there's only 2 pc's downstairs. As for the staff, well, this is Morocco? It all looks really good but when you scracth a little, there's nothing behind. Same old stories instead of sharp YES or NO. The computer room technician left \"faire des affaires\" and we were told he was due back in 20minutes. 2 hours later he still wasn't back. After some thorough investigation, no one had a clue where he was or had been. Thus, it was a useless typical getaway lie to say he was due back in 20 minutes. He wasn't due back. that was the right answer in teh first place. These things can get on your nerves in the long run, but it still doesn't change the fact that it's a very good option for CASABLANCA having tried others.", "title": "Excellent quality/price rate though still a long way to go.", "user": "PETERParis", "date": "December 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 121655748}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Total inability of the staff to communicate", "text": "I stayed at this hotel for a business trip and it was truly one of the worst hotel experiences I have had.

Also had problems connecting to the internet, which is essential for me during business travel. The staff were surly and didn't even bother to listen to what I was saying half the time.

I mentioned that my TV did not work and somebody came up and fixed it within minutes. There is also a beautiful entrance hall with lots of space where you can sit or meet, the rooms are clean and the beds are good, the hot water comes instantaneously etc. So what if the view out of the hotel window on a very dreary Casablanca (even in the sun) is not very inspiring, give the hotel the credit that it deserves.
