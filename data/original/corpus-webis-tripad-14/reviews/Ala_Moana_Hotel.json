Minimal waiting time for lifts and wide hallways gives a pleasant spacious ambience. Our room was compact, but for very clean and comfortable. We were travelling with our 20 year old daughter, and with all our shopping, still managed to enjoy our room. Loved having breakfast on the generous lanai. Never needed to draw the curtains, so experienced magnificent views morning and evening. The pool was closed for renovation during most of our stay, but was finished a few days before leaving. Beautiful renovations and were surprised how large and well equipped the pool area was. The facilities are absolutely fabulous, with state of the art gymnasium, sauna and steam room.
