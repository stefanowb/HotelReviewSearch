The hotel is located on a great part of the beach though walking from where the restaurants and bars were at 3 Am between 5th street to 1 street does not seem to be the safest. I thought the Ocean Drive restaurant theme carried all the way down to the Marriott. It Does not. I grew up in NY so I am comfortable with areas but ladies in my opinion keep an eye out. The hotel was nice but 35,000 point per night questionable. One a South Beach not I was surprised that everywhere you eat and drink they include gratuity. So at the Marriott a beer and virgin pina colada with tax and tip $24. The one thing I found disappointing was the outside lounge area where the fire pit tables were is disgusting IE very dirty ( left over glasses, butts on the ground ). The lounge chairs and cushions are FILTHY - Did I say Filthy. Not what I have experienced at my many other Marriott trips. . Would I stay there again yes just at $400 a night they need to fix some things for that rate with a view of the ally and hotel next door. For some recommendations. The Tides hotel on I believe 17th and Ocean. You must go there for drinks and appetizers EXCELLENT!!!!!!! - The Miami mojito my wife had with Vodka was the best I have ever tasted anywhere from NY - LA. Trust me you will not be disappointed. 3 amazing appetizers 1 mojito, 1 beer , 1 avian water . $65 Tax and tip included. And for entertainment right next door was an obvious gay mens outdoor bar called the Palace bar. It was pounding with great music and a interesting transgender sidewalk show. . On the diner side we at A Fish Called Avalon in the Avalon hotel. Excellent again but a bit dark i could not read my menu !! . Mango's a must see. If there girls dancing are not Ex strippers then they have that butty shaking dancing down pat. The Bar tender guys are to full of themselves.

Let me begin by saying that searching for a good hotel in south beach is a daunting task, especially if one is not familiar with the area. Even though I am a Miami local, South Beach was not too familiar to me and I was very unsure about what area and hotel would suit us/me best. I started my search on priceline and tried to bid on a 3.5 and 4 star hotel in the general area where I wanted to stay. However, everyone of my bids were rejected. I noticed that as the weekend was approaching, many of the \"nicer\" hotels were getting all booked. I was worried that I would not be able to treat my sister to a relaxing weekend on the beach. I probably reviewed every review on the top hotels in the area and was always surprised by the number of negative comments even for what were considered luxury hotels and ones that commanded $300+ per night (not including taxes, resort fee, parking) . Being a top-tier member at Hilton and Marriot, I decided to contact those hotels directly because that was what I was familiar with. I called Marriott South Beach and spoke with Alex Blanco. To make a long story shorter, he was able to book a room for us on very short notice for a reasonable price. It was more than I wanted to pay but less than what was advertised. At this point, I was thankful that I was able to secure a hotel room on south beach for the weekend.", "title": "Nice hotel...terrible service", "user": "campbfh2", "date": "July 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 115962893}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed at the Southbeach Marriott recently (Aug. 15-19th, 2011) for a solo ocean getaway. I had stayed at this hotel during prior visits (among others) to Southbeach and was aware of its location on the beach. Wanting a beach getaway with lots of ocean view, I knew this was the place to go. Located directly on the beach (separated only by dunes), on the southern end of SoBe. (there are ocean front hotels on the northern part of Sobe, which are very nice, but many of them don't have balconies). The ocean views from the balconies of the direct ocean view rooms are magnificent. I was unable to get a high floor room initially, but after staying in a lower floor room overnight and speaking with front desk staff the next day, they were able to move me into a higher floor room with direct ocean view (which I had reserved). The low floor direct ocean view rooms are good as well (view good), but the proximity to the outside terrace of the restaurant/loung/bar area exposes one to loud music from 6:00 a.m. until after midnight. So if you're trying to escape the constant thumping of the music, move upstairs. The rooms are not very large but certainly sufficient; beds are very comfortable (with no ugly bedspreads!). Room had everything one needs, including (for the ladies) a make-up mirror in the bathroom (even though I noticed my initial lower floor room did not have one). Rooms have a small refrigerator, so you can bring home (to the hotel room) some fruits and such and keep them cool; I prefer that over a mini-bar. Staff was very friendly. Restaurant was very accomodating to my low salt diet when asked. The Blue Deco Bar in the hotel serves one of the best Mojitos I've ever had (not cheap but definitely worth it). The pool is ocean front (and split into two pools of the same size). They are not very large, but the view of the ocean is very nice and the lounge chairs are lovely. Towels provided in the pool area. There are lounge chairs and towels available at the beach in front of the property, but at a charge. It's o.k. to bring your own beach towel, though and lay in the sand. Southe Pointe Park is a short walk away (to the South of the hotel) and is lovely; worth the walk over there. Also an automated bike rental station (DekoBike) is a block to the north and from there you can ride a bike and drop it off at many DekoBike stations in Southbeach. Nice convenience. It's lovely to bike around Southbeach, especially along the beachfront trails. Highly recommended activity. Overall I had a good experience at the Southbeach Marriott and would stay there again. Kudos to the Loss Prevention Department for promptly mailing me my favorite pair of white pants I forgot to pack when I left the hotel!!
