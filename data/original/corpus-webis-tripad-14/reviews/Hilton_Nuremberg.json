I would not recommend anyone to stay here if you want to be close to Nuremberg city centre, as you have to get a train from the station down the road from the hotel or get a taxi to the town. The Hilton is actually next to a sports complex and a large outdoor swimming pool, which is open from June until September. There is a cafe and shop next to the outdoor pool area and a few convenient cafes and service stations within walking distance, but you must go into the town for anything more. The rooms at this Hilton are basic, but stylish and spacious and bathrooms come with nice Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries. The breakfast buffet was very good and at least my expensive room rate came with breakfast included. Not to be missed here is the comfortable cocktail bar, which stayed open until around 5am over Rock Im Park weekend, but on normal days it is open until 1am at weekends, depending on how busy it is. There is an outdoor patio area open in the Summer and food it served until late. The bar manager has worked at the hotel for years and has cocktail techniques that are well-known around Nuremberg and many celebrities in town have had drinks here.", "title": "Perfect location for Rock Im Park music festival!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "SophieCalifornia", "date": "June 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 16833135, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great location for where I had to go and good leisure facilities", "disliked": "\u2014 They doubled the room rates over that weekend because of an event, it was overpriced"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "There is a well-equiped gym, large unisex sauna and large indoor pool inside the hotel leisure club as well as the outdoor pool next door.

Nuremberg is a medium sized city with a lot to offer but we came for the Christmas Market -- and we have been to a lot of them in Europe but there is none better! The food and hot wine (blueberry) is the best we've had -- anywhere!. The hotel is located about 3 miles from the city center but getting there is super easy in a cab or you can take the bus 44 which stops adjacent to the hotel parking lot (an outside lot that is free to hotel patrons). We like this hotel and it would have graded higher were it not for an instance of a cranky attitude we saw in the lounge from a waiter who -- by the way needed some hygeine tips. We frustrated him I guess as he wanted us to go eat in the restaurant; I guess because we had our teenagers with us;t we did notice a family with small children in there, already seated. So, we had a timeout, sat at the bar and waited about 15 minutes for Mr Attitude to get us table in the two thirds empty lounge. But the food was good ... and we enjoyed the evening. The breakfast is really nice and the service is outstanding. I saw more attention at this breakfast by staff than I have seen anywhere in years. They were 'swarming us'; making sure we had coffee, clean plates, etc ... The food was very good too and there was a lot of it. I would say this was one of the rare places that is worth the money for the buffett breakfast. However, after getting a deal from the hilton website, it was included in the price. If you get the deal you are looking for, stay here. If not and the prices are similar, stay downtown near the city center. And make sure you go during the holiday season cause the Christmas Market is worth the trip alone.", "title": "Good Deal", "user": "J C", "date": "December 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 51549399}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "A typical Hilton with good people - very good people - Soccer, tennis, skating makes a fun place.

No free internet - must stay in a cheaper hotel to get that? Right? Free bike sowe rode around and had beer and food. German's enjoy talking and are great company.

And if you can get a deal (like we did, booked in January for a July stay), you can get a deal on what is, really, a very nice, super comfortable hotel. The rooms are large, impeccably clean, very comfortable and modern, with every amenity you could want. The front desk is very helpful (very apologetic when one of our rooms wasn't ready when we arrived-- they blamed in on a visiting football team, of course-- but still, it took them what seemed a good bit of time to rectify the situation. Unlike other Europen facilities, this hotel does not seem to be as fully staffed as it might; blame it on American management, perhaps). So, the hotel itself is great-- especially if you don't pay full price! But what diferentiates it is the amazing breakfast buffet, which has row upon row of hot & cold possibilities beckoning to you in the morning. If you can get a package with breakfast included-- by all means, do so! Location is on the outskirts of town, so it takes a few minutes to get to the old city, if you're driving.
