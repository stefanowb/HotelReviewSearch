We couldn't have been more pleased. The location was impossible to beat. You could see Castle Hill and the Charles Bridge from the hotel and virtually everything was within walking distance. The hotel itself was also superb. The rooms were clean and large and apparently the windows were soundproof because when they were closed you heard nothing from outside. The breakfast (included) was a buffet of typical European foods. Good and good choices. But one of the best things was the attitude of the staff. They were so helpful with every request. If you wanted to use the subway, specific and clear directions were given. Looking for a specific tour? They knew them all. They helped arrange dinner reservations for 10 on the evening we arrived and had suggestions for everything. Marek, especially was good. Other hotels should send their staff to him for training on how to treat their guests. The young lady (her name slips my mind) who helped us plan our stay was also wonderful. Transportation between the airport and hotel was available and punctual.

And the best experience I've had. They are almost like friends. Every question is responded with care, and they are knowledgeable! When I left, I was sad. The location is perfect, the center of the city is 10-15 at foot, crossing Charles Bridge...The food is awesome, loved the breakfest and I ate often in the evening there. Also, the staff are all attentive whereas it's Ondrej, Marek or Mario. The rooms are large, this hotel simply put is a GEM ! The staff is always caring, it shows why they won a price at trip advisor, when I'll get back to Prague it's no brainer, I'll be staying at Charles Bridge. And if you'd like to do the same then book in advance, because they are popular! Indulge yourself, Praha : Mam te rad !!!!

Bathroom was small, but had everything we needed, with a good shower and ample hot water. Only negative was the sachets of bath products, would have been nice to have a few more or better quality. Breakfast was fine, plenty hot and cold selections, cold meats and cheeses, however no fruit to speak of. Also Coffee was from a dispenser machine, when fresh would have been nicer.
