Great balcony room - we couldn't stop going out on it to see the stunning and magical views. Easy walk to the ferry (12 Euros each for an all day pass). Visited Bellaggio and Varenna. Highly recommend both. The ferry runs every half hour so it's simple to follow and shouldn't be missed. The whole hotel is beautiful - even the halls have hand painted floral designs, thick carpeting and shiny shoe polishers, The rooms are all super upgraded, very comfortable and quiet. Lots of built in closets, a safe and a refrigerator. The restaurant is absolutely lovely, with great lake views, terrific polished wait staff and wonderful food. The buffet breakfast included fresh hot bread and rolls, brie, salami choices, fresh fruit, home made jams, croissants and danishes, hard boiled eggs, pears and peaches in juice, and more. You will definitely be very impressed. We made little sandwiches for the road and they worked out well.

This maybe a factor to consider if you encounter a rainy day at Lake Como and sightseeing at such picturesque locations may not be as enjoyable.
