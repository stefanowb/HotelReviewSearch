Our room was large and clean and reasonably comfortable, with a large Kingsize bed with linen changed every day. On the downside, we had no balcony (most rooms do) just a small window (this a result of stupid architectural external facade design); but that did mean that we had the extra space within the room. It's the details that let it down - e.g. no hairdryer in the room (but available), just 3 hangers in the wardrobe, the in-room safe disabled by removal of the lock, the room door electronic card lock intermittently failing to work. But the mini-bar worked and kept our wine and water nicely chilled. The bathroom was OK, but again failing on details - e.g. cheap plastic broken lavatory seat, dripping tap, occasional brown bath/shower water (just let it run for a while).", "title": "Terrible!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Nicole183", "date": "October 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 142881576}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Outside, the hotel has plenty of outdoor terrace space - but very limited seating in order to enjoy it.
