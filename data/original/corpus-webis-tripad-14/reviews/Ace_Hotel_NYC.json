My beau LOVED this \u2013 I on the other hand, being a girl who doesn\u2019t get her hair wet every day, had to work out some odd bathing logistics. So, I am noting this as something for the hair-minded to be aware of. I am not sure if every room has a shower like this, so if you don\u2019t want to get your head wet (or bend like a contortionist when you shower to avoid getting your head wet) \u2013 you may want to call ahead and see if there are any alternate options (otherwise make friends with a good quality shower cap). My only other \u201cgirlie\u201d observation is that the rooms (and bathroom) are a bit dark with very few lighting options \u2013 which is all very fine and awesome up until the moment when you want to get dressed and maybe even apply some make-up.
