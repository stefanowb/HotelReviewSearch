I wish we'd stayed longer. For the 50 euros we paid, we got a modern, clean, room, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, the most relaxing bathtub I have ever bathed, free internet, and the most charming, gracious and accomodating staff I've seen in quite some time. The hotel is quite old but was recently refurbished, apparently with a trip to IKEA, and is now decorated in cream and brown with orange and red accents. There is a lounge and bar area and the rooms are located upstairs. The bathtub is amazing - there is even a place to rest your elbows while you are reading!!!", "title": "Unbeatable value, Fanatstic bed and bathtub, perfect location, incredible staff", "user": "PT1976", "date": "April 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27743359}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled solo", "text": "The hotel is located right by the Plaza Espolon, which is the town center, and by Calle Laurel, where all the tapas bars are located.

I followed hotel signs around the streets and when I walked in front of this place, I could tell this was where I wanted to be. Entrance is cool, designer, and inviting. No fuss check-in led to room which was very \"hotelish\" (glasses all marked stterilised and 6 TV channels on old TV) but fine: clean, functional, and everything worked. Bathtub was not big so if you like a good bathtub ask for one in case they have one and couples should make sure bed is set up as a double as my was two singles but as I was alone this was OK. Copious brekfast and you are very well located for restuarants, bars, etc. there is an English newstand some 400 metres away that carries economist and Herald Tribune and teh main square and market nearby.", "title": "Likely the best breakfast on the Camino", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "elmstrasse", "date": "March 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14662063, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, quality of facilities, helpful staff"}}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "La Rioja", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Logrono"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 19, "very good": 92, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 46}, "aka": "Marques De Vallejo Logro\u00f1o", "slim_ranking": 0.235294117647, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}}
