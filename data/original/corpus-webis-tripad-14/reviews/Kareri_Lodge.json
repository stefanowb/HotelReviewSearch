The hotel was located in the good area. I stayed the most expensive room. The room was fairy big and had fantastic view. However, the bath was not so clean and shower was not powerful enough, so I saved the water in the bucket and cleaned the body everyday. If you are not in the top room, you may have better shower, as the boiler is not too close. Anyway, you can have nice view from other room, too. Just the balcony is smaller than the top room.", "title": "good manager", "user": "churachura", "date": "April 12, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 61101839}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010", "text": "We also used the laundry, but one t shirt was distroyed.
