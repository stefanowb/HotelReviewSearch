We traveled all over the concession in the early morning and the late afternoon, loving every minute ot it.

The charter flight takes us directly to Satara Airstrip inside the Kruger National Park. As soon as exiting the plane, we were immediately greeted by a Singita staff (December was his name, it'll be hard to forget such a name!).

There are no plunge pools here, which suprised us. We were two of three guests at the Lodge, so we had a lot of attentive service. The food and wines were superb. The management was really accomodating. They did some nice things for honeymooners, such as a dinner on our terrace by candlelight and a champagne bubble bath. Another night we had dinner in a boma with dancers. The spa is tiny, but the treatments were really good. The prices compare to those in the States. Our tracker Xipho and ranger Dale were wonderful and warm.
