Town looks like it was stuck in the 60's but the beach itself is the big draw. Beautiful sunsets, great shell collecting for kids... but hotel itself is pretty rundown and in dire need of renovation. Furnishings in unit were really old, pull out couch unuseable due to broken springs etc but kitchen well stocked and unit large. Bring your own towels, these were so old and threadbare I would rather use to dry off my car not my body. Front desk help soooo nice and helpful and I don't agree with statement about not kid-friendly. They were so nice to my son we never had any problems. Lots of kids there. Had basketball court and volleyball on beach which was nice. All places down there seem pretty much the same, older and rundown but the beach is the main attraction anyway.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "janaldo007", "date": "November 10, 2006", "id": 6101521}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Treasure Island"}, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 8, "very good": 24, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 16}, "aka": "Sand Pebble Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.363636363636}
