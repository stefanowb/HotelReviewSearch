We booked a Plantation Villa which was just lovely. The room was very clean although there wasn't alot of space to store suitcases etc . The hotel is of industrial style and was done throughout the hotel in a trendy but thoughtful way. The hotel adult pools are just fantastic, one has a swim up bar which is really nice and there were of sunbeds so no rush to get to the pool after breakfast. We ate in all the different restaurants, Black Ginger (thai) was very good and reasonably priced, the Rivet Grill (mostly meat menu) was absolutely amazing but abit pricey too! The Tin Mine offer ala carte dining or buffet, both were excellent and reasonably priced. There is also an indoor bar where you can play pool/snooker/watch English footie on tv! this was great for a bit of chill out time / pre-meal drinks. The staff at this hotel are wonderful and are so friendly and helpful. My advice would be to book trips through the hotel concierge not through the Thomsons rep, ours would have sold us anything! The hotel offered better priced and quality deals. Moos Kitchen (cookery course) was a great experience, we learnt alot and really enjoyed it (we chose programme 2 which is 4 hours where you prepare food, cook then eat what you've prepared). I would highly recommend this and it was good value. We booked our Phi Phi Island Hopper trip through the Thomson rep, if you don't like boats it's not for you (an hr between islands, not 10 mins which is how he sold it to us!). That cost about \u00a385 per person, was a full day trip with lovely bbq lunch included. It was a good trip (not to be missed but The Beach was abit disappointing becase it's such a tourist trap there were swarms of people everywhere). I would also recommend Mamamia for food on the beach, it's lovely even if you are reluctant to eat at beach shacks as I was, it was very good quality. Save yourself the taxi fare going to Phuket town though, it's smelly, tatty and you are harrassed the whole time by people trying to sell you stuff.
