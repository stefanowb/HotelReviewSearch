She saw a special offer on Travelzoo for discounted rooms at the Inn at Essex and we signed on for two cooking classes. We were totally impressed with the Inn at Essex. The staff, the food served in their two restaurants, and the cooking classes were outstanding! We found a professional staff, clean and comfortable room, and fantastic training kitchen for our cooking classes. If you love to cook or want to learn more about cooking, then check out the Inn at Essex and the New England Culinary Institute located there. I've been to other cooking schools, but they tend to be overcrowded. They limit the class size to 6 here, which is perfect. Everyone can participate hands-on, ask many questions of the instructor, and have a lot of fun learning, cooking, and eating! I highly recommend the Inn at Essex and will return there this spring, for sure!", "title": "An Inn For Foodies!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "daverrco", "date": "December 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 11633995, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The food is outstanding!", "disliked": "\u2014 A bit expensive...but it IS worth it!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We purchased an AARP show package that included a cooking class and 2 nights in an upgraded (ie gas fireplace) room for approx $300.00. The cooking class was great fun (and we learned a great deal), the food at all meals was creative and delicious (which I would expect from culinary students), and the staff was helpful and accommodating. The room was beautifully decorated, had a good closet, and was on the larger side. Some nice touches, such as Green Mountain coffee in the morning, hot cider at night, and an Internet connection in the lobby. One word of caution, however. Check ahead of time to confirm all charges: On checking out, we were charged an extra $41 as a gratuity to the cooking teacher. When I questioned this, the charge was removed. When I got home and rechecked the bill, I noticed a discrepancy between the 'show' price and what I had actually been charged.

Fortunately, on arrival the desk staff provide instructions for getting to Burlington and for finding your way back to the hotel. Six years later the food is still excellent but there are places where the hotel is showing its age. The elevator looks tatty and the air-conditioning unit in our room was corroded (although it worked perfectly). Also the extractor fan in the bathroom didn't work and this fault was not rectified even though we reported it. However, these minor faults did not spoil our stay. The food and service were as good as we remembered them to be from six years ago. The room was clean and tidy.
