The hotel is cute and modern-looking, with kitchenettes in the rooms. It looks like someone may have spruced up a converted dorm to be a hotel? It was located in comfortable walking distance of the war memorials, etc. HOWEVER, on our second night, there was an absolutely raucous party going on two doors down from us. We let things go until 1 a.m., and then called down to the front desk. Nothing happened. We called again at 2, nothing happened. The front desk guy said, \"I told them to be quiet, what else do you want me to do?\" but we could hear every moment of that party, and no one ever came up and so much as knocked on their door. At 3 a.m. I had to go down myself and insist that we be given a room on a different floor. The front desk guy then had the gall to suggest that we pack up all our stuff and move everything to the new room, or else be out of the new room early in the morning. I told him he was crazy if he thought we would do either, and if he didn't have the management skills to handle an out-of-control party than he should call the police or be apologizing profusely, not making demands on us. We went to sleep in a different room on another floor, and sure enough at 7 a.m. the management banged on the door to wake us up. It was utterly unacceptable for anyone, and given that my sister's whole wedding reception and room block was there you would think that they would be extra considerate.
