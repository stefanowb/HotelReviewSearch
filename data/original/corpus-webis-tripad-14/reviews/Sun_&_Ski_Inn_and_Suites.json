We needed a room for one night for a ski trip and this was the only property available for less then 150.00/nt that looked even half-way decent. After Check-in I realized that this was all needed. We reserved a Riverside Superior room for 123.00/nt, because it seemed like a little more space. The room was quite large at about 400 sqaure feet, and had a patio looking out at the river. The room wasnt luxurious by any stretch, but it was clean and came with most amenities a person would need, including a refridgerator. I would suggest getting this room because it was only about 7.00 to 10.00 more per night then the economey or standard rooms, and it looked considerably larger. The lodge came with a indoor heated pool, and enclosed outdoor jacuzzi. They were both decent, and we had the place to ourselves, so it was quite pleasant. Stowe Mountain is about 5 mins up the road and is a very easy drive. There are also several nice restaurants close by, and quite a few areas for ski rentals.", "title": "Not bad at all....", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "icem2829", "date": "February 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4457315}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best vacation ever p", "text": "All in all I highly recmd. this place based on the low rate, and the clean comfortable accomidations.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 11, 2006", "id": 4346801}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "We would not stay there again", "text": "My husband and I have been staying for a week or more", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MarkFPlantation", "date": "October 14, 2005", "id": 4022788}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Beware of cancellation policy", "text": "every summer at the Sun and Ski Motel in Stowe, Vermont for over ten years.

The bed was hard as a rock, dipping in the middle with flat pilliows. The wallpaper was peeling off in several places in the room. There was even a light plate missing from a receptable behind the bed. The night clerk was not willing to relocate us to a better room and was not very friendly at all. We booked this place due the nice website, but guess pictures do not show the complete package.
