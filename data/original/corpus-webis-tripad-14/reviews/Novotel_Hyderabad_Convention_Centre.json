The main restaurant offers a buffet style lunch and a la carte in the evening. The buffet has a range of foods from across the world - with everything looking and tasting freshly made. I chose to breakfast in my room rather than use the restaurant and the room service was prompt (20 minutes) and the food always hot and fresh. If you attending the conference centre or visiting business in the west/north-west of Hyderabad this is the perfect base. I didn't experience the attached night club but it certainly seems to be a 'hot spot' at the moment with several contacts mentioning it. The spa was also excellent - with the best deep tissue massage of my life.", "title": "cool", "user": "krsnaa", "date": "January 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 54737560}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Novotel hotel and the adjoining Convention Centre are probably one of the best in India.", "title": "Two Words...Bed Bugs", "user": "Trainhopper", "date": "January 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 54365861}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled on business", "text": "i sayed at the novotel hyderabad during the bulk pack conference on 8 april 2010. the hotel was very clan, had all state of art amenities and facilities. what impressed me most was the room service which was very prompt. the food quantity was also sufficient for 2-3 persons- though i was staying alone.", "title": "Very clean and luxurious hotel", "user": "mallikasingh", "date": "May 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 63472099}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled on business", "text": "i would take a line to convey my thanks to the gentleman who picked up my bag and carried it to the exhibition ground alongwith me. later i learnt he was the CEO of the hotel. he enquied if my stay was comfortable. i would like to say here that the stay was eextremely comfortable and satisfying. only probem is it is very far off from the city- the shopping area.", "title": "A business standard hotel", "user": "victory_lover", "date": "May 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 63428667}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled on business", "text": "the stewards in attendance during our meeting in granite II on 8th evening were extrememtly courteous and respopnsive. very much appreciated.", "title": "one of the best", "user": "travellocity", "date": "May 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 63220681}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "mallika", "title": "Good to try once!", "user": "chrmohan24", "date": "May 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 63110090}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Very disapointing according to ACCOR's standards", "text": "This is a true business standard hotel, i stayed here for my company's business meeting for 2 days.
