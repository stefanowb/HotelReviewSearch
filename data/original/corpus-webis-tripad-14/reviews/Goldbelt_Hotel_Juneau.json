Called the hotel a week in advance of cruise to confirm & explain about the extra night. When we checked in they had us in a rear of hotel view. Hotel was booked solid & they couldn't change us to water view. Very poor ventilation & no AC in room. They have a fan that we put in front of open window to get air flow. We had a 6 am flight & had arranged for a 3:45 am wake up call that they forgot about!!

The view (7th floor, water view) was fantastic! The room itself, however, was only mediocre for the price paid. The beds were noisy (sound of the springs in the mattress), but comfortable. The green industrial carpet could have used a fashion update. The bathroom was small, lacked an exhaust fan, and we could tell exactly when our neighbor turned on the tub or flushed the toilet. The soaps and other toiletries (Bath & Body Works) were a very nice touch. The wi-fi was nice, but one of the two desk outlets was non-functional and the other was being used to plug in the lamp, so to run my laptop I had to unplug the desk lamp. Ventilation was via a box-fan, which was silent at the low setting, but very noisy at medium and high speed.
