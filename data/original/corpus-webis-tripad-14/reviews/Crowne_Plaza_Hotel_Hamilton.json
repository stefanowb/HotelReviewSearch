Then all of a sudden a new charge came up claiming they found evidence we smoked in our room (yeah too bad we don't smoke at all) for 250.00 (this was after the complaint aginst her was filed) so I told her it was crap and I was again going over her head now all of a sudden oh it may have been the wrong room let me double check that was yesterday still no call back and almost a week later still no refund to our bank account!!

It was pricier than we normally pay for a tournament hotel, so I suppose I was expecting a bit more ... but it wasn't anything special. It is easy to find which is good and centrally located, which is also good ... the parking lot, however, takes quite the navigational skills to work! The beds were comfortable and the internet worked fine, and everything seemed clean. The housekeeping staff was pleasant and polite. There is no room service (except for a very expensive morning breakfast) so we had to run out at nice to find a pizza place close by and the elevators were painfully slow. However, check-in and out was smooth and pleasant. The bathrooms were tiny! Our biggest complaint though, and I would caution anyone else staying here - we had a room facing the main (King) street. It was so loud we could hear everything on the street at night. To make matters even worse, the curtains did not close so our room did not get dark at all - we got the lights and sounds from the street all night ... it did not make for a restful sleep even though the beds were comfortable.", "title": "All-in-all it was OK but don't get a room facing the street", "user": "clamc40", "date": "April 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 27725737}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009", "text": "After spending four days in Hamilton, we stayed overnight because of weather difficulties on our homebound flight and spending 7 hours on a plane that couldn't land.", "title": "Needs fine tuning (makes sure plumbing, tv, thermostat works) but will be a great hotel", "user": "TruroGal", "date": "February 21, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 24926887}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we arrived it was past 9 pm and we had to catch a flight the next morning, so it was a brief stay.
