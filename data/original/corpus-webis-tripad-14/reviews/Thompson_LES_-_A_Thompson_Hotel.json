They remained professional, cordial and helpful at ALL TIMES during the discussions that I had with various staff, in particular Sebastian at the front desk, with whom I spoke numerous times. In fact, they were helpful on premise, by email and by phone. They also tried to make sure we understood what the next steps were and made recommendations for follow-ups that were beyond normal service requirements. They never made us feel as though we were being unreasonable and apologised numerous times for any adjustments that needed to be made. In other hotels, I could imagine a somewhat less courteous approach would prevail.", "title": "Cool hotel, Hot location", "user": "ibuk01", "date": "January 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 150331499}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "In terms of the rooms, etc., they were reasonably sized and decorated for an upscale boutique hotel.

Its incredibly central and so much is walkable from here. i would 100% disagree with any review that says the hotel is noisey. I stayed on the 8th floor (apparently the bar/club is on the 7th) and i didnt hear anything for the entire time. Nor did i hear anything from the restaurant. The hotel never felt busy or crowded and was always spotlessly clean with very friendly staff. I asked for a late check out and it was obliged, we also arrived early and our room wasnt ready but another one was found straight away as we were keen to get in after a long flight.

It was absolutely perfect. There was a better room than the one I had booked so they offered me a great deal and I took it. It was a corner room, which had a breathtaking view of the city, a view of the pool and some privacy. I went in the pool the next day, which is just an amazing gem to have in the middle of NYC. The staff was so helpful and friendly, it was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. We hung out at the hotel until we went on a booze cruise out of the South Street Seaport, came back and wound down on the balcony as we looked at the night skyline. Bed was really comfy and the room was very well-kept. There's no place I'd rather have been with my friends to celebrate my 25th birthday. I'll be returning in a few weeks to stay for a night for a concert at Terminal 5 and I can't wait.
