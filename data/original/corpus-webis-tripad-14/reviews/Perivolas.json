Yes, the \"house\" was minimalist but a television would have been an intrusion. We found the staff absolutely delightful, always cheerful and nothing was too much trouble. We did have pool service - it was excellent. Our room was kept spotless and even the chair covers on the balcony were changed daily. We have stayed in some extremely posh luxury hotels around the world and if it's in-your-face-luxury you're looking for, then possibly Perivolas is not for you. However, it is a unique experience and certainly the only time we have stayed anywhere for one week but have felt like we've had a 2-week vacation.
