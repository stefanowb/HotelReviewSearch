The hotel is in a great location between Santa Eulalia and Es Canar - right on the sea front, great views and we preferred being away from the resorts. There are some lovely coastal walks from right outside the hotel, 10 min walk to Cala Pada beach where you can catch the boat to other parts of the island, and there are some reasonable bars and restaurants within a 15 min walk too. The rooms itself was ok, on the small/basic side but fine for us - the beds were comfy and the bathroom was good with shower over bath. I was particularly impressed with the maid service - there was a do not disturb sign and we were never disturbed when we put this on the door handle even when we stayed in the room til 1pm one day and our room was still serviced after we left. We were a little disappointed by the food served by the hotel - we'd booked room only so it wasn't too much of a problem for us but we had breakfast on one morning and dinner on two nights - very cheap but all the food was buffet style, edible but not of a particularly high standard. All in all, a good hotel in an excellent location and we would definitely stay again and recommend it to others.", "title": "Good hotel in fantastic location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JimBobGlossop", "date": "October 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143927717}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Just returned from a week in the sunshine at this great hotel. A group of 8 ladies looking for an easy going late summer break. We arrived in the evening, after dinner had finished but as the hotel knew that we would be arriving late they had left a cold buffet for us which was wonderful. The rooms are comfortable and clean and had everything that you might need, we had arranged to have upgraded rooms with fridges, hairdryers and views over the pool area to the sea. Our room unfortunately was at the back of the hotel, but on enquiring the next day this was changed without any fuss at all. The staff are all lovely, the houskeeping staff keep the hotel pristine, the reception staff and friendly and efficient, the animation team were terrific and kept us well entertained but were not at all pushy if you didn't want to take part in an activity. However happy memories of Zumba in the baby pool. laughing therapy and the themed flower power and white nights will stay with me for a very long time. The pool had a lifeguard every day and the pool and pool area were cleaned every morning and was as with the rest of the hotel pristine. There is a chldrens play area and indoor childrens club. The hotel has a nice bar area and plenty of public rooms to relax in, there is a small library of books that guests have left behind and there is also a table tennis room. The food at the hotel is served buffet syle and there was always a wide choice of hot and cold dishes, you would be very hard pressed not to find something yummy to eat. One of our party was gluten intolerant and the hotel provided gluten free bread for her and were able to give her info on any of the dishes when asked. Just outside the hotel were steps down to a small beach, although a 5 minute stroll away either way takes you to larger beaches, my favourite was Cala Pada, this is where you can get the ferry to Santa Eulalia and onto either Cala Llonga, a gorgeous beach and small seaside town, or onto Ibiza town, really easy and a great way to see the costline. In ibiza there is an Amneisa Club shop so you dont even have to go to the nightclub so get a little taste of the highlife!! The resort of Es Cana is about 1.5 miles away, an easy stroll and has bars and restaurants a plenty, bit too touristy and busy for me though. The Hippy Market, free to enter, is on every Wednesday is just before you get to Es Cana so easy to walk to. Its definitely worth visiting but it wasnt at all cheap, actually we saw some of the same things in shops for way less, they didn't like to barter either and definitely go early as it gets very busy with coach parties coming from all over the island. Very close to the hotel is a little Spa shop which had all the essentials and just behind Cala Pada is a slightly larger store with more choice for bits for sandwiches etc. There are a couple of nice restaurants within easy strolling distance and we had a lot of fun at Paco's bar on a couple of evenings. The end of season reggae night at Cesars beachfront bar was fun too. Beer and local wine are not too expensive but g &t's or vodka, although large measures were a bit steep in price. This is not a cheap island, but we had a wonderful time there, there weather was great, warm every day, although a little cloudy on a couple of the days, the hotel is a great place to chill out. It was my first time in Ibiza but it certainly won't be my last!!", "title": "A wonderful week", "user": "TravellingLight02", "date": "October 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 141867860}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "this was my third year at the club augusta,this time the first week, with a group of 8 ladies of a' certain age':-) second week with partners", "title": "another fabulous holiday !!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "benbobby", "date": "October 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141866928}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "both weeks were yet again, fantastic!
