The location of the hotel is ideal on the banks of the ness river with lovely views. Unfortunately the problems started when we went to check in at 4pm as advised on our arrival an hour earlier. When reception staff were presented with the pre paid hotel voucher it was noted that there was no record of our reservation.(The hotel booking was made through travel republic) We were asked to wait in bar area. Fortunately we were lucky to receive the last room in the hotel or not as the stay progressed (Room no 1). The room we were given was a standard room similar to what we had booked. It was extremely small,cluttered,dated and not in the best repair i.e broken tiles in the bathroom. Room security was poor with one flimsy lock insitu. I personally did not feel safe in the room. The room adjacent and upstairs was noisey when they flushed their toilet or turned their taps on a huge racket could be heard. As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary i had pre booked dinner in Abstract restaurant in the hotel.The menu choice was fair. The food quality was good, its presentation fair. We were given complementary food items in between courses. Between each course there was a considerable wait. Do not eat here unless you have lots of time on your hands and expect poor service. From starters to completion of desert took approx 2.5 hours. However when you ask for the bill and it doesn't arrive 30 minutes later and you haven't been asked if you drinks would like to replenished we left the restaurant. In the bar area we ordered post dinner drinks and for the restaurant bill. The bar staff alerted the manager on duty. We explained what had happened.Apologies were given and told that it would be followed up. Complemantry drinks were provided however still no restaurant bill appeared. We were asked by hotel manager to eat in other retaurant in the hotel the next evening where he would personally look after us. The next evening we decided to eat early 6pm booking. The service to begin with was satisfactory even though the restaurant was very quiet and their was only one waiting staff. Menu choice good. Food quality good. We had starters, main course and asked to see dessert menu. After 45 minutes we managed to get the attention of the only waiter and asked for the bill. which was incorrect as were charged for drinks ordered which never got to our table.Well where do i begin with breakfast the next morning. Terrible service for start to finish. Ordered the full cooked breakfast. Delicious. Continental buffet selection poor. No cold meats or cheese to choose from. Poor bread selection unless you ate sliced bread or croissants only. On our last morning breakfast experience didn't improve was told no brown bread available in the hotel as it didn't get delivered. There ars lots of small shops within hotel proximity where brown bread could be purchased. Upon check out lots of unhappy people checking out complaing about poor service and lack of staff in the hotel. We checked out of the hotal swiftly as possible not wanting to spent another moment there. Did get to see final sum for our restaurant bill from first night but no breakdown. Will definately not be returning or recommending to friends or family .will be advising against them staying here. In my opinion hotel does not deserve to keep its current star rating without lots of imput from management to improve this hotel overall.", "title": "Too Expensive for what it is....", "user": "stevemcl10", "date": "April 14, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 61288575}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed for the weekend, booked through laterooms at \u00a375/night, but was forced to pay the at upgrade of \u00a330 because the reserved room was really cramped.

Going to their Piano Bar we were pleasantly surprised and impressed with the decor and charming bar staff; along with their cocktail and whisky list - which were extensive. Their food (of which we had some starters) was mouthwatering and due to the late hour, quickly served. Alas that was the highlight of our stay; with the service letting it down greatly in terms of forgetting to book our taxi to the airport (even though we had requested it and seen the receptionist write it down) to the lack of knowledge of the local area (was misinformed of where one of my town appointments was) to the horrendous one hour wait for our lunch on the Sunday and we had to push to get it within that time frame!
