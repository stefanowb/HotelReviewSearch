First I'll say what I liked about the hotel. I liked that it was within walking distance to the airport to make our early morning flight. I also liked the pool, fitness center & the outdoor area for a relaxing sunbathing day before the long travel home. What I didn't like. The price of the hotel is very expensive so you would expect exceptional customer service. WRONG! It was by far the worst customer service I had during my 17 days of travel in Italy. The check-in wait was long & we were asked two separate times to switch lines because other more demanding platinum customers were in need of assitance. Talk about feeling SECOND CLASS! The staff in the fitness center were very rude to my husband when he attempted to wear flip-flops into the pool area a lady very meanly scolded him & demanded we wear hair nets. When inquiring about Wi-Fi we were told there would be a charge even though it was my understanding when booking the hotel that as a Gold member you could get a password for free internet. Then I waited in line in the lobby to see the concierge as sign instructed for a password to use the lobby computer for a considerable while, again having to waiting lines only to find out that even the hotel lobby computer was a pay per use computer. The restaurant was WAY over-priced as was the bar.

We were on our way out on a flight from Fiumicino (or so we thought). I chose this place because I had points and was able to book this room for very little money and because it was close to the airport. It fulfilled its closeness--it is right at the airport--we took the Leonardo Express train from Rome and just followed the signs from the train station to the hotel. It was about a 10 minute walk with many moving sidewalks to speed you along the way. Despite a long line at the reception desk, we were quickly checked in and were given a big room in one of the corridors radiating off the central core where the elevators were located. It was a king room and it was clean, had a comfortable bed, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, and very nice bath amenities. We quickly freshened up and headed downstairs for dinner. It was very busy in the restaurant and were told we would have a long wait so settled in at the very nice bar with a glass of wine and beer. After only about 10 minutes we were seated. Our server was prompt and professional. Since we were at the Hilton we decided to have our first burger of the entire trip (a little homesick I guess) and it was good. I also had the soup--can't remember if it was pasta fagioli or minestrone but that wasn't quite as good. The prices were fairly high but kind of to be expected since it is the only place around to eat (I guess you could go over the airport and eat if you want to). We had a great night's sleep and were able to print out our boarding passes at a computer set aside for this purpose. We ate breakfast at the hotel which was a buffet and was fine (if again pricey). Since we were flying to the U.S. our terminal at the airport was 5 and this is not near the hotel but they provide an excellent shuttle service which quickly got us to the terminal. This should have been the end of the story...but it wasn't. After sitting on the tarmac for about 2 hours US Airways cancelled our flight due to mechanical issues (no weather radar working) and wouldn't you know it--we were sent to the Hilton again! The fact that we had stayed there the night before caused some confusion--they had our information on file and this messed things up somewhat. However, even with all of the people from the flight waiting in line it only took about 10 minutes to check in. Again the room was comfortable although not quite as nice--a queen bed, smaller, not as nicely decorated. The Hilton had one other flight in the same predicament and they set up a buffet in one of the conference rooms for lunch, dinner, and breakfast--not up to the quality of the restaurant but not bad either and I'm pretty fussy. We weren't allowed to take the shuttle in the morning until a certain time so we walked over to terminal 2 or 3 and took a shuttle from there to terminal 5 and it was a good thing because there was some difficulty with printing out our boarding passes. So all in all, it is a bit expensive but clean, efficient, and convenient to the airport. We found a charge for the second night on our credit card when we got back home (due to the confusion of the previous night's stay I'm sure) but before my husband even had time to challenge it it had been removed.", "title": "Quiet room at the airport", "user": "VirginiaTraveler014", "date": "January 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148982634}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Just a long walk from the airport so very convenient if you are flying in or out of Rome.

At that time, the hotel was clean, convenient and offered a free shuttle bus to downtown Rome. Unfortunately, during my most recent stay, only two (2) out of three (3) of the previous advantages still existed. The hotel is convenient if you are flying in/out of Rome's Fiumicino, Leonardo da Vinci Airport. You can walk the approximate 10 minutes to the hotel via the enclosed walkways. At the end of the walkway before entering the hotel, definitely take the elevator to the ground level. It may be a bit of a wait for the elevator, but unless you want to be overwhelmed with the smell of urine, stay out of the stairwell leading to the ground level. There is no reason for anyone to use the elevator or stairwell unless they are going to the hotel as there is nothing else near the end of the walkway. Therefore, it is rather curious that the hotel does not clean the stairwell and at least try to eliminate or cover-up the retched urine odor in the stairwell. The second remaining positive for the hotel is the free shuttle bus back and forth to the city center. The bus runs every other hour in each direction. We used the bus to go to the city center for sightseeing and for evening transportation to have dinner in the city. The bus trip is approximately 40 minutes. Unfortunately, the quality of the hotel has definitely dropped off and it is questionable whether the convenient location and the free shuttle bus balance out a merely average hotel. The price per night is not inexpensive and careful consideration must be made before deciding on this hotel. Restaurant quality is average, but the prices for the meals are quite high.
