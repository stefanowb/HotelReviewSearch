We found the rooms to be spacious, professionally and comfortably appointed, tastefully decorated and cozy. The native hawaiian eucalyptus wood floors and moldings created a regal elegance. Our room overlooked the expansive front lawn full of cardinals and pretty little bright yellow birds. The highlight of our visit was the meals. Kenny and Kilohana created the most tasty breakfasts and dinners. Homemade breakfast sausage, homemade icecream... buckwheat pancakes, french press kona coffee, yum! They even graciously accommodated my gluten free needs. Complimentary wine and beer in the evenings topped off a wonderful stay.
