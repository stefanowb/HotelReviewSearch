The rooms are spacious and have clearly been recently modernised and come with sky tv which you can switch a large selection of the channels in to English. This was something we really appreciated as there is not a lot to do in Civitavecchia, particularly where the hotel is - in fact the area the hotel is in has very few redeeming features. The gentleman at reception (I think probably the owner) was very helpful and recommended as we had plenty of time to kill we should head into the promenade area near the port which has had a recent make over, as well as having several bars and restaurants. As we had arrived early in the day we took up his suggestion and took a taxi down there (be aware taxi\u2019s are very expensive - 15 euros for a 3km drive on the way down and 10 euros for the return). The area was pleasant for a couple of hours and we had excellent pizza in a restaurant recommended by the hotel for lunch.", "title": "Good Hotel for a Nights stay before a Cruise", "user": "jb812", "date": "August 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 137234246}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The best part about the hotel was its restaurant on an evening, if you choose to dine there you will be in for a treat with some excellent Italian cooking at a very reasonable price, we had a 4 course meal for 30 euros each and it was all of the highest quality, with excellent friendly service.

All at once a young lad rushed up saying he would help us with the tickets - tried to carry our luggage - help us onto the train etc. He was very persistant but we got rid of his unwanted attention by giving him a 2 Euro tip which was far less than he wanted and he complained bitterly to no avail!!

In fairness they do mention the small bed but I didn't notice it at the time of booking. Although the hotel looks as though it's near the sea in fact you can't walk down to the sea as it is a built up area. The hotel has a small restaurant where we ate as there was nowhere else to go in the area. The breakfast was also extremely poor. The hotel is listed as 4 star but our experience would give it 2 star maximum. The only positive point I would make is that they run a shuttle service in the mornings from the hotel directly to your cruise ship.

The rates are reasonable, and our ground floor room was quiet, relatively spacious and had a better than average bathroom for a three star hotel in Europe. Civitaveccia is a long way (a 50 minute drive) from the Rome airport (FCO), and the hotel's van price for transporting us at 110 Euros was actually below the rates quoted by other providers; expecially when one considers that we arrived at 10:00 P.M. and had to wait 45 minutes for our luggage. The van driver was still cheerful at that hour. Breakfast the next day was typical and pretty decent. We knew how to find our way to a shopping area about 20 minutes walk, so we could get Euros from an ATM and buy wine for on board at a local,and therefore reasonaly priced, grocery store. The van carried us and our luggage, along with that of two other cruise bound couples, to the ship without charge, and it is not a short distance. One would not use this hotel to see the (very limited) sights of Civitaveccia, but one does not go to that city for sightseeing, or or to sample fine Italian dining anyway.
