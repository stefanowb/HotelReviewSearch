Great location - only 1 block from convention center. Very nice Hampton - got upgraded to corner room. Large room w/refrigerator, coffee pot & microwave. Free happy hour (beer, wine and snacks). Typical Hampton free breakfast. Lots of restaurants within walking distance - PF Changs right across the street, Melting Pot around corner, Flemings steak house 1 block away). This hotel was not one of the \"official\" convention hotels - but was much closer to convention center than others. Paid $189/night (which isn't bad for a down town hotel). Hotel was full (due to convention and Hurricane evacuees from Houston) - but services still first rate.

Being familiar with Austin I wanted to be in the thick of the best nightlight and great restaurants and didn't want to have to drive. You can't beat this location at 2nd and San Jacinto, you are with 3 to 8 blocks of all of Austin's downtown nightlife and there is lots of it. As far as the hotel, the rooms are freshly and tastefully decorated with new beds and they are very comfortable with nice linens and plenty of comfy pillows. The bathroom could be a little bigger but it is no means small and the plumbing is all updated and in good working order and very clean, plenty of towels. We were on the 9th floor, and there was no noise either from the hallway (and we were close to the elevator) as well as from outside so the rooms must be well insulated. There is no Wi-Fi on the upper floors but there is FREE high-speed internet by an Ethernet cable right on the desk and plenty of plug ins for your computer and electronic equipment. Overall it's a 9+, the only upsetting thing was the vending machines. The soda/water vending machine on our floor didn't work the 2 days we were there even after a call to the front desk, the one on the 8th floor dispensed wrong items and this is frustrating when you want a diet Coke and get a Dr. Pepper. The hotel needs to jack-up their vending service provider. I did think that for a Hampton Inn the price of nearly $200 a night was a little steep, but considering the location and the nice amenities I wouldn't call it a great value but, competitive with other hotels in the area.", "title": "Location and comfort is top notch", "user": "RandT", "date": "September 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 20510397, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Free Hi Speed Wi-Fi, Great hot breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 The vending machines"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at The Hampton Inn for 1 night in September 2008.", "title": "Great location for downtown Austin!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Seamo", "date": "September 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 20340489, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good location so could walk everywhere", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled solo", "text": "The hotel was easy to find and drive too, being just off the interstate, and parking was easy too.

Great value . I am ususally traveling by myself, so the size of the room is no big deal. The Hampton in Austin has wired and wireless internet. I used the wired and the bandwidth was OK for streaming media, etc. I sleep in a waterbed at home and the beds at Hampton are the first \"normal\" hotel beds I have found that I can sleep on without waking up every 15 minutes. I also have a pillow fetish and they give you so many I have never had to call down for more..I stayed here for a convention and if you cut through an alley you can be at the convention center in less than 5 minutes. The free breakfast bar has everything from \"healthy choices\" to artery clogging ham and eggs. Managers \"happy hour\" features a local Bock beer as well as Bud Lite and several wines. Walked home about 10 blocks from an entertainment venue on Sixth Street without any concern for crime, and my radar is always up. Just a great place to stay if you don't need all the expense associated with a \"full service\" hotel. I also screwed up my reservation and made my checkout day one day early, and the front desk just extended my stay without any BS at the same discounted rate.
