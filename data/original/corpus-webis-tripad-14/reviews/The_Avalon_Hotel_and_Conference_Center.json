They've kept up the lobby and ballroom/conference facilities which seem to be their main business. If you only came to an event here, you'd think the rest of the hotel was probably pretty nice. Unfortunately as soon as you get in the elevator you realize they've let the place get run down. Upstairs hallways are missing baseboards. Stains on carpet cannot be ignored. Same thing in the rooms. The bathrooms really need to be updated. The sheets are dingy and stained. Not that it was dirty, it just felt that way. It was NOT a relaxing place to stay. Seems to cater to guests who are in town for party scene and can get a little loud at night. Bottom line is that there are several places in Erie that are much nicer for the same price.

The sheets, towels, floor and bathroom were clean. There were no roaches or other insects running around. The only bad thing...our room was super hot. We set it to 40 degrees, left and went to a wedding, and when we came back it still felt like the devil was chilling in our room. But since it was a cool night, my boyfriend was able to open the window and life was good. It was also convenient since the event was in the Presque Isle ballroom (which is beautiful!). We were able to walk to all the bars on State Street with ease. Sure this place is no 4 star hotel, but it is not THAT bad. I think with some updates, this hotel will be worth its daily price.

Our room was very clean, as was our bedding, towels, etc. The bed was comfortable, and the only reason sleeping was somewhat uncomfortable was because the room was a little warm.
