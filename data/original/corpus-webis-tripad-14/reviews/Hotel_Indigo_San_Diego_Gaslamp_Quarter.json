The shower has one of those wand-type arrangements which jumped out of my hand, turning my morning shower into a Kramer-like adventure. Room has coffee maker, safe and iron, but no refrigerator. Short walk to many bars and restaurants. Valet parking (your only hotel option) is steep at $38. Nice pillows and a shade that makes the room dark made for excellent sleeping.

The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to PETCO park and 5th Ave in the Gaslamp Qtr (where most of the restaurants, gastro pubs, bars and clubs are located). The rooms are modern, clean and the beds were very comfortable. Reception was professional and efficient checking and out. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay at a reasonable price. The only drawback is the price for parking ($37 a night) which I found steep. I did not ask if there was a discount for multiple night stay as we luckily found a parking spot on the street around the corner from the hotel and did not have to pay.
