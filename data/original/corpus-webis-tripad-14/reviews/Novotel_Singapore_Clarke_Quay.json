Our room there was fantastic and well decorated with a bathroom with a seperate shower as well as a shower over the bath. Service was efficient whenever we requested anything and as for the premier lounge staff nothing was too much trouble for them. The lounge was a great place to relax after a hot day out with a varied range of food and complimentary alcohol between 6 - 8pm with soft drink and coffee available during lounge opening hours. Breakfast was relaxing in the lounge but if you wanted a wider variety we could eat at the restaraunt downstairs which was also very good.

The hotel was next to the river so it was ideal for going out on the riverside, although we found it very expensive to eat and drink. The pool was nice although we went down twice and found we couldnt get a bed so had to use a chair which isnt ideal when you want to have a sleep or sunbathe. Singapore MRT is cheap and ideal as the station is only five mins away and Taxis are cheap but for eating out and drinking it is expensive I would say more expensive than London. There is a supermarket next to the hotel where you may want to buy cold cans to put in the mini bar as drinks in the mini bar are over \u00a32.00 for a can of 7UP.

Due to a late flight our arrival was several hours later than expected at 3am. So all we wanted to do was get to our room and sleep ! The staff member and porter on duty were very friendly and we were checked in very quickly. We had an accor card so had been granted an upgrade to the Club rooms at the hotels discretion. We get up to our room and were not amused to find two single beds despite requesting a King (and the fact that the girl on reception could see that my wife and I were a couple). So I told the porter to turn around and back down to reception we went. She was very apologetic and quickly arranged us a king room (one floor higher on about the 24th Floor I think). Despite being tired we were very impressed with this room and the view in particular. The lighting controls were especially good with a comprehensive control panel including night lights many different lighting combinations that you don't usually get. I left the room at about 9am to check Club lounge and find out what time breakfast was until. We had stayed on club floors before and you normally get access to this lounge and breakfast etc. However upon entering and giving my room number the pleasant (but very officious) staff member told me that as I had been given a complimentary upgrade I was not entitled to have breakfast in the cluib lounge or to use the facilities even though I was staying on the club floor. Given there was no one else there I found this a little odd and whilst fair enough you would think that a hotel of this calibre would show a little discretion. That aside, we loved the room and the hotel allowed us a late check-out until 2pm so we could sleep in. The bathroom was opulent and huge and the bath was also large. Only real negative about the room was the fact that you couldn't get onto the small balcony. Beds were also very comfortable. The hotel is very close to Clark quay and the associated nightlife and even on the 24th floor we could hear the music when we arrived. We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel despite the minor glitches and loved the restaurants and bars across the road. The hotel is not too far from the subway for travel to the airport (about 5 minutes walk). Didn't try the bar or restaurants but they looked expensive compared to the range of venues at clark quay.
