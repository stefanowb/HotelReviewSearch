The Galeria Plaza proved to be a fantastic choice. The people who work there where all very friendly and catered to our needs. The rooms were nicely appointed and very comfortable. The pool and gym facilities located on the top level were not espectacular but adequate and provided a place to relax and catch some rays. The hotel is within walking distance to many shops, restaurants and night clubs and to all forms of public transportation which will take you just about anywhere you want to go within the city.

There are police everywhere and the hotel staff looked out for our safety as well. We got a great bargain on the room and loved the location.

The Galeria Plaza is an outstanding hotel in every way. My partner and I stayed there for four nights, and we couldn't have been more pleased. The best quality of this hotel was the service. All of the staff were extremely helpful and eager to please. In particular, I can't say enough about the maid service. Everyday our room was cleaned to the tee; we even got cookies one day! Our room was delightful. Though our view of Mexico City wasn't stellar, it did not matter because we thoroughly enjoyed our room amenities (what a comfy bed!) and slick modern dark wood decor. The rooftop pool looked great but it was too cool outside to go swimming (Keep in mind that Mexico City is in the mountains.) The rooftop gym was quite adequate and had a beautiful view of the city. The hotel is in a great location - The Zona Rosa. This area has many great shops and restaurants, and the Metro is just a few blocks away. Lastly, the price is right. Check around on the internet. We stay for about $100 US dollars a night - quite reasonable for the outstanding quality of this hotel.
