From the outside I had never quite fancied it as it reminds me somewhat of an army barracks but upon my most recent stay I have to say the standards are quite high. Very good rooms with nice big comfy bed with too many pillows and cushions to count. All the usual features within the hotel, nice bar and restaurant, breakfast was ok although I had to wait until i'd finished my breakfast before they remembered my pot of tea, not a major issue in a busy breakfast room. Very handy for city centre and the exhibition centre close by so all in all a decent option for a city centre hotel.", "title": "Very decent option for a glasgow stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "GrahameHportsmouth", "date": "June 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164294249}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Lovely room,very clean,lovely woman at breakfast to show us our table!( she was excellent with her personality!
