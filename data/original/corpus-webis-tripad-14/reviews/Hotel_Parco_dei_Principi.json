This Hotel was designed by Gio Ponti and is a beautiful example of mid century modern elegance. Our room was on the fourth floor overlooking the Bay of Naples with Mt. Vesuvius in the distance. Simply breathtaking! The weather was beautiful and still warm. Bring washcloths, as two of the three hotels in which we stayed on our tour didn't supply them. Wifi is good in lobby as with most hotels. Bring conditioner for your hair if you need to or you can buy it there. You will also need one or two of those two prong converters for charging up your iPad to Face Time with family back home. Have a bottle of Dramamine if you get motion sickness.

Our wedding party was dotted across Sorrento and I can honestly say we could not have chosen a more perfect hotel for our stay in the Parco Dei Principi. We were naturally nervous about travelling with a 6 month old baby but the staff could not have been more courteous and helpful and made a fuss over our little girl,they provided a cot for her made up daily with beautiful linens. Our room had a balcony etched into the rock, from which we were able to enjoy stunning views of Naples. We were sent up a complementary fruit platter on our first night, a lovely touch. It is clear to see why this is a 5* hotel, from the idyllic swimming pool setting, unsurpassed in my many many trips for its tranquility and beauty, to the private beach which truly has the wow factor onto the harmonious and cohesive public areas where you would always be made to feel welcome and attended to, should you so require. Having visited other regions of Italy and Sardinia through a spectrum of hotels and experiences, this hotel stands out as a sanctuary of beauty, quite a rose amongst the noisy, dusty bustle of Sorrento town. Although I woul dnot visit Sorrento again as it is personally not to my taste, I would use the hotel group again without hesitation and would highly recommend the hotel to those who wish to visit Sorrento.

The positives of this hotel is it has large bedrooms and although the decor wasnt to my personal tatse it had everything you needed and a large balcony. The staff were very pleasant to us although at breakfast it could sometimes be a bit disorganised although this was never really a big issue and did not impact our stay. The views from this hotel are amazing and the beach area is a real plus with plenty of sun beds, i wasnt too keen on the pool area as it was a bit run down and i think it could do with a refurb. The food and drinks were expensive as are most hotels however there was plenty of choice at breakfast (maily continental) and i did enjoy it. This hotel is ideally located for the restaurants in Saint Agnello which are very close, reasonably priced, cheaper than sorrento and full of italians so you know they are good! It is about a 20 minute walk into Sorrento, there is a shuttle bus from the hotel but this needs to be booked in advance and doesnt run after 7pm.

The Hotel Parco dei Principi, was designed and built by the architect Gio Ponti and it is a masterpiece of contemporary art. Using exclusive lines, perfect plays of colours and meticulous attention to furnishings, Gio Ponti created the first \"design hotel\" of the Sixties. Each part of the property has been kept exactly as it was: all the interiors are original including the majolica tiles, the ceramics and the floors while outside the 27 hectares of historical gardens and the spectacular terrace allow to be closed to nature and sea. Created as a place of harmony, pleasure and relaxation, the hotel offers guests comforts which have been studied down to the smallest detail and is the essence of exquisite hospitality, well-being and relax. The private beach, the charming sea-water swimming pool set in the prestigious and elegant gardens, the Wellness Centre and the Fitness Centre provide guests with fascinating emotions and sensations."}
