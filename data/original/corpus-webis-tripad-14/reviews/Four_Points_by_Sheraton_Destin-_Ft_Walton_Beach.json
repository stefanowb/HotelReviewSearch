The location is great (right on the beach) and price is good. I'm interested to see the updates taking place, as the age of the hotel rooms was one of the minor negatives. The breakfast buffet is average and not worth the price if you don't have it included in the cost of the room already. The hotel is very kid friendly as well and has activities for the children planned the entire week.
