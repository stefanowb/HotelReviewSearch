I lived at Woodview (since it is also a rental facility) from July 2000 - Feb 2001. The facilities are beautiful. The pool is crystal clean and the jacuzzi and fitness center are also well kept. The staff caters to your every need and the continental breakfast on weekdays was so nice. If my experience is anything like staying here for a few nights I would highly recommend it. Thanks Korman for a wonderful place to live during my time in Malvern!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "BornToTravel", "date": "January 11, 2005", "id": 3001638}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Malvern"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
