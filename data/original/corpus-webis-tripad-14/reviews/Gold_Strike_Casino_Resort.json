The casino is located right next to 2 other ones so if you want to try another casino you can walk and not have to drive. Plenty of slots and table games.

Sunday buffet was brunch with champane and all the rest. We have stayed at the best including Belagio and the casino was great and in keeping with the size of the hotel. For those who want less noise and less smokers try the 2nd floor slots and poker tournament. The room was spacious and comfortable with large flat screen tv and very quiet. The pool was small, but when comparing with three other casinos was par and had 2 hot tubs. We visited Roadhouse, Bally's and Fitz did not have any desire to go to gamble.

It was clean, of standard size; and had a coffee pot in the room which is not the norm when you stay most casino hotels. Although there were no towels when I arrived in the room, housekeeping was on the floor prepping other rooms and gave me an armful with a smile.
