We were fortunate enough to be booked in one of the Executive Suites. The suite itself was amazing with a large outdoor deck and massive dining room area. However, at night, the room became quite warm and almost uncomfortable. Also, the electricity is shut off for a few hours overnight. The rooms have lanterns and flashlights so it was hardly an inconvenience. Most alcoholic beverages were included (with the suite booking) which was an added benefit. The property is absolutely gorgeous and the view of the sunrise from our deck was breathtaking. The food, although plentiful, was not the greatest. Meals were served buffet style which is something that I don't particularly care for. The staff at the property was cordial and accommodating but for the most part, they did not go out of their way like the staff from the other lodges we visited.

This was also where I felt the Mbalageti staff really stepped up to the plate. We were driven away from the main property to an open area that was beautifully decorated with lanterns. There was a dining table set up right out in the open and a chef and servers were preparing a feast for us. It was an exciting and frightening experience at the same time because there was always the chance that an animal could come by to visit and we heard sounds in the distance.
