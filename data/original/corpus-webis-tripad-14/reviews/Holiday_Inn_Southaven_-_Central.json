First off....the location away from the interstate and main roads is nice but they fail to tell you that you are right in line with Memphis International so the Fed Ex planes are coming in one after the other late at night which makes sleep difficult. Secondly..each time I've stayed I had to call down for a blanket,alarm clock,etc...each time was in the evening and it took a good while to get these items. The last time I had to go down to the desk after a period of long waiting for a blanket fo find what looked like to be a manager texting on her phone and said \"oh sorry I was about to bring your blanket\". I'm a platinum member and asked for an upgrade this last time and the female desk clerk said there are none available at this time but yet the parking lot was empty. Come to think of it the parking lot has been empty each time I've stayed. Guess that should have told me. Overal it's a nice hotel as far as the layout and design but between the planes all night long and the general careless attitude of the front desk I will not go back and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "title": "not so great of a hotel", "user": "travelinman2001", "date": "March 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 25528237}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Don't count on sleeping during the week as a steady stream of Fed Ex jets land constantly from 10-12 pm and begin taking off in equal numbers at 4 am.
