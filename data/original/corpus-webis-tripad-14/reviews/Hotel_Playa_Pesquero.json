It is a big complex so if you are far away from everywhere like my friend was just ask for another room & they should move you blocks! There is 2 restaurant buffets we found the white one to be better! Thats the 2nd 1 from reception. The pools are lovely, the beach is a short walk & very nice, free water sports for everyone at the sea. We had a couple of problems, 1, we had a kingsize bed & we had our 2 yr old with us & they gave us a cot which wasn't appropriate so we had our daughter with us for 2 weeks, but ask about all this at time of booking as an infant over there is age 3 & below even tho ya pay a child price! We didn't get a towel for her a place in the a la carte restaurant & no bed! The other thing was the a la carte restaurant on the beach, the seafood restaurant.... They were very busy & never had enough tables for us even though we had pre booked 3 days before, & they had a wedding on the beach to serve as well as the restaurant so we waited a very long time for a drink, & for our food, & when the food came it was presented very nice, we had lobster... but it was Well overcooked! It was a disappointment, very rubbery! We never went there again, it might av been cos they were too busy with the wedding party & the restaurant suffered! But the other a la carte's were very good!! And you get 4 a la carte's a week free!!! I Would advise to go to Le Bistro which is the one you pay for it was 15 cuban peso's about \u00a310, but that was the best gorgeous meal we had outta the 2 weeks!!

The food, to us, compared to the finest we'd eaten in such cities as Vancouver or Toronto. The clientele, unfortunately, often compared to your local Dairy Queen and while that's not bad in itself it really disrespects the people and the whole idea of the restaurant. Despite people being told to dress up (as if they were 4th graders), often some would come with t-shirts and jeans and talk across tables and even feed stray cats their leftover food in full view of the kitchen and waiting staff who prepared it and brought it to them.

This is a great hotel with tons of facilities to keep you amused, who cares if it's in the middle of nowhere (which technically it isn't by the way!). The hotel is massive, set in huge grounds which makes it feel like you're in a lillte resort so there's no need to venture out if you dont want to . We hired a car for 3 days and had a drive into the country, the scenery is beautiful. Other than the scenery though there's not much else to go and see, we didn't really need the car for the full 3 days. We drove into Holguin one day, expecting a tourist area with shops etc. There wasn't, believe me. Unless we went to the wrong place (Central Park) of course. We kind of just got stared at, we didn't feel unsafe at all, just out of place. Anyway, we'll put that one down to experience! One day we hired bikes from the hotel (no charge - bargain!) and had a ride down the road from the hotel. It was nice to meet some of the locals. If you get a chance to, nip in to the farm on the right hand side (as you come away from the hotel). There is a lovely couple who live there, very hospitable and they have lots of animals etc., great fun. Back to the hotel. If you can make your reservations for the a'la carte restaurants as soon as you arrive as they can get booked up quickly. Having said that, we had no problems whatsoever, even for the Romantico (which is great - very posh!). The rooms are excellent, very clean etc. We had no problems with the water, no problems with getting clean towels and no problems with the staff. They are extremely friendly and polite, the Cubans are great people! The pool is fantastic, the best we've ever experienced. It's huge so it never feels crowded. And yes it is cold, but not freezing as some have said. You're in a hot country, get over it! The beach is beautiful, lovely white sand and turquoise sea. You have to go on a catamaran, it's great fun! My husbands favourite thing was the beer garden (surprise surprise!). They serve icy beer in chilled glasses and chunky burgers to make your eyes water, not to mention the misty chicken! The only negatives really I would say are the toilets (can get a little smelly at times) and the wait at the lobby bar in the evenings. But hey, you're on holiday, who's in a rush? All in all this was a great holiday and we have no complaints. We would recommend this hotel to anyone. We have also been to a five star hotel in Mexico as some other users have mentioned and to be honest we think that this hotel is up there with the best of them.
