The staff is excellent, amenities cannot be beat, and the location is great if you want to do any shopping at all (and I do often!). Unlike many hotels it is easy to get to from all directions and plenty of self parking (good if you're driving around town.) Best of all, the beds have great pillows on them. Only drawbacks are: you pay for wifi, the swans look a little cramped in their fountain, and the pool is a skinny box that is heavily chlorinated. Overall, my favorite place to stay in Austin.", "title": "You'll enjoy it more than the swans do...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jayci", "date": "August 15, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3767314}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved the Embassy", "text": "Great Stay, couldn't ask for much more from an Embassy Suites.

This property offers all the usual Embassy Suites amenities (free made-to-order breakfast, free happy hour, etc.) and in addition the lobby area (complete with swans and reflecting pools!) is beautiful. A very relaxing stay and our room location (a suite) was perfect (very quiet). Would highly recommend the suites .... extra large room with a wet bar and living area included and the price was very affordable. Can book reservations on the internet and save even more $$$ too. I plan to stay here on any future trips to Austin .... most excellent!!!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 28, 2004", "id": 1845190}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Gorgeous Hotel!", "text": "I have stayed in this hotel many times and I am never disappointed! The staff is friendly and professional, the swans are gorgeous. The food and happy hour are fantastic!! I recently treated my parents to a weekend at this hotel. The staff was super nice and treated them like VIPs! This hotel is one of the best values for the money. I fully recommend that if you stay in Austin, you should not want to stay anyplace else!! The staff always seems to know the right place to suggest for dinner. Also, kudos to the evening front desk manager (Josh H.) for being so super nice!!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 9, 2003", "id": 1511057}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Austin"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 20, "very good": 69, "terrible": 10, "excellent": 177}, "aka": "Embassy Suites Hotel Austin", "slim_ranking": 0.0828729281768, "description": "Embassy Suites Austin \u2013 Arboretum, is only minutes away from downtown Austin and within walking distance of the Austin Arboretum\u2019s shops and restaurants.
