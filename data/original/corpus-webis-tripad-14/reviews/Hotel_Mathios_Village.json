Originally we booked this trip in May 2005, but had to cancel due to illness. Mathios villas did not charge me anything for this inconvience. As a matter of fact when I rebooked it was at at different season and rates were slightly higher, but by only a few dollars. The booking agency actually charged me more at first, but corrected their mistake which I would have never know about had they not told me(thank you for your honesty). As I have read some of the other reviews, I see some very unhappy customers. Why they are unhappy, I don't know. I would like to address some of their issues. The reason you cannot take your own beverages to the pool bar area and you have to buy them from the pool bar is not because Kostas is greedy, as some have stated, it is because of the tax laws. Drinks are taxed diffently at pool bars, than inside of resturants. If the tax auditor comes, and they can come at anytime, and ask for receipts of everyone drinking by the pool and this shows that some have brought outside drinks, then Kostas would be fined heavily. Addressing the issue of renting towels: We in America are very wasteful. Santorini has a water problem (there is not enough of it) Therefore renting a towel for a couple of dollars helps keep from wasting water on unneeded washing. As far as cleanliness, I have stayed in 5 star hotels that were not this clean. Everything was spotless and we stayed in a standard room that overlooked the caldera. My wife and I stayed at Villas Mathios for 5 days and enjoyed every minute of it. Not once did I see Kostas act mean as some have stated. The prices were more than reasonable and my wife and I intend to go back in a couple of years and stay at Mathios Villas again. The town of Akrotiri that it is located in is quite and near the Red Beach and the Light House which had wonderful sunsets. I would like to thank Kostas personally for hosting us, and the kindness that he showed us (he even does some greek dancing by the pool). If you are going to Santorini my wife and I highly recommend staying here. The food, atmosphere, kindness, everything was beyond our expectations.

It seems that Costa's game is baiting you with the low room rate, then renting you a car, selling you overpriced drinks and snacks by the pool, forcing you to rent towels, etc. First, THE BUSES ARE FINE! He'll try to tell you they're always late, overcrowded, etc. The bus between Thira and Ia was crowded, but the others were not, and all were on time. Second, if you're going for a romantic getaway, get a room in Ia or Thira, because the rest of the island is a bit barren and depressing. The hotels in the towns are pricey because they offer breathtaking views - in my opinion, it's worth it. That said, Mathios Village does have a nice pool. Our room was clean, and the bathroom was big (although the glassed-in shower was the smallest of our budget-minded trip). That's it for the compliments. If you want a double bed, ASK FOR ONE. We assumed a \"special double\" room had a double bed - it had 3 twins. The sheets were thin and worn, and the towels were remarkably stiff and tattered (mind you, we're not 5 star travelers).", "title": "the best there is", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "renee11", "date": "October 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5922906, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 everthing!!", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We where in the wonderfull hotel of Villa Mathios, and had a perfect stay.
