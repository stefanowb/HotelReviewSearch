We are located 800 meters North East to downtown Vineyard haven in a quiet residential neighborhood. We have a variety of economic choices, as our family run business strives to provide a comfortable stay with a resonable price. Because we try to keep the prices down for guests, we offer a simple continental breakfast. At least two of our rooms have shared baths, so make sure you check the room details thoroughly when booking. During the warmer weather, enjoy our outdoor pool. For rainy days, all rooms now have flat screen LCD TVs and cable."}
