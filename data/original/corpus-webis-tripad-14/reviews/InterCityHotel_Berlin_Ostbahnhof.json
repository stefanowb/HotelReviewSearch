Really clean and modern, very comfortable. The best thing was the free travel card, no messing about with ticket machines, just jump on the train and if you change your mind or get lost just jump off and go somewhere else! It was valid all the way out to Oranienburg for the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, about an hour away. Could only hear the station announcements if the window was open, we were on the station side too. Great location for getting around Berlin. East side gallery opposite hotel. For breakfast we just used the food hall at the station, really good value.
