The staff on reception were exceptional, very helpful with restaurants, taxi, local pubs etc. Nothing was too much trouble. Very happy with room, very clean, the size was ok , I wasn't having a weeks holiday so ample for our needs. The bathroom was very good large shower and powerful. We loved the plasma screen on the wall, it was a very clear picture and worked perfectly. Plenty of coffee tea etc. Had a breakfast following morning, which was ample and pretty good. Had no problems walking across to the Leisure Centre for breakfast, always like a walk on a morning so the short distance was no problem. Ample car parking. Probably only down side is the close proximity to a very busy road. We got a room next to it but unbelievably never bothered me one minute during the night and believe me I had visions of being awake. Would probably ask for a room away from the road if I was to go again just in case.", "title": "No complaints with this hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sue1958", "date": "October 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 21310665, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Helpful staff, great tv, clean room", "disliked": "\u2014 Close proximity to main road"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "great clean rooms, with very nice showers, just the walk for breakfast in the morning was awful, not a far trek at all, but i dont want to get up in the morning and step out side to raind and wind to go and get a bite to eat, and even when we got to the leisure club where breakfast is held, not one seat available and the cue at the bar was literally still for what seemed like half an hour, so we checked out hopped into a taxi and had breakfast in this amazing cafe just over the bridge and up some stairs in york, wish i remembered the name of it!! still a very good hotel, with great priced rooms and good facility inside the room,", "title": "the breakfast trek!", "user": "andyaries", "date": "September 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19980714, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the comfortable bed and furniture, and the brill poewr shower", "disliked": "\u2014 walking to another building in the blistering cold to get brekkie"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "best for youngsters like myself id say", "title": "Very disappointing - Disabled beware!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "GrannyOrbie", "date": "August 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 18597032, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Actually the Receptionist on the Saturday night and Sunday morning - tried to help and was obviously embarrassed.

The carpet had not been vacuumed and wasn't the second day either - bed very shoddily made and my daughter's sofa/bed wasn't touched, neither were the tumblers changed.

We were pleased with almost everything except for the room servicing - something was missing each day. Toilet roll the 1st day, shampoo the 2nd & towels the 3rd. Our room was at the end of the hall so the maid was probably skimping by the time she got to our room. Overall though the hotel is clean & the staff friendly. The bar/restaurant is in a seperate building at the Leisure centre & food is ok. The room was only \u00a350 per night which didn't break the bank & we slept well even though you could hear the A1 motorway even with the windows closed. The Ramside up the road was totally over priced at special offer for the wedding party of \u00a362.50 p.p.s B&B. Most of the other guests were only staying for the one night there so it was ok. We were over from Ireland and due to flight restrictions had to stay the 3 nights. So I was glad I shopped around. I'd reccommend this hotel to anyone as it had all the amenities you could ask for and was comfortable and well priced for what you get. Only a 10min walk to the local pubs and Durham City is easy to get around & the shopping area is great with parking on the way into the city. We visited the Angel of the North while there & it's really impressive aswell as being a quiet beautiful sculpture. Well worth checking out, parking available just off the motorway. Only downfall was the torrental Rain - man we thought it rains here in Ireland but not a patch on the rain that fell there most of the wknd. Bring your rain gear!! Doubt we'll be returning to Durham for a long time but would stay again here if we did.
