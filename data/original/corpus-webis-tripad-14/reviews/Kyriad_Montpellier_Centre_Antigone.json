The hotel is located a couple of minutes from the Leon Blum tramway stop. It is within walking distance to Antigone, Galeries Lafayette and the old city. It is also near the river pathways for a nice walk. Restaurants are also quite nearby. The hotel staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and easy. Our room, though small, was of average size for a room in France. It was well appointed with a comfortable bed. The pillows though were too firm for us. The bathroom was large enough with an excellent shower. The room was very clean and in good order. The hotel offers free WiFi in the rooms. We decided the breakfast was too expensive - \u20ac20 for the two of us.
