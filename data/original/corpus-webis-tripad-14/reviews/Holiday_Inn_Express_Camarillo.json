We had 4 rooms for all three nights. Hotel staff was extremely accommdating and courteous throughout the entire stay. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. They all had microwaves and small refrigerators which were convenient for our group. The free contiental breakfast was better than we expected. There were plenty of items to choose from and they were fresh and good. Overall, this stay was a complete success and we will definately use this hotel when we return next year for competition.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 1, 2005", "id": 3624462}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2004", "text": "The staff keep this Holiday Inn clean. The rooms smelled and looked clean. The attendants kept the standard Holiday Inn Express quick start breakfast buffet well supplied with fresh food--no sunlamp sunburned cinnamon rolls or dried up hardboiled eggs at this one. Our king room included a mini kitchen with microwave, sink, refrigerator, dishes, cutlery which came in handy traveling with a baby. Everything in the mini kitchen was absolutely spotless! The bathroom was very light--not dingy like so many other hotel bathrooms and large enough to allow you to dress comfortably without banging elbows. The room was very large for a HI Express--more than enough room to keep the baby's stroller unfolded, leave suitcases out, and still have lots of room.", "title": "Nice, but lots of late night loiterers", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Azilla", "date": "February 24, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3226941}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Camarillo"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 18, "very good": 27, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 22}, "aka": "Holiday Inn Express Camarillo Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.6, "description": "Welcome to the Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Camarillo in the heart of the Ventura County.Conveniently located off Hwy 101 halfway between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara.
