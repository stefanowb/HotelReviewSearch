The reception was welcoming and went ahead smoothly. The room was spotless, modern and very well equipped. It even had an ice bucket and corkscrew! We had a meal in the restaurant and it was fairly pricey but delicious and very well presented. There are a few different areas to eat/drink in depending on what you want eg light snacks to full meal. There is a pool there and the children were looking forward to using it, but unfortunately, it's only open for children at certain times, it's as well to be aware of this.The location cannot be better if you're going to see a rugby match there! We had breakfast which was mainly buffet and there was an excellent selection of food to please everyone. One of the waiters suggested pancakes for the children and this was a big hit with them. Naturally, on a match day the hotel get's very busy and we were given a pass to get back into the hotel as there can be a queue to use the bar. We were able to leave our luggage at the reception while we watched the match.
