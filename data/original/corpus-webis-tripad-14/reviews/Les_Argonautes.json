SO CLOSE to everything you need in Paris, on a pedestrian street right by the Seine. Yes, the plate smashing at the neighboring Greek restaurants is annoying, but wear earplugs and it won't bother you. The hotel owner was totally nice and friendly, and the room was totally adequate for our needs.

Very much like other reviews said. The hotel is located in a great location--basically the center of Latin Quarter. Can walk to cafes, restaurants, shops, Metro stops, RER stops, and major attraction. Rooms are about the same size as other hotels in Paris. Price is very cheap considering the location. Room is fairly clean so is the shared toilet. It's a great budget hotel for students or travellers who don't stay in Paris for too long or hope for a romantic hotel.", "user": "Cacheandcow", "date": "October 17, 2006", "id": 5966486}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "great", "text": "The staff are not helpful but friednly. You can tell they try their best to provide services. There is no dial-tone telephone or internet connection. It is not quiet at night even tho I stayed in the back of the hotel. Breakfast is a little overpriced for 5 euro. It is a one-star hotel or Inn the most so do not expect too much for the room. Their rooms with toilet were all booked when I was there. And the lady almost couldn't find my reservation even tho I had emails from them and called to confirm days b4 my arrival.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 2, 2006", "id": 4408806}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Paris"}, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 19, "very good": 27, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 11}, "aka": "Les Argonautes Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.74456218628}
