We stayed 3 nights and had a room on the top floor, in the corner. We didnt hear any traffic noise and slept well in the huge bed. The only TV we could understand was CNN and we were able to follow the terrible events happening in New Orleans with the hurricane. The staff were very helpful however their English was limited, as was our Japanese. Breakfast was included in the tarrif, and was ok. The location is good, and i felt quite safe walking around the area on my own.

The only real difference between the rooms in both hotels in my opinion was the view (which is magnificent in the Park Hotel), the heated toilet seat and the lack of an in-room safe.
