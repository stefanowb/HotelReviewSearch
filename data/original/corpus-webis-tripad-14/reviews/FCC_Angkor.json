We booked a suite as we wanted more space for our son, and I was happy to find that the suite had a spacious living room area as well as a very spacious bathroom, consisting of a bathtub, rain shower area and toilet area. We had requested for a baby cot in our booking and while it was not in our room when we checked in, we asked for it again and it was brought in promptly. There was no extra charge for the cot, but it may not be suitable for toddlers or babies who can already flip on their own or crawl, as the mattress is rather high and the railings short - my son could easily hop over the railings to get onto the bed, as we had placed it right at the edge of our bed. It is a wooden cot, but not the sturdiest as there are a lot of screws sticking out and there is a gap from which he could slide out on one end. However, having said that, our son used it without incident and only under constant supervision and with us padding the area around the cot with cushions so that he would not be badly injured even if he were to fall out. The room was spacious enough such that we could still walk around the cot after placing it at the edge of the bed. We found the room and bathroom area to be stylish and modern - who says you have to give up style when travelling with a baby! Our room was the Palm Sugar room and situated in a corner and at one end of the saltwater pool. While it is true that you have to mostly keep the curtains drawn to maintain your privacy, the lights in the room were sufficiently bright and we had no issues with opening the curtains for the living room area while keeping the curtains for the bedroom area drawn. One con of this particular room is that the cleaners' station is right outside the room, and we could hear them laughing and talking for at least 45 min continuously one afternoon when my son was napping, and it isnt conducive if you are a light sleeper and wish to get some rest in the afternoon. One big drawback was the weak wifi signal in the room - we could only connect to the wifi on a very intermittent basis and noticed that most people sat outside their rooms to use their gadgets as there is a wifi base at the pool where the signal is much stronger. Beware of the mosquitoes when you do that though and make sure the mosquito coil is lit at night outside your room! The staff at the hotel are all friendly and helpful, and each one of them speaks very good English. They were all friendly towards my toddler and often stopped to laugh and play with him. We booked our Angkor Wat full day tour with the hotel and got a relatively good guide who did not pressure us or scam us but was instead accommodating of our son. The tour also uses a hotel tuk tuk driver and when we decided to come back to the hotel before lunch to freshen up and to let my son rest before continuing in the evening, neither the guide nor the driver kicked up a fuss and obliged. We were grateful for the flexibility and their obliging attitudes. The hotel even told us to use the tuk tuk driver to head out for lunch as we had already booked him for the whole day. The saltwater pool is a welcome respite from the heat and the temples and while it may be a wee bit deep for children (my 1.8 m husband could not touch the pool floor at one end but the water was probably around 1.3 m on the other end), toddlers and babies can still frolick on the wide steps of the pool quite safely. My husband and I also took turns to try the spa, and while the massages weren't particularly outstanding, the service was warm and friendly and there is a 30% discount during a certain period of time (10 - 3pm if I am not wrong) which results in very reasonable prices. I also liked that they were not queasy serving a pregnant woman (me!) which I have noticed to be the case in many spas in Thailand. As for food, the restaurant has baby chairs, and even provided colouring paper (animal cartoons with fcc logos, so definitely custom printed) and a colour pencil for my son. However, we did found the lunch food to be mediocre and never went back for another meal. Breakfast wasn't too bad (we liked the English sausage and egg muffin, and the toasted banana bread with passion fruit butter) and can be served in room provided that you inform them ahead of time but you can tire of the limited choices after a few days. The hotel is very close to the town centre, and in particular Pub Street (which is the touristy part filled with restaurants, bars and shops) and there will always be tuk tuks waiting outside the hotel to take you to your destination. A one way trip to pub street from the hotel is 2 usd and this seems to be the standard fare as we never paid more than that for the return trip. The hotel is also located just next to the river, and we took a pleasant stroll with our son one morning along the river and he was quite happy to see stone animals such as crocodiles and deer by the riverside.

This was very helpful to keep them from flying into your room. They offer every guest a complimentary foot massage at the spa, which is great after a long day of temple touring. And breakfast can be delivered to your room as early as 4:30. Which is perfect when you are planning to go see the sun rise over Angkor Wat. Over all I would say our stay was perfect.
