The carpets (both in the room and in the common areas) were stained and worn. There is a charge for internet access. We booked one night through Priceline and one through Hotwire. On one night we were charged an additional $9.96 for an amenities fee and the other an additional $15 for room tax. Not that it's a big deal, but the fees were unexpected and something that anyone planning to book through either Hotwire or Priceline should be aware of. Check with the extremely helpful staff about places to eat. We found good restaurants from both the bellhops and the desk staff. There are a lot of not so good and overpriced restaurants nearby, so it's really important to ask around rather than to just read the posted menus, which we did on our first night, to our regret. Not particular to this review--if you want a rental car, Charlie Car Rental had the best rates we found and, again, a really friendly and helpful staff. They will pick you up at the airport or your hotel and return you to either. The airport location is open 24 hours a day but the downtown location is just open during the day. Nice new cars at reasonable rates. You will need a car to visit the rain forest. If you do go there, be sure to take a tour with the park ranger.
