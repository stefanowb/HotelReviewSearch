Not only was this really disappointing news it was delivered with indifference, sneers and giggles. I all my years, I have never had this happen. The staff is extremely young and inexperienced. For the ensuing duration we stayed there, the check in staff and manager ignored us upon entering the hotel repeatedly. No eye contact, or \"hey, Im really sorry about what happened\"...nothing. I asked not to be charged for night #1, but a message left on my phone from the manager said they couldn't do that. I did receive a 50% comp for my stay, but in all sincereity, my family and I were extremely upset for the entire stay. Regarding the rooms... they are very small and very little walking space as the furniture in there is too large for the space. There was no where to put luggage, except on the floor by the door. No true closet and a reluctance from the housekeeping staff when I asked for a few extra towels. The beds are very hard and the mattresses very thin.Wow, all for $700/night. Unfortunately, it takes an awful experience to sit down and write this review. I have had some great stays all over the world since my last review, but didn't take the time to thank them on this forum. I apologize for that and I will do so.
