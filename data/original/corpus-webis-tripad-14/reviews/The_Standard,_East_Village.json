We didn\u2019t have such problem, but when taking the elevator we could clearly hear the noise. Their restaurant is not open yet, but it should open in May, I think. The staff can arrange for food, however, from nearby eateries. Their 2nd floor lounge/bar is now open; a nice spot to start your evening in the city. The staff does not get any better: extremely professional, friendly, and helpful. I was very pleased with my stay here.
