The rooms are large, quiet, very nicely furnished, clean with very comfy beds and great views of the Animas River or the town of Durango. We always request a balcony room on the top floor. Try to request a room closer to the middle of the hotel if you can, as the rooms at the very end are a bit noisier, getting noise from the converging roads on both sides. The bathrooms are large and very clean. The closets are nice-sized and come with more than the usual 6-8 hangers for your convenience.
