It is a charming Art Deco building close to South Beach and all the wonderful and colourful architecture that certainly lived up to our expectations. We had a friendly welcome from the reception staff and were given the Penthouse Suite. The hotel has five floors and the fifth floor is one very large suite. It was super, very modern and well furnished with a huge bed and large bathroom. The hotel itself reminded us of a Spanish hacienda and had a laid back ambience, but with much attention to service and detail. The restaurant was good and breakfast offered the usual choices and a constant supply of good coffee. The hotel is close to all the main sights and we enjoyed the night life on South Beach and the shops on Lincoln Drive. You can take a local bus to downtown Miami for a great day out on Biscayne Bay and sail round the 'homes of the stars'.

Upon arrival an hour later, the same man (Marc, the seemingly all-purpose valet/bellhop/front desk attendant) remembered me from my phone call, collected my bags, and congenially encouraged me to explore the local area, supplying me with detailed suggestions of where I might walk and dine for the next couple of hours before my room would be ready (approximately 2pm, still earlier than the standard 3pm check-in time). After wandering Collins and Ocean Drive, and a terrific cheap lunch at Cuban hole-in-the-wall Puerto Sagua just around the corner, I returned to find that the hotel had upgraded me to one of the poolside villas. Marc even proclaimed that it would be \"way too big\" for just one person for a one-night stay. He swiftly took my bags to the villa, which was a STUNNING 3-story townhouse-like \"room,\" complete with a luxurious living room, spiral staircase, two full baths, two huge flatscreen TVs, a better-than-average stocked bar, a king bedroom, two full balconies, and a private rooftop sunning deck. Marc carried my heavy suitcase to the second floor up that rather unwieldy staircase (sadly, I suppose expecting a mini elevator would be gauche in these already over-the-top accommodations). One incident that I believe another reviewer spoke of was the surprise evening visit from two housekeeping staff, who were cleaning my bedroom while I was in the bathroom area. I walked out -- SURPRISE! The housekeeper was polite and extremely apologetic, so blowing my top would have been a tad awkward and called for. Next time, bolt the bottom floor front door. Also, to open the gate to the villa, pull the metal bar up. I was forced to make an embarrassing call to the front desk to find out how to work this strange contraption.", "title": "Service is only good until you have a problem with them...", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "MataHari_OnTheRun", "date": "June 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 132207024}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The \"room\" overlooks the small pool and cabana area, making the villa feel extremely private.
