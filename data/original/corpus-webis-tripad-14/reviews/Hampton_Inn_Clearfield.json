She said no they did not (causing me to worry) and that she could only check in all three rooms together. When I continued to argue, she realized that one party did check in. So she said that she needed to check in the remaining two. I argued again that I only wanted to check into one room. She finally said that was doable. Then I told her that I wanted the room on my credit card, not the one used to hold the reservation. She said that she could not do that. In the meantime the third party came to check in. After pressing many buttons, she printed out two confirmations on my credit card and one on the third party's card. In the end we went to our rooms not knowing how much or on what cards the rooms would be charged. She told us that it was only her second day on the front desk. The next morning the very competent girl at the front desk seemed to straighten everything out. She said that the girl from the day before had been working for three weeks on the front desk.
