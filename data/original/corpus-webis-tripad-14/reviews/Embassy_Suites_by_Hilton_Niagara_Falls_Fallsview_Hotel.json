We didn't go with any coupon specials. We stayed for 1 night with supposedly fallsview & jaccuzi. When we checked in, we were told we could upgrade and have a better view for an extra $30. I felt since we didn't book with any specials, we should have been given an upgrade without paying extra. We didn't want to spend the extra $30, and we thought we were already paying for a fallsview room. The room we got was on the 28th floor & the only view we saw was the edge of the falls. My husband & I felt cheated because we paid for a room that included fallsview, NOT edge/side view. We also wanted to see the fireworks. The only fireworks we saw was the reflection off the Oakes hotel. The furniture was old looking/faded. The room smelled. I guess this was why the window was open when we came in. There was no fridge. I can't believe, this is a Hilton hotel with no fridge!! We have always wanted to stay at the Embassy because its location has the best view of the falls. You have to pay an extra $10, total of $30 for parking your vehicle. Better to go to a different hotel & have the option of parking it yourself.
