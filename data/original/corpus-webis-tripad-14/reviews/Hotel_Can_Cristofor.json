Charming, modern, design, relaxed, friendly, beautiful and on top of that a gourmet kitchen! We stayed in both new wing and the main building since we had so change room for one night. Definitely recommend staying in the new wing where the rooms a larger and have a balcony with a nicer view. Although both rooms where in top condition, modern and nicely decorated. Great bathrooms with bathtub and separate shower. Nice amenities. There is a charming modern spa with treatment rooms located in the basement in the new wing. There is also a modern and well equipped fitness room, but much to our disappointment, no air-condition. Thus, extremely warm. In the garden there is a good sized and pretty swimming pool surrounded with many nice sun loungers. The garden in itself is so pretty and peaceful. A great outside lounge area next to the reception. If weather doesn\u2019t permit, there is also a pretty and comfortable lounge area indoor. Large and attractive restaurant with an outdoor seating area. Had one excellent dinner here. Breakfast not very large, but sufficient and tasty. It\u2019s not a 5 star hotel, but doesn\u2019t pretend to be either. Service if correct, friendly and pretty swift. But don\u2019t expect someone running around taking orders by the pool area, although drinks, food and snacks can be ordered in the restaurant or at the reception and will of course be properly served and presented. Come here to chill out. It\u2019s not by the seafront (although not far away) but it\u2019s a perfect location making daytrips exploring the surrounding area.
