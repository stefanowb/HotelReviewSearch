It is small but perfectly formed. The location just a couple of streets behind the Champs Elysees puts you in the heart of Paris - you can walk everywhere. The bedrooms are definitely on the small side, but are well-appointed and the bathrooms are very good. Bar and room service prices are excessive, but that's just a small downside at a hotel so close to so many food and drink options. What marks this place out is the absolutely outstanding staff. Forget the French stereotype of unfriendliness or aloofness. Nothing was too much trouble - from the simple things like highlighting a map with the tourist attractions and checking out store locations, to the much tougher task of finding a gastronomic restaurant at 9pm on a Sunday night in August after being turned away by a full Joel Robuchon.
