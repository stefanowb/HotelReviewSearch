But we needn't have worried. We arrived late to the hotel but they had waited for us to arrive (even though we had been given the code for the key lock. We had a corner room facing out on to the street and the church that so many other reviewers have made mention of. We went down to the restaurant on the first night and even though the kitchen was closed they knocked up a nice salad, creamed cheese and pretzels for us to accompany the lovely wheat beer. Next morning we discovered that there's a decent coffee machine in the foyer along with pastries, cake and fruit - all for free and certainly enough to get us started each day. The room itself was a bit warm and there is some noise from the road out front but I'm a light sleeper and I wasn't troubled by it. We heard the infamous church bells once on a Sunday morning and only briefly. We had a proper sit-down dinner at the restaurant on the third night and it was good-value Bavarian fare and not nearly as pricey as some of the places in the city centre. It is a little out of the city centre but nearby transport is ample. The 52 bus runs straight into the centre from out front of the hotel and Fraunhoferstraube U-bahn station is a quick walk across the river. It's very closeby the Deutsches Museum and the wonderful Wirthaus In Der Au Bavarian restaurant is just round the corner. As mentioned it's very closeby the river and it's a wonderful walk. We'd happily return here and recommend it to anyone visiting Munich.", "title": "Fantastic hotel at a reasonable price", "user": "JayneAndD", "date": "June 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114834169}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed 4 nights, clean rooms, good breakfast.

This was particularly frustrating because the room and the beds were comfortable with a clean modern bathroom. Other irritations were poor lighting for reading and unlined curtains which allowed a significant amount of unwanted light to seep into the room room at night. I'd suggest asking for a room at the back of the hotel away from the road which would solve the noise and excessive external light problem.

We were a bit concerned after having read an adverse review on trip advisor. However, we really enjoyed our stay. While it's true that it's not close by a subway station, there's a bus stop 50 metres from the hotel and buses leave for the city centre every 6 minutes or so. Travel time to the city centre is 5 - 10 mins. The room was fairly small (we found that to be the case throughout our travels in Europe) but the bedroom and bathroom were clean and well appointed. Would recommend that you ask for a room not facing the main street as I imagine those rooms could get noisy. Our room faced the courtyard and we had no problem with traffic noise. There is a restaurant downstairs, we dined there one evening and really enjoyed the food. Noise from the restaurant was never a problem even though we were there over the weekend. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Room rate was 68 Euro and we thought that was good value. Breakfast was nice, but at 22 Euro for 2 people seemed quite expensive when seen against the room rate. Watch out for the cost of bottled water from the minibar - $A7 for 500ml. Overall not sure how the Altmunchen compares with other Munich hotels but we would definitely use it again.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 27, 2005", "id": 3089740}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "do yourself a fover and pick another place", "text": "Where to start!!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 3, 2004", "id": 2511052}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great little place", "text": "The hotel does not have air conditioning, and is located on a very busy and noisy street, which does not really stop through the night, making getting a restful night of sleep difficult.
