That was not the case this time. A friend and I went for 1 night of gambling on a Thursday. We stayed at the Great Cedar hotel. Check in was quick and friendly. The room was nothing spectacular but decent sized and clean. The bathroom was good sized and has an additional sink outside. We only spent three hours in the room so I can't say much more.", "title": "Better then Usual", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "vtgambler", "date": "August 24, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3805516}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 27, "very good": 44, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 31}, "slim_ranking": 0.75}
