Great attention to detail - honey and agave offered in addition to the regular sugars, and real butter along with other spreads. The little things show that someone is paying attention!

The front desk was very accommodating and our tickets were ready when we arrived. The breakfast in the morning was good, but did not include biscuits and gravy which we love on vacation. The room was our only issue; it was just not a good suite. With only a partial wall dividing the room with a sofa from the bedroom, it made the bedroom very small and if the sofa was pulled out to a bed, there was no way to get to the coffee pot by the front door except to crawl over. it seemed rather dangerous if there was an emergency and you needed to reach the front door. With only one door to the bathroom the guest on the sofa bed had to go around the bed to get there. The bathroom was well maintained, but again the design was flawed.

It was an expensive rate for points, but I am just a loyal customer. Let me begin by saying the staff was great, and the property was clean. I was not disappointed in that. I have increasingly found that some Marriott Hotels are lacking in access points and good wireless internet. This has happened to me in at least three cities. The management was not very helpful, and offered to give me the number of the Internet company. What? If I am spending a lot of money to stay, I am not the person who should be making the call. This seems to be the question I have been asked at all three places. He told me that the hotel met the basic Marriott requirements....Too bad it did not met my needs.
