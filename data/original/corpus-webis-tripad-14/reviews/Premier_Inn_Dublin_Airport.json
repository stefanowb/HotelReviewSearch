Unfortunately the second time coincided with christmas dinners being held at the hotel, so we did have some noise of people shouting in the corridor, car park, etc. at night. But I guess you'll get this at a lot of hotels at this time of the year. Also the fire alarm went off briefly, waking our 3 month old baby.
