The hotel website pictures are accurate, the hotel is beautifully appointed and maintained. The hotel itself fits within its rustic surroundings, while remaining luxurious and unpretentious. Perhaps because each unit is owner occupied/owned, but nothing is warn, the bed extremely comfortable, carpet and couch clean. It was as if the suite was turned over for its new owners - us. We stayed in a Q Suite on the 3rd floor. It was enormous and bright, vaulted ceilings making it feel more so. The room felt uncluttered, without feeling empty. The room was serene, and the bathroom more so. I ordinarily do not to use hotel bathtubs, however, this one could not be missed. I had the chance to see several other rooms (same class / lower floor, executive and Presidential) and I feel as if we received the best fit for us. The 3rd floor suites are naturally brighter. The views spectacular. While the executive and Presidential suites are most certainly beautiful, with added extras (aside from size) like small dining tables and outside hot tub (Presidential), we personally found the Q suite more intimate / precious (but not small at 700 sq ft). In other words, we found that we didn't miss a thing (to the contrary) while paying less (USD270/week night - AAA rate) and using the spa more. The spa is quite small, but adequate for a massage or a steam. However, if you're looking for a 'spa retreat' this isn't it. The staff was wonderful, addressing needs promptly. Service gaps certainly occur, however, they were handled professionally. The in-room breakfast menu was terrific, the lunch / dinner menu limited and could use expanding and creativity.

I would have been uncomfortable taking small kids to the pool-- because I would have been very aware of disturbing the other guests. You enter the pool area through the spa--there is no other way to get there, which was kind of unusual and maybe set the tone for that kind of \"spa quiet\" experience in the pool area. Although we didn't try to order drinks at the pool or any kind of food service, it did not seem like the type of pool where you would want to sit around and have lunch or a drink.
