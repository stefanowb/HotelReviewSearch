Hotel is very modern, room was excellent - very spacious with huge bathroom and very clean - we paid slightly extra for a deluxe room, were located on the 13th floor of the tower (would recommend). Breakfast buffet included, good selection although would not recommend the cooked breakfast. Hotel was fine for our 1 night in Cagliari - 25 minute walk to the old town (up hill!) - taxi back from the marina cost 10 EUR. However this is a business hotel and would not recommend for more than a 1 night stay if you are on holiday in Cagliari. Apparently the hotel has a great spa but it's not free for hotel guests and was very expensive. Also had to pay to use wi-fi which i did not expect in a 4* business hotel. Staff were polite & helpful however do not stay here if you want a personable service and Sardinian character.", "title": "New modern business hotel, great for 1 night in Cagliari, would not recommend for a longer stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ma1alp", "date": "July 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 115220098}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Loved it and would definitly go again.", "title": "Loved it.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "cabby289", "date": "October 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119873570}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Went as our first visit to Sardinia.", "title": "Beautiful hotel - no outdoor pool", "user": "AgiCac", "date": "October 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 119531116}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is not just for business people as there was visitors like us from various countries.", "title": "Very pleasant hotel for business and pleasure", "user": "TravelmanEssex", "date": "October 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 119323939}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Went B&B and the breakfast was great with mant choices and loved the bread and rolls.", "title": "A smart business hotel which also caters very well for families", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Chandana", "date": "October 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 119186416}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled on business", "text": "About 200 metres from the bus stop and we went into town in the morning, back to shower and back down to eat in the alleys of Cagliari .
