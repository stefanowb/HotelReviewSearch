"Hi,just back yesterday from the jaz mirabel beach.Beautiful hotel and great surrondings,food was good,plenty of choice for everyone.The hotel has a shuttle bus to naama bay for 38 egpounds return which was good.The only thing i didnt like was the hotel staff coudnt understand you,even the reception staff didnt speak enough english to get by!!i asked what time the shops closed in naama bay,they kept pointing to the shuttle bus,saying yes naama bay!!if you want good service you MUST tip because if you dont they dont bother much.at the buffet restaurants they get drinks for you,if you tip theyll remember you and come and speak to you.we didnt tip first few days and had to stop waiters going past to get drinks,once we started tipping they started welcoming us,good morning,afternoon,evening,how was ur day etc.even in the snack bars they remeber if you tipped and come runing over but if you dont ,they take their time.also too too many russians at the the hotel,quite intimidating at times,since very loud and generally rude.hardly any americans at all,was told they go to other hotels nearby,overall good hotel but i wouldnt go back because i never go to the same hotel twice and also im sure plenty of other better ones out there.thomsons are dear for their excursions,we were on a cruise and stay and did them on the ship,but you can get same excursions in naama bay half price.some traders are very pushy but you have to either ignore and walk by or if you start talking they will try to rip you off with prices and then say we give u discount ,tell me how much ur best price etcalways barter for prices since they double their prices befor giving u discount.also in the hotel newspaper man was walking around selling the sun newspaper and womans own,best magazines for \u00a33 each!!!it was annonying that people expected you to tip all times.beach was disappointing due to sharp rocks ,coral,u had to walk out 10 mins to swim.they have a camel
