The location was excellent. Easy to walk to everything. Parking was no problem. We did park in the driveway , but also had no trouble finding street parking. This may have been because it was not the high tourist season. Our room was OK. The bed was very comfortable. However the room was decent size but they just had too much furniture in it and there was barely room to walk. The TV was circa 1965. It was about 10 inches wide and got about 3 channels. This did not matter to us, but if you do like a room with a TV, you will be upset with this TV. The bathroom was fine. However, they could do better at cleaning the room. It was not dirty but it really could have used a good dusting. I bent down to pick something up and was amazed at the dust on the floor. Also, the moldings on the bathroom doors were really dirty. Just the type of stuff that you don\u2019t have to clean every day but must be done at least every 3-4 weeks and it was not done. Also, there were about 4 wire hangers in the closet. It does not cost much put a half dozen plastic hangers in the closet. One large towel is given per person. It would have been nice to have 2\u2014but it was no biggie. Breakfast is left in the small refrigerator in your room. This worked for us as you can sleep in and eat when you want. It was OK. \u00bd of a grapefruit, a packaged muffin, some cereal, coffee, tea and juice. Adequate but nothing special. There is a table in the room to eat at, but since there was no place to sit out suitcase on, we had our suitcase on the table\u2026so it made it tough to eat. It was disappointing that there was no place to sit outside. In a city known for its gardens and porches, there was not a chair on the porch or a place to sit in a very unkempt garden. This was a drag, since it would have been nice to sit on the porch or in the garden in the evening. The male host was very nice and helpful. He gave us directions, helpful hints and seemed very engaged and eager to speak with us about the history of the city.
