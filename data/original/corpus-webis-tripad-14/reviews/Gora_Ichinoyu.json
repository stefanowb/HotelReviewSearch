As all Ichinoyu Hotels this one was nice as well, good serice and quality for the price you pay, clean facilities, delicious food. Only minus: when you travel by yourself certain rooms with private outdoor baths are either not bookable or you`ll end up paying a price based on double occupancy. Therefor this time I could only stay in a \"western stlye\" room, which was huge and nice. In other Ichinoyu ones I have been able to stay in \"Japanese style tatami rooms\", very traditional and for sure smething you should do when you are in Japan for holidays or if you life here and get visitors.

We were surprised by size of the room as we expected a smaller one but instead it was sizeable and comfortable for even a whole family of 4. Dinner and breakfast was very good and very filling.
