It was furnished with a microwave and mini fridge, the bathroom was clean, and the \"extras\" were just an added plus. The bed was a bit hard for my taste but with hotels they are either too hard or too soft. The hotel offered a large breakfast in the morning which was wonderful: eggs, fruit, sausage, bacon, biscuits, waffles, muffins, 6 different juices and numerous choices in coffees. Also included was a cocktail hour that I didn't partake in but the others also staying for the conference had great reviews of. The facility had a 24 hour gym, courtyard pool, mini store, and access to our daily paper. The area that the Cabot is located in is a bit busy but not too much traffic that I couldn't handle.
