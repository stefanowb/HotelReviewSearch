This package was disappointing and misleading as we actually paid $170 for a carriage ride, a dozen roses, and a bottle of champagne. There was no expanded breakfast, as advertised nor nightly treats with the turn down service. If I had arranged the carriage ride, it would have cost $20 plus $5 for one more person.

The location is great and it is a beautiful hotel. The ladies that serve the continental breakfast were the sweetest ladies ever! We loved the wine reception every evening. We did have one problem that was a little unnerving. We left our room one morning at 9:00am and didn't return until six that evening and upon return the door to our room was open. We went in cautiously and checked to see if anything had been taken. Luckily, everything was fine. We assumed that more than likely housekeeping had cleaned our room and had not shut the door. I was quite upset because we were only lucky that nothing was taken by any passers-by that may have noticed an open door. I called the front desk to let them know my frustration and they just said \"sorry, we'll let the manager know.\" Nothing else was ever said to us regarding this situation. Other than that we had a pleasant stay and will most likely return.", "title": "Great location", "user": "Brandi H", "date": "October 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 141793900}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is definitely recommended if you plan on touring the beautiful city of Savannah.

Just make it back for your dose of wine and cheese."}
