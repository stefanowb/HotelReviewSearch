The first two weeks around Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and the Rajasthan countryside. Then on to Kerala, which was wonderful. The final week at Kumarakom Lake Resort was ideal. The situation is so peaceful with the infinity pool overlooking the lake. Staff were excellent and very helpful. We stayed in a Heritage Villa, beautiffully furnished and comfotable, with its own small pool, but close to the infinity pool. Both restaurants served excellent food but the seafood restaurant produced some of the best fish we have ever eaten. We also spent one night on a hotel houseboat - a lovely restful experience. A terrific place to relax and end a holiday.", "title": "Great spot to relax", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "colin whalley", "date": "March 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155711647}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Arrived from a 2 hour journey, receptionist not very welcoming, had a pool villa with lake view that was great but the pool area was small and took over the whole area so probably better to use the main pool, which we did. Room well appointed. They have 2 restaurants, predominately buffet where you have breakfast, nice staff and Indian families like to eat there both at lunch times and evenings. We prefer al la carte and more of an adult ambience so used the seafood grill. Utter rubbish cocktails the first night, then we found out that they had hardly any stocks left of European wine, they like to push you toward Indian wine that we are not that fond of. However, the food and beverage manager was called and thereafter he was brilliant, checked on us regularly and the food we had for all 3 meals each day were great. The location and cleanliness is perfect, the pool is probably one of the nicest we have had in India, however, the service around the pool was non existent, they were vague about serving any food there and one day we witness a dirty coffee cup on a dirty pool table that was there from 4pm one night to midday the next day. All in all we thought it was excellent, there were quite a few children and I think Indian families are perhaps more indulgent with their children than British families, so it could get rather loud around the pool and in the Etukettu restaurant, also, they let the children eat breakfast in nightwear even though there were signs forbidding this - strange behaviour. The hotel rice barges are amazing, our travel agent booked us with another company, big mistake, ALWAYS use the hotel boats. Great place, away from all the other hotels but Mr Sree made it for us, he was professional and determined to bring this place and the staff up to scratch.", "title": "GREAT LOCATION AND THEY TRY SO HARD", "user": "biffoBuckinghamshire", "date": "March 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155694869}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We only stayed here for one night after a night on a rice boat but it was lovely.
