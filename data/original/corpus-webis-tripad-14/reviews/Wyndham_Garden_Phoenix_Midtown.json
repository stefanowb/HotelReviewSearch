Great staff, great room, sleep number bed (which was fun), and nice property. We also loved the staff. Yes the area may be a little run down, but we found it safe and central to everywhere we went. The light rail is up the road, food is around, and a store close by. Oh, the hotel food was great too, which was a pleasant surprise. Only downer was no heated pool and they needed to turn it on when their temp. dropped. The desk clerk Bizzare was the best (yes that's her name).
