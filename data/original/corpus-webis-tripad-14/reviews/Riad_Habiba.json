Everything about our stay here was perfect. The rooms were nicely decorated and were very comfortable. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to give us information about Marrakech. We ate in the riad 2 nights and the food was freshly prepared and cooked just for us as we were the only residents eating there that night, it was absolutely heavenly and was served up on the roof terrace which made it even more atmospheric.
