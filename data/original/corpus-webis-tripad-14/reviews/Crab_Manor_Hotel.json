Not only is it a wonderful wedding venue but also a great boutique hotel. WE stayed in the Bardola lodge which was nicely decorated and we loved the little lights on the floor. The room was comfortable and nicely decorated with Molton Brown toiletries in the bathroom. The private hot tub topped things off nicely. We saw a couple of the other rooms, which were up in the main manor house and both were nice, the Bora Bora room is absolutely lovely and perfect for a special occasion. The grounds are beautiful, the food was fantastic ( I agree that portions were large but the food was so good that you would have been disappointed with anything less) and the staff were very friendly and helpful.", "title": "A gem!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JosieH", "date": "June 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17292764}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Would highly recommend this place!", "title": "Geat hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mikeymay", "date": "May 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 16426720, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Hot tub, food in restaurant", "disliked": "\u2014 No Ipod docking station, bad bad coffee in the room :-("}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "My other half booked this for a birthday treat for me.
