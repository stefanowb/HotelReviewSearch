If you have been to Olympia, you will know it\u2019s a town built for tourists visiting the Olympia ruin, with one main street that\u2019s half mile long filled with tourist shops, touristy restaurants and small hotels (some of them seem to be very run down), one end of the main street is the bus station, and the other end is the Olympia ruin. Hotel Europa is at the hilltop overlooking the Olympia town (3 minute drive into the town or 10 minute walk down the hill and 20 minute walk back up the hill, so drive if you have a car, parking is free and plenty in town) and it felt more like a resort with its onsite restaurants (more on that later), large guest rooms with full amenities, outdoor pool (large for a hotel pool) and pool side drink and food services. If you are going to visit Olympia in the future, stay at Hotel Europa, there is nothing like it in town, eat at the hotel restaurant, it\u2019s rated No. 1 on tripadvisor for restaurants in Olympia.", "title": "Best hotel in Olympia", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Huskies92", "date": "August 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173844025}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Everyone we ran into were super helpful and friendly (and speak good English). The breakfast buffet has a huge spread of food choices. The best part of the hotel is the restaurant in the garden. We tried what was on the printed menu and what was on the daily special list, everything was simply great. If you go there, you have to try the \u201cfarm dish\u201d, it\u2019s made with local cheese and vegetables they grow in the garden (and I am of the type that considers vegetables should only be side dishes to a slab of meat). They recommended reservations and I could see why. We ate there both nights and the place was full on both nights. It was a mixture of hotel guests and locals coming here for a special meal. To make the reservation, we walked out to the garden and picked a not-yet-reserved table that we wanted. For our second night dinner, we booked a day ahead and picked the table that had a great view of the sunset and the valley, it made our second dinner even better. The price was unbelievably inexpensive for an onsite restaurant in a 4 star hotel, its price was equivalent or even cheaper than many of the small family restaurants that we tried in Greece.", "title": "Better than USA locations", "user": "aprilan265", "date": "August 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173698322}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Total relax in a fabulous location", "text": "Don't think Best Western USA.
