We booked the \"treat your partner\" package, which meant you got a free cocktail and rose petals and chocolates in the bedroom. We arrived too early to check in and were able to leave our bags without problem, though there was an implication by the receptionist that we should have known we couldn't get into the room (we did know, and we also knew they'd look after our bags for us.) When we got to our room there were no rose petals and no chocolates, which made us wonder if we'd booked the right package, although we'd been given the voucher for the free cocktail (only one per person, even though we'd booked for 2 nights - I think you should get one per night of stay). My husband eventually went down to reception to see if we had made an error and were told that we hadn't. Reception apologised and arranged for chocolates to be sent up, though this wasn't quite the same of course as having them in the room when we arrived - my husband made the point that this would have been particularly disappointing if it had been a surprise for me. I did wonder if they would do it for our second day to make it up to us, but our room was bare when we returned on the second day. The room was nice, though a bit small (but I knew that from my previous stay). The beds are comfortable. I don't mind no minibar though I do think free mineral water should be provided by any establishment. That said, there's a Sainsburys round the corner where you can pick up 2 litre bottles of water for 37p. Breakfast was good, though I would prefer not to be given the inquisition about room number and name etc - how many people do they really have sneaking in for a free breakfast?
