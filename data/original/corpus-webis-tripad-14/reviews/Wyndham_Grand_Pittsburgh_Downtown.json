Our hopes were quickly dashed upon check in when the girl on the desk brusquely declined our request with 'well we do have two conventions staying at the hotel', suffice to say they know which class of guests take priority...not ours!", "title": "Can't really fault it", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jimbojetset", "date": "April 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 156422010}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "That initial gripe aside, it was difficult to find any real faults with the hotel. The room whilst not overly spacious was at least well equipped with modern decor and flat screen tv. The bed was very comfy thanks to a memory foam topper. The bathroom was a little small with the most powerful shower in the world though i must say that turning the thing on was a mission in itself as the fixed shower screen meant you had to actually get into the bath to turn it on resulting in a deluge of freezing cold water spurting out over you and the entire bathroom floor!", "title": "No shuttle, Noisy and smoky!", "user": "Robert W", "date": "April 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 156404152}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel is basically still under construction = when that is finished I'm sure the rating will improve - so getting around was for our large event was just a little difficult - the waite staff at the banquet did a fantastic job", "title": "The hotel is basically still under construction = when that...", "user": "Richard C", "date": "March 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155791085}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Pittsburgh"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 232, "average": 430, "very good": 502, "terrible": 115, "excellent": 287}, "aka": "Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.617647058824, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 3.5, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 3.5, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "change Primary photo from ownerphoto edit"}
