They will go the extra mile, or 10 if necessary to make your stay a winner. It is not fancy, it is not luxurious but it is home. While you are there, it is like you are a long lost cousin and have found your way home. All of Maui is like that to me for the most part, however it is over the top at the Pioneer Inn. I don't stay there for an entire 2 week stay, but I love to stay for 3 or 4 nights on the front end and at the end of a stay. It is part of the Ambience of Maui. I think it is also the oldest hotel west of the Rockies. And has a heck of a history. I get up early in the morning and take a walk along the coast. There is no place better for this on the planet. The Restaurant and bar are good too and have good prices. If you want fine dining there are several with in walking distance.I liked Lahina Seafood Company just a block or 2 down the street. Go about 9PM. get a table by the water, it is unbeatable. I recommend it highly.

The location cant be beat, right in the heart of this quaint town. The room was on the small side but clean and besides, who stays in the room in maui except to sleep. The noise from outside is not bad, only one of the nites that we stayed(thursday) u could hear the music faintly(over the A/C) outside until 2am. The rest of the nites were very quiet. Parking is included in the price and was about a block and a half away, which was great because parking is not easy in lahaina. The beach is a 5min drive to kaanapali. The pool is small but very nice with tropical vegetation around it. The town is great with all the small shops/restaurants. We just loved this place and didnt want to leave.

The furnishings and ambience of our room was straight from the late 70's / early 80's. 2) Our air conditioner constantly froze up, was increadible noisy, and basically made staying there miserable. You obviously need a functioning AC unit in Hawaii and we didn't have it. Each time it froze we were instructed to turn it off for a half-hour (is this really customer service?). It was so noisy you couldn't sleep. Be warned - all AC units here are window units and, at least in our case, it didn't work at all. 3) Location - as far as beach access, there isn't any. As mentioned above, great for going out and/or dining, but horrible for getting to the beach. 4) Service - or lack of it. You know about the AC unit mentioned above. They promised to move us to another room after multiple calls about the unit. The next day theys said they could no longer accomodate a move.
