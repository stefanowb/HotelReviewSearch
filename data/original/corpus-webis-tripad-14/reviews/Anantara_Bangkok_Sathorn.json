The room was quite spacious so it didn't seem too cramped for all of us with our big suitcases. The hotel was nice and well maintained. The staff were helpful and nice. The only negatifve thing I can think of is the location. You need to ride the free shuttle to get to the nearest metro stop. If you want to go to the main shopping area (where siam paragon or mbk or central world are located) faster, you are better off in a taxi. Tell the driver to use the meter. It will cost around 80baht. Bring the card that came with your key that indicates the name and location of Anantara Sathorn in Thai to make it easier to communicate with the taxi driver on the way back to the hotel from wherever you are because not all drivers know where it is.", "title": "Nice but far from main shopping area.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "dissolvedgirl", "date": "April 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 158439295}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013", "text": "We arrived not as close to the main part of town as told got to room 2 single beds it was noisy wind blowing through doors as they didn't line up on runners airconditioning didn't work properly so very musky smell when you walked in the staff were nice and the boys at the door very helpful.

We have to wait at the premier room first but only after 20mins later. We waited for two hours for another 2 room suite keys. The receptionist was abit impolite. Its hard to communicate as they dun really knows hw to speak english. But the doorman was friendly. Eventually after we gotten the key, we are pleased wit the room suite. Worthy n its huge. Its look beautiful. The hotel was far from the town area but luckily we hired a driver n van there. The breakfast was also excellent.

The shower and the bath were great. The staffs were very helpful and friendl, extremely good with kids. Our son loved their kid's menu food. We would recommened this hotel to everyone. It is not very far from the train station. We usually walked but they have the shuttle and tuk tuk services as well.Couple of minor things that we didn't like was the last two days we weren't given the bathrobes, the breakfast buffet was a bit simple and not a lot of varities and maybe a liittle more toys in their Crayons room for toddlers. Other than that we had a very enjoyable time there. We had left few things behind and when we emailed them we were told that it has been kept in their lost and found box.
