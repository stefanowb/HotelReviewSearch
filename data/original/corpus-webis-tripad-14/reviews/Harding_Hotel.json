The bar can be noisy on the weekend, but it stops early so not to bad. The breakfast was OK and at 9.50 Euros not worth the price, but did include juice, coffee or tea.

I will say that there was a bit of a serious mix-up on my room the first day, but hotel manager Jonathan Hynes did sort that out very competently and in short order, and made me feel comfortable in the process. The room was (as expected, after reading other reviews) somewhat worn, and had very basic amenities, but was quite good for the modest price. Darky Kelly's, the pub that is physically attached to the hotel, was quite busy every night, but the barkeeps there were most excellent (most especially David - thanks to David for making this solo traveler feel well taken care of). Copper Alley Bistro, the restaurant attached to the hotel, was good - not outstanding, but good, also very convenient, and a great corner spot to watch the people walking about outside the big windows. The luggage storage was very handy on several occasions, and the free Wi-Fi a real plus.
