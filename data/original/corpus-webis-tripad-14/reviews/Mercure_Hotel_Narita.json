It may not be the most luxurious hotel by Western standards, nor have the level of amenities of a 4 or 5 star hotel - but, it's not a 4 or 5 star hotel and isn't meant to be luxurious. The location of the hotel could not be better - it's an 8 minute train ride from the Narita terminals plus 1-2 minutes from the arrival platform at the Narita station via Keisei line (about 340\u00a5, I think).", "title": "Having seen some other reviews I felt compelled to write one", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jim4thetravelpro", "date": "October 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 81998593}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The REAL upside of staying here is its proximity to the main shopping street (exit the hotel, turn right, walk straight -- that's the main shopping street). The breakfast buffet is definitely not the Marriott Breakfast Buffet - but with a little sense of adventure, you can combine both Western and Japanese foods - and learn a little about adapting to another culture. If you really crave American food, just walk 2-3 minutes down the street to McDonald's. The main street has a fantastic noodle shop - Ramen Bayashi. If you want a substantial and cost-effective dinner, try Hero's Grill House - find the JR Station, then Mister Donuts, then walk to the bottom of the hill on the street between Mister Donuts and the police substation and it's on your left. Both the noodle shop and the grill house are very popular with the airline crews so 1. you know the food is good 2. the prices are reasonable and 3. there will be an English menu. Both restaurants are also very popular with the locals.", "title": "See the charm of old town Narita -- and a great shrine", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Chadzilla", "date": "June 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68875587}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The Narita Mercure is also about 15 minutes down the main shopping street to the Naritasan Temple and park -- INCREDIBLE AND NOT TO BE MISSED.

The rooms are not big but above average for Japanese standard. Large and comfortable queen bed and a pretty small shower/toilet cubicle. The restaurant serves a very good buffet breakfast for 1500 Yen. At dinner time they offered (beside the a la carte menu) a Japanese 5 course menu with Sashimi, Tempura etc. for 2500 Yen - all meals I had were very tasty and worth the money. There is also an indoor pool, fitness centre and sauna, but not complimentary for hotel guests (1000 Yen per visit). Limited express trains to the city are only 2 minutes away (Keisi and JR lines). It takes a bit over an hour to get to Nippori (Keisei Line), then another 10 minutes on JR to Tokyo Station. Within short walking distance there are plenty of other restaurants and one of Japan's largest temple area is worthwhile visiting.", "title": "Close to airport and train station, value for money.", "user": "reto6065", "date": "May 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 65325183}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here as a result of the recent air chaos due to the volcanic ash.
