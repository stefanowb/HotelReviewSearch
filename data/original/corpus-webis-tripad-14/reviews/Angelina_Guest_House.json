{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 501, "name": "Angelina Guest House", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "title": "We had a wonderful time!", "text": "My husband and I were going to Key West to attend a family wedding and were looking for accommodations that were reasonably priced. The Angelina really suited our personalities and our needs! It was wonderful to spend time in a quiet atmosphere. We stayed in the \"Trixie\" - comfortable king sized platform bed, microwave, refrigerator, radio. We loved having no TV or phones (although we had our cellular phones)- just perfect for a restful time! The bathroom was nicely sized and included a large shower (no tub, which is OK for us), commode, vanity, large mirror, and moveable plastic cabinet. Everything in our room was spotlessly clean! Robbie took care of our rental car when we checked in, and we did not need it until we left Key West. Breakfast was minimal but fine - yummy homemade cinnamon rolls headlined the bill of fare! The pool is small but we were not there to break any Olympic time trials; Robbie told us the pool is normally shaded by palm branches; the winds from Hurricane Wilma brought down some branches so the pool was in full sun. If you don't wish to use the pool, just relax in one of the chairs or in the hammock. The pool deck is made of brick pavers, which are really easy on bare feet. One nice perk is that you can take towels from the pool area off premises to use at the beach, on a boat, whatever, just as long as they're returned. It's the first time I've visited a place that will permit their guests to do that. The Angelina is in the heart of Old Town, so you can walk anywhere! And, since it's only two blocks from Duval Street, you can enjoy the rowdy side of Key West and have some peace, too! Close enough, but far enough away! I will definitely stay at The Angelina the next time we visit Key West. Kevin, Janet, and Robbie have to be among the most hospitable folks you'll find anywhere!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 9, 2005", "id": 4101905}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best value in Key West", "text": "We had a great 2 week stay at the Angelina.

Unfortunately, we came during a busy weekend, and the only room they had left was the small queen room right next to the front door.The room was named \"DAISY\" It turned out to be a GREAT room! IT is tiny, but has a big bathroom, a good dresser, mini fridge, and cute decor. The fact that it was next to the front door made it easier for us as well.

The staff is helpful and friendly - ask them about renting bikes and they have them there in a snap, ask them to recommend a restaurant and they steer you to a terrific place (usually with coupons), or ask them about an attraction and they book reservations for you. The pool is delightful. The location can't be beat - walk or ride a bike everywhere on the island (and I am someone in his 40s who who doesn't usually ride a bike). Admittedly, the (Free) breakfast is not a gourmet spread and rooms are small and without TVs or phones (my wife and I considered the lack of these a plus, however). If you consider impersonal, cookie-cutter chain hotels a slice of heaven and demand constant cable TV and internet access, then you might think about staying elsewhere, but if you really want the Key West experience (complete cats on-site with free-range roosters in the neighborhood) and have any kind of budget, I can't imagine finding a friendlier, cleaner, more relaxing place in Old Town - unless of course want to to pay much, much more for a room.", "title": "What a Bargain", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "IndplsTraveler", "date": "July 25, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3698037}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great!", "text": "This place was quaint and in the center of everything.
