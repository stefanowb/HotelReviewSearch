I've stayed in many hotels in Manhattan since 1975 and most have had disappointingly small rooms, some were uncomfortable, most were rather noisy, and others had rather dull decor and dull bathrooms. This time, admittedly for a huge price (but a significantly reduced one at that), we had a very large room with fabulous, traditional English furnishings, in wood and silk, that was immensely comfortable. We had a very nice view of Central Park out of two sets of window from the 11th floor. Soundproofing was sublime and the busy world of Central Park South was reduced to less than a murmur from within our room and the hotel overall. The bathroom was generally very good, clad in lovely grey and white marble, and with a delightful separate toilet room with its own door, and would receive a grade A except that the bath was too short -- it was beautifully deep, but about 1 to 2 feet too short for me to be able to stretch out in it. This design was obviously in order to leave room for a nice large shower cabinet (which was just superb, I must say). Dining was generally very good although I didn't like the way they served us sprouts as a side dish with hidden bacon bits which neither of us eat. Service was generally outstanding throughout the hotel, and nothing required more than one phone call to get something which usually arrived pretty promptly thereafter. The concierge was extremely helpful and responsive, and obtained flowers for our arrival and also for presentation to my wife at our celebration dinner. The front desk upgraded us the instant we checked in. These were lovely bonuses that have great value. The final bill for the stay was moderately gigantic, but I'd been expecting it and had braced myself beforehand for the immense cost. But it was worth it and RC definitely helped make it memorable.

We have had rooms with 6th Ave views and Park as well. The rooms are exactly the same but the view of the Park is certainly much nicer! We have also on occasion (this in particular) had Club access, which is nice if you can afford it but certainly not a neccesity. The LaPrairie Spa is great and pricey but worth it! Treatments are great like the Reflexology and 60 minute Skin Caviar Massage. I would strongly recommend it! BLT Market is the new dining room and latest creation of Laurent Tourarndel. It is ok for breakfast and lunch but went for dinner once and would not rush to return. The best restaurants in New York are usually not in hotels. However, the Star Lounge is fantastic for Afternoon Tea. One of the best in the city in my opinion, along with the St Regis' Astor Court. The concierge at the hotel are superb at recommending restaurants and Broadway shows. We like to see 2-3 shows per visit. This particular time we saw Billy Elliot, Radio City Rockette Christmas Spectacular and South Pacifc. They were all WONDERFUL!! We do nothing else but shop during the day, Madison Ave (such as Paul and Shark, Ralph Lauren and Barneys) as well as Fifth (Bergdorf Goodman, Saks, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc....) At night, we eat before or after shows. They recommend the best restaurants in the city such as Le Bernardin, Jean Georges (in the Trump International Hotel and Tower), La Grenouille, Adour Alain Ducasse (in the St Regis), Gordon Ramsay (the London Hotel), River Cafe, Bouley, 21 Club, Gramercy Tavern, La Goulue!!!

At the Ritz, it entails five different food and drink servings a day, all of which are arguably as good as any restaurant in the city. Every detail is absolutely perfect. How about a hotel that gives you a wood shoe box to leave your shoes outside the room door at the end of the day (in one case for me, at 1 am) and the next morning by 7am your shoes are returned polished and shined, complimentary? That's no exaggeration, and probably the most succinct example of what sets this hotel apart. And how about getting on the elevator to go to your room, and one day standing beside the prime minister of Pakistan; then the next day standing beside a very well known hollywood star? No trips out needed to see the famous folks when you are \"in residence\" at the Ritz...
