We've stayed at all-inclusive resorts before in Mexico and Costa Rica, so this was our first \"pay as you go\" deal and we wanted nothing but the best to celebrate our honeymoon. I booked our package through AAVacations and had called the hotel to inform them to reserve the best available room and perhaps do something extra special for our honeymoon. Once we arrived to the property, it was all it was advertised - well maintained, luxurious, trendy open-air lobby, very clean, and yes we did expect kids and balconies with limited space. Admittedly, it was not a hotel for the money we spent as the rooms were not as roomy nor were there a walk out balcony where we can pull in a seat and smoke a cigar or have a drink while watching the sunset. Yet, we were very impressed with the cleanliness and daily/nightly turn-over service by the housekeeping staff. When we first arrived in our room, the ocean/island view was not what I expected so I asked management for an upgrade as it was \"my honeymoon\" and we didn't have a package or anything as I expected upon arrival, so they upgraded our room to a pool/ocean view two floors up and was a major IMPROVEMENT. The rooms, of course, was the same size but we couldn't complain with the upgraded view. The beach and outside restaurant locations across the street from the property was just perfect. We thought the Hyatt was probably the best hotel in Palm Beach, the hotel would have been the best of all Aruba, if the rooms were a bit roomier, had a complete walk out balcony, lower room and restaurant menu prices. Everything in Aruba is expensive (which is why we decided to splurge as it's our honeymoon - smile), so buy your stuff like water and beers from a mini mart (still expensive but half the price of hotel prices) and store them in a mini-fridge upon request and have your meals outside the property. Aruba food is quite the same across the board. We went to Charlie Tomato and Casa Tua for pizza. Went to Madame Jeanette's and Papimento for dinner - I'd go for Papimento purely for ambiance but beware of the mosquitoes there. We were attacked by them, folks did mention to bring bug spray even for the beach-side dinners. We had breakfast at Scala (nothing special), a NY-style bagel place which I thought was great, and DeliFrance - a breakfast haven but requires cab ride as it is close to downtown. We also wished that there were more papalyas on the beach, but surprisingly there were seats available throughout the day - mostly because July isn't a peak time there I guess. Had no problems grabbing pool seats. Wish the pools were a bit bigger though - be warned that there will be a bunch of kiddies if you're thinking of a romantic kid-free honeymoon, but didn't bother us that much since pretty much all of Aruba is kid-friendly. Hyatt was the luxury spot on the island, period. I may have heard somewhere that Riu might be more adults-oriented but we werent as impressed with the beach front area when we walked past the resort. The Marriott properties had even more kiddies and too crowded for our taste, so we concluded that the Hyatt was the best hotel in Palm Beach (I can't vouch for the other areas in Aruba as we are not as familiar with those sections). Although, we did take a snorkeling trip on the Black Pearl which we found really entertaining as we went on two stops and crew service was professional, clean, and impersonal. We also went on a Green Zebra 4x4 tomcar adventure - we enjoyed driving the tomcar, but found the snorkeling and cave stops a total bust. Don't get us wrong as the tomcar was a blast zooting around the national park, upclose look at the wind systems by the beach, a look at the natural bridge sibling, and a top-of-mountain look at all of Aruba and be able to catch a glimse of Venezuela which is only 20 miles away from the island. Really cool tour, but temper your expectations on some of the stops which I thought were unnecessary.", "title": "Great vacation destination for families with teens & tweens", "user": "sa7035", "date": "July 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70148819}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Went for a wedding(37 people) everyone found great things to do.

The Hyatt Aruba is a magnificent property with beautiful gardens, winding paths, and easy access to pools and beach. With the embedded dining and bar areas, you need not leave the premises for all your basic daily needs, ie, sun and sea! BUT BE PREPARED.......Everything available on the hotel grounds (from basic coffee to fine wines and spirits, food, ancillaries, etc) is extremely expensive and overpriced: Banana in Starbucks: USD2. 1.5litre water: USD6.50. Hot dog in Palms Restaurant: USD11. Mixed salad on beach: USD15. The area around the hi-rise hotels is not much better. Expect to drop about USD50 for breakfast for two; about the same for lunch for two (with a soda or beer), and at least USD100 for dinner with a drink or beer. Since nothing but aloe and the land is indigenous to Aruba, everything is imported so the costs are high to begin with. Add this to the opulence of the hi-rise hotel area and you are going to spend bucks to eat. Sure you can do the burger king or pizza experience, but for how long? My suggestion: spring for the in-room fridge. If you dont have a car, have a taxi take you to the nearest super market and lay in a stock of breakfast and lunch stuff, and water / soda.

My Mom stayed here many years ago and said it was lovely, and the reviews on Tripadvisor seemed to back that up but it really fell short. The overall disappointment lay in their service. We went for a baby moon and I was 6 months pregnant at the time. I couldn\u2019t wait to just sit on the beach and relax. At check in we were told our room was not ready so I asked to change in spa or something (as suggested on Tripadvisor) they just told us no and said there was a bathroom near the beach. Changing your clothes in a bathroom stall at 6 months pregnant is not pretty.. oh well (strike one.) We checked at the cabanan for beach chairs and basically they were booked the whole time we were there. BUT I would still recommend this. If you don\u2019t do it there is a stand slightly to the right of the hotels beach area who will rent you chairs and a umbrella for the exact same cost and he can put them anywhere (even in front of the hotels chairs.) So I would do this if I ever went back. We settled for this large cabana with full shade, not bad and you can drag your chair to sun but not exactly what we wanted. Then the service on the beach slow at best. The thing you have to say is the water is AMAZING! And that will not change. Water is warm and calm and I think I latterly stood in the water and swam around for 4-5 hours each day we were there. Our room was also a let down, we had booked a king but there was none available. So we ended up with two queens and the beds faced away from the ocean so our ocean view was of the neon signs of the strip mall across the street. We could go on the balcony and look to the left and see the ocean but when you book an ocean view room you don\u2019t expect this. We had the breakfast included and the service there was a joke. Some of the waiters almost seemed like they were trying to be rude. We even tipped really well the first day to see what happened the 2nd day, not effect on them. Lastly both the beginning of our trip and end of our trip they had large conventions so the beach was always crowded. So even if you had a reserved spot they would put beach chair right next to you. One day we were there they shut the pool down at 4 to set up for a party for one of the groups, I felt so bad for all the families who were kicked out. Then they were stringing live electrical wires above the pool to set up for the band while my husband was still at the swim up bar\u2026 he asked the bartender if the cables were live and they guy just laughed!!! Are you kidding me!!! The beach staff yelled at me a couple of times for bringing my towels back 15 min late (they were still there cleaning) I had watched the sunset and I guess that is not allowed with your towels. The worst part came at the end when the 2nd group that came was an especially rowdy convention and the beach was chair next to chair with people yelling, smoking, playing their radios and parting. We were so grateful this was our last day.

The grounds are lushly tropical, with colorful birds, koi, black swans, and iguanas. There are three outdoor bars, including a swim-up bar in the pool, as well as three indoor/outdoor restaurants. There is also a juice/smoothie bar located right by the beach! We can't say enough good things about the outside amenities at this resort. The rooms are nice, but the bathroom was on the small side. We've found that most Hyatt resorts have very large bathrooms, allowing a couple to be in there at the same time. This was not the case in our room. Please know that most rooms have a garden/ocean view from the balconies; however very few rooms actually have a \"real\" balcony with chairs that you can sit on. We were lucky to have gotten upgraded to a \"sit-down\" balcony room, as most of the \"balconies\" are only deep enough to stand on (about two feet deep). Maybe because we had the sit-down balcony the space was taken from the bathroom? Not sure, because we didn't ask to see another room. The room itself was sufficiently large and the decor was nice enough. The maintenance of our room, however, left a lot to be desired at a $700 per night price tag. The shower door (which was a beautiful frameless glass) was all scraped up from people slamming it and it didn't close all the way, which meant a flooded bathroom every time we took showers unless we used all of our hand towels to build a dam outside the bottom of the shower door. Luckily, the maid service was great and provided us with plenty of towels after they could see what we had to do with them. As a result of this water problem, the grouting between the floor tiles in the bathroom was missing in many places and was in terrible need of regrouting. The wallpaper in the bathroom was also peeling in several places. In the main area of the room, one of the wall sconces on either side of the large full-length mirror was loose and the desk area didn't have a light, which would have been helpful. The soundproofing of the room could also stand some improvement, as it could be noisy at times with people coming and going and letting their hotel room doors drop closed. On the upside, our view of the Caribbean was fabulous! Our air conditioning worked very well, the water pressure was great, and a ceiling fan is always a nice amenity. We utilized the spa for a couples massage and the masseuses were great. The facility was nice, although it was small and didn't offer many amenities other than a steam room, which didn't even sound appealing given the humid environment of Aruba. We were also amazed to find that the spa's indoor/outdoor relaxation area and treatment rooms are located right next to the children's slide by the main outdoor pool. So, if relaxing and having a couples massage at $290 (pre-tip) with kids screaming outside is acceptable to you, then the services were fine. We, however, would have preferred a different location for the spa. We made a reservation for Hyatt's \"Footprints\" upscale dining experience on the beach (only about five to seven tables). This dining experience includes a four course meal at $72 per person, which includes a choice of appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert. The portions were surprisingly large, tasty, and very well prepared and presented. After the server accepted our order for a $50 bottle of wine, delivered it, and poured it, she then told us that a glass of wine was included with our meal and that she would bring them after we finished our bottle. After asking her why we were not informed of this prior to ordering a whole bottle of wine and that it was not included on the menu, her only explanation was that we should have been told when we made our reservation. We later checked our online reservation confirmation and there was nothing mentioned about any wine being included. We just let this go, although we probably shouldn't have.

I don't agree with this, but space is limited (although there was always some space under the communal palapa it can get crowded). The water had a high level of turbidity and we could not see our feet even when shallow. Went to baby beach and it was equally disappointing. The pool does get crowded, but we are not pool people so went at end of day to get refreshed and by then plenty of chairs available. The pool is small, so if you just hang by the pool you might not love it here. We opted not to go on a snorkeling trip b/c others at the hotel us it was underwhelming. We rented a car (very easy to get around) and thought Arashi Beach and Malmok looked pleasant and there were snorkelers out in the water. The island is quite dirty (garbage just being tossed everywhere) and dry and rather unattractive. That being said, the Hyatt common areas are really lovely. The Aruban people are incredibly kind and friendly and go out of their way to please the tourists (even the rude ones!). Our rooms were pleasant, clean and comfortable. The food was also okay..Thanksgiving buffet was really nice, Japenga was enjoyable and the breakfast buffet is only worth it if it is included in your room. Otherwise it would probably make more sense to go off for breakfast as there are many restaurants within walking distance. Lots of people brought sandwiches from Subway to eat on the beach, which is probably a good affordable way to eat lunch. Food was generally ok...the best was Gianni's. The butterfly farm was fun, very peaceful, pretty and educational. Lots of motorboat activity on the beach and the water was refreshingly cool (80-82) after sitting on the beach. We took long walks on the beach...you can walk way down in either direction. Virtually no shells to speak of up near the Hyatt, but found some down towards Eagle beach. The water looked clearer their too. On the whole it is kind of like Miami Beach with more reliable weather and slightly nicer water. Lots of great people watching and languages from all over the world. Not gamblers so I can't comment on Casino. They had a great band playing one night...and a guitar playing singer on another couple of nights. It was a good place to go to recharge our batteries, but I wouldn't go back. I would go to Grand Cayman for snorkeling and nature diversions and Turks and Caicos or Bahamas for much prettier beaches. If you are going to stay on Aruba I think the Hyatt is a good choice if you want to be in the thick of things...we felt safe walking around and the Hyatt has good security on premises.

The chairs are then \"theirs\" for the day. So when you come down to the pool or beach at 8:00, all you see are unoccupied chairs with towels on them. People place towels on chairs at both the pool and the beach to reserve their space. One of the cabana gentleman told me this is how it is done. Well this is not how it should be done! The Hyatt in Maui will remove towels placed on unoccupied chairs. As a result there is never an issue of no space. People come and go all day and chairs are always available. The Hyatt Aruba is poorly manged. All guests are entitled to a lounge chair and shade.
