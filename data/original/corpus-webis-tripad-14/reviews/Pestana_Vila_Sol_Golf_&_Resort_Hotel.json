We weren't convinced about this and asked to move to one of the 1800 rooms but changed our mind when they said there would be a 25 euros per night supplement! To be fair, they offered us another of the 1200 rooms with a garden view for no extra cost but we eventually decided to stay put. The frogs croaking could be quite noisy and woke us up a couple of times but didn't bother us. The room decor is now looking dated but the quality of the furnishings is ok and the bathroom was huge with two sinks.

The gym was really good but definitely needs air conditioning as got far too hot even at 8.30 am. The drinks around the pool area were very expensive \u20ac3.85 for a Small coke! The location is not ideal as the nearest supermarket is 1.8 miles away or \u20ac8 in a taxi. The marina is also approx 3-4 miles away and a taxi was \u20ac10.
