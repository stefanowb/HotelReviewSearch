The reviews stating that this is a decent stay must be rigged by management. Here's our laundry list of complaints: The carpet is old, filthy & covered in stains (the kind you wouldn't want to walk around barefoot on). The bedding isn't any better... old & dirty. It is so cheap the beds don't even have a fitted sheet (just a flat sheet barely tucked in), mattress cover or bedskirt. And they are extremely uncomfortable. The fluorescent vanity light flickers on & off when using the outlets near it. So, while drying our hair we had a strobe light show... not easy on the eyes. The shower is dingy looking with brown stains up the sides of the tub and there is extremely low water pressure... so good luck getting the shampoo out your hair. There is only one sink in our double room. There is no ironing board or iron in the room. If you need that or any other \"extra amenities\" you have to trek down to the office to pick it up. At one point during our stay, the toilet (for no apparent reason) overflowed. When we called the front desk, we were told that there was only one person on staff so no one was available to help. We had to walk to the front desk to get supplies to mop up & sanitize the mess ourselves. Our room then smelled like sewage the rest of the night... obviously there are some pretty serious plumbing issues going on as well. To sum it all up, everything about this place is poorly maintained. This was a horrible stay for us... one that we won't soon forget unfortunately.
