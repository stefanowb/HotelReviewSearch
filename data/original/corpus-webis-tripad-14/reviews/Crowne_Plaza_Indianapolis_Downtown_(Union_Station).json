When we arrived, we found it to be a very nice hotel. It was clean, and the people were friendly. It was is the downtown area, right next to the RCA dome. The rooms were big, and clean. The noise from the trains were almost non-existant. I found out that when you reserve, ask for a room that is further from the train. The kid loved walking around the hotel, looking at all of the people statues. The pool seemed nice, as well as the hot tub. Only negative was the restaurant - which was not very clean, and the food was typical hotal chain food. It needs major updating.

This place is Uber-cool inside. I can't describe it, I can only say we really loved the place. I had my wife and 4 teeneaged boys with me. Everybody was blown away about the train cars converted to rooms, and the little glass elevators were pretty neat for the younger ones. I don't care what anybody says, this place is too cool to believe. Took the boys accross the country on the BIG TRIP last summer. We stayed at 14 different hotels, and this place was at least as good as the best we stayed at. When we travel, we typically get double rooms, and the cost per night per room is over $100, so I am not comparing this place with fleabags. I am acustomed to 4 diamond places like the Greenbrier and Hotel Dupont suites.

One would think that since we were paying $140 per night, the experience would be a bit more enjoyable. The rooms were very small and a bit worn down. The furniture had been worn in places, however the bed was absolutely wonderful. We stayed on the second floor with a window facing the atrium/pool area. BIG PROBLEM here... It is so noisy because the pool is literally in the middle of all of the rooms, not to mention there was a children's cheerleading convention in town. My boyfriend and I were exhausted from traveling, and could not wait to go for a relaxing swim or have a soak in the spa. Neither of these were an option because there were literally at least 35 kids in the swimming pool, and 16 people in the spa, many under the age of 12 even though the sign posted says that anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an adult. (?) So we not only could not swim or enjoy the spa, but we also had to endure the ridiculous screaming and yelling of kids until 10 PM. NOT relaxing in the least. I called management and asked if there would be any way to have the pool stay open for adults for about 20 to 30 minutes after the kids left. I explained the situation and told him we can't even get IN the pool for one, and the noise in our room was unbearable. One gentleman I spoke with was very nice and said he would have to check on it and would call me back. No one returned my call. I called down again to follow up and spoke to Terry, who was the manager on duty. He proceeded to tell me in a rude and condescending manner that he would not be opening the pool up for people who were unable to use it during that time. Something about a contract which I understand, but I was surprised when he did not offer any solution to the problem.", "title": "great hotel but expensive parking", "user": "pntballkrm", "date": "December 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12057993, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location is 30 second walk from all bars/central downtown", "disliked": "\u2014 parking rates"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed here for one night, and really enjoyed it.

They are the same star rating: 3 and booked both on Priceline for $50/night. This hotel was far inferior. While the location is really good, easy walking distance to everything central even in 20 degree weather, the hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. The fact that it's in a train station is fun and the kids really enjoyed seeing the rooms in train cars, but it is loud throughout the night. They do give you earplugs, a CD, and a night mask, but I still couldn't sleep. Moved rooms to the third floor from the second on night two and that helped some. The windows face an open atrium in the hotel instead of outside which add extra noise. The interior is very shabby, carpet worn, bathrooms from the 80's or so, bu the beds are nice. Stay away from the restaurant, very run down and much better choices within walking distance. Overall: Okay for Priceline, but not if you pay full price.
