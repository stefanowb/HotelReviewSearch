Don't expect western standards. That said, this hotel has some positives. It has a great location inside the Shu Nan Zhu Hai Park itself. The room included wi-fi. AC was cold and plugged in. There was lots of good hot water at all hours. The food in the restaurant was pretty good as was the breakfast with lots of local dishes featuring mushrooms and bamboo, although it is strictly Chinese food on offer. However, the negatives to this hotel are rather substantial and I would look elsewhere if I returned to the park.", "title": "A roll of the dice", "user": "badwaiter", "date": "September 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 177638741}], "location": {"country": "China", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Changning County"}, "review_count": 1, "aka": "Shu'Nan Hotel China/Changning County, Sichuan"}
