If you are into gourmet food then this is a great place for you. If, like us, you are travelling with children then beware. We had booked the restaurant not knowing it was such haute cuisine and when we asked for something plain for our son, the kitchen found it very hard to comply. Firstly the adult meal with sauce and 'violet artichokes' appeared. Then we politely asked again for just plain beef it came back overcooked with some very strange form of mashed potato. My son ended up dining on the mars bars I had packed that night. I have to say that the staff were quite rude and unhelpful during our meal and it was not a pleasant experience.

Parking was limited when we stayed because the hotel was full - we had to park further up the road in a seperate car park but we did have a space each night. The evening menu is limited unless you are a francophile and very expensive so we chose to eat out.
