Last year we had stayed at the Homewood Suites in La Quinta (that property has closed) and had been turned off by the churlish, imperious attitude of the guy working the at the Front Desk. We couldn't believe our eyes when we saw the same clerk is now at the Palm Desert location! He just can't be bothered (or should I say that everything bothers HIM). This property is sparkling new, but right off busy Cook Street. We requested a room away from the noise. The clerk put us in a room facing construction! After jockeying around trying to find a room that seemed to suit HIM and not US, we were finally given a wonderful room which was quiet and spacious. However, the clerk told us that we'd have to move after a couple days because another guest was going to be arriving. This made no sense to us. There are about 4 floors of rooms there, and we were settled in. I'm a Hilton Honors member besides. We checked out early because of his ungracious attitude (albeit reluctantly) rather than change rooms and have to go through that all over again.. The rooms are wonderful and everything is clean and new. The kitchens are on the small side, though, compared to Residence Inns. There's not much by way of a view, and the hotel is in an area that will ultimately be a corporate park. But it's very convenient to freeways, stores and golf courses. We enjoyed our abbreviated stay and can only hope that the hotel hires some new front desk personnel who understand that the customer needs to be satisfied graciously.", "title": "New Property - Same Attitude", "user": "Criticaltraveller", "date": "January 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 53569698}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Newly built spacious hotel, typical of the \u2018Homewood\u2019 brand.

We have been to two others over past years in different states. First it is great staying in a new hotel. Everything is clean, bright and well kept up at this hotel..The \"kinks\", that were mentioned in earlier reviews were ironed out. Our computer and cell phone worked great at this Homewood Suites Hotel. The beds (we had two queen sized beds) were very comfortable. It was nice to have a kitchen. The price we got was very reasonable for what we were given. It was nice to have a real livingroom with a big flatscreen TV, as well as a separate bedroom with another flat screen T.V.
