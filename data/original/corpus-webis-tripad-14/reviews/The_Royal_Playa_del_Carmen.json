We booked our reservation and flights through the Real Resorts website for the first time and were delighted to have the entire process handled quickly and accurately. Check-in was easier than usual but after all we knew the drill and there was no sign of 'Real Club' staff looking to schedule us for a conversation. We loved our suite's 2 balconies, had a nice view of the pool and despite our location (furthest away from the beach), we could even see the ocean. Our room (#747) was in the newer, detached part of the resort and was furthest from the beach and pool but we enjoyed having the coffee bar and the Mediterranean Restaurant just steps away from our door. The distance from the pool and beach resulted in a very quiet stay and a longer walk to those areas but the walks were always enjoyable! The resort was busy with weddings during the Valentine's week and we felt some sympathy for the wedding parties that had to endure blowing sand and gusty winds. We were overwhelmed and at times annoyed with pillow choices and the fragrances that the resort thought would help create a romantic atmosphere in the room. We enjoyed great beverage service (pool and beach) from Maggie and Ruth and our housekeeper cleaned our room and turned down the bed every evening. A very delightful 8 day stay that reinforces this property's status as one of our favorites!", "title": "Always a Favorite!", "user": "GOmaha", "date": "February 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153204198}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just Book this place...the location of this resort can not be any more ideal.

The hotel is beautiful, but there are alot of beautiful hotels, so service has to be your top priority and that is what we got. And there was also our cleaning lady that was absolutely wonderful, I cannot remember her name. The gentlemen that came to fix our hot tub, which I cannot remember his name either. There were so many employees in different restaurants that went above and beyond that contribute to the good memories of this place. Didier Vargas, in the reception area made sure we were moved to a quieter room (construction was going on when we went) & got us the best view of the playa, so nice, also stayed on top of getting our hot tub working correctly.

This was a really great vacation. The check-in went smoothly, our rooms were beautiful and all located close to one another. We loved the ambiance at the pool even though there are no sun umbrellas at all. The service on the beach in the cabanas was really good; we did found though that the cabanas were all too close to one another. It would have been nice also to have some sun huts on the beach so that we can take a long chair and isolate us from the crowd. The week we were there, the ocean was quite agitated by wind and waves; 2 of our friends are not good swimmers so we were'nt able to be all together in the ocean at the same time. I have to say that there were a few rocks here and there and therefore the ocean did not compare at all to my last experience in Negril, Jamaica. The food was good, the activities numerous and the personnel quite charming. I love that every person working in this hotel would acknowledge me by putting their right hand on their heart. To **Victor**, Katie, Yorge, Asu, Ivonne, Alberto, Armando, Jeronimo, Antonio and all the others, thank you for making my vacation a pleasant experience. I loved the service box in my room and the turndown service. The hotel store had a good variety of gifts and let me tell you, we shopped like there was no tomorrow.

You really feel welcomed from the moment you enter the resort. The rooms are absolutely beautiful and always very clean and well stocked. The food is presented well at all a la carte restaurants and very tasty. The buffet styles are also very good. We felt like we had the opportunity to wine and dine every night. Again, the service is great everywhere you go. They are all so friendly! My favorite place for meals was the El Meditterraneo. The staff there was just the most caring and welcoming and the food was my favorite for all 3 meals. You have the choice of buffet or a la carte and it has air conditioning! I also like the fact that the Coffee House is just next door and the quiet pool is there also. There was a special little man there that worked as maintenance and cleaning. He has a beautiful smile and works very hard. I believe his name is Gaviel. Paco and Roberto are also 2 waiters that we really liked. The pools are very nice and well kept. Pool water is a little cool but also refreshing. My other favorite place to have lunch was Pelicanos. The scenery is really nice and the food is very well presented and good! The Entertainment team are all very kind and friendly but not too pushy! We participated at a cooking class at Chef's place with Regina and this was alot of fun! Take it if you can; it is free and includes recipes and lunch! Now, for the beach front, there is a very nice man that wears the title of beachtler called Alexis. This man plays a huge role in the service at the beach and even at the pool. He is very kind, friendly and really makes your trip unforgettable. At the beach, we also got to know 2 wonderful lifeguards; Manuel and Rafael. They both have very nice personalities and make your day even more pleasant. The beach is somewhat crowded but the beachfront is limited in space. I preferred the beach in the morning and the pool in the afternoon. The only thing that I would recommend is some music at the pool. It feels really too quiet sometimes in the afternoon and after the water exercises, I was often disappointed that they shut the music off. I have so many nice things to say about this resort. We went to the Spa one morning and the service there is also amazing! We really enjoyed this. We had special treats when we returned at night like lit candles and some chocolates at the bedside. We took the time to go shopping on 5th Ave. one night and it was fun but also very crowded. It feels weird that the resort is so close to this commercial area. Once you cross the lobby it is another world. I loved the gift shop in the resort. It has alot of nice gifts including a nice jewellery collection.

I didn't post a review of our first visit two years ago but as everyone knows who travels, Tripadvisor is a great place to check up on everything before you leave. First, everything has been pretty much covered but I will tree top. All rooms a teriffic. The ocean view rooms are just that but you have to be on the balcony to see the ocean as the layout of the resort is a horseshoe design. Spotless and impeccably attended to. The only complaint one of our guests had was that there was no Dewars on the property. The help is....helpful and fun. My favorite is Jaime, the pool butler. The entertainment staff was great and it's nice to see that they are all still there. The restaurants were rated by our travellers from good to great. Remember, you are in Playa del Carmen, Mexico and not cosmopolitan Manhattan. If you don't like something, order something else or try a different venue as it is an all inclusive. I agree that the hot tub is warm, the pool is cold but come on...you are on vacation!!! Is the sky too blue and the ocean too many shades of aquamarine? For our travellers from the north, congratulations on your Super Bowl win but I am beginning to wonder if you could be happy anywhere as witnessed to mostly negative reviews on everywhere they travel. This place overall is a great value. 5th Avenue, Playa del Carmen IS NOT Manhattan. If you think that because the Avenue is similar to NYC it is not. Again, this is old town Mexico. Quaint, bustling, and vibrant for a resort town. You won't be disappointed. We stayed at the Valentin(2 times), Dreams(2 times) and Barcelo resort. The Royal has it all. Service, amenities, food, location. The little things such as the magic box, 24 hour room service, a nice cold beer or mixed drink in your room after a hard day of leisure by the pool or beach is just the icing on the cake. Where else can you go for 7 days stay on the beach and have everything paid for just $2,800 all in? A house on the beach at the jersey shore runs $6000+ for a week and my wife still has to cook and clean.
