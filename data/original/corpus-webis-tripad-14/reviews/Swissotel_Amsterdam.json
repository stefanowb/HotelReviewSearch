I had taken my Mother with me on this trip and she had arrived from Chicago a very weary traveler. Since no regular rooms were ready when we arrived at 10:00 Am the desk manager was kind enough to upgrade us to a granite covered two room suite for the duration of our trip. Of course as a gentleman I was sure to take good care of the person as I would suggest any courteous traveler who is looking for an upgrade might consider. Fabulous room complete with an endless supply of Lavazza expresso from an automatic machine. Very comfortabe beds. Spotless even in the public areas and located next door to the palace and walking distance to central station. You can catch a train to schipol every 10 or 20 minutes. Catch the local train right out front for a ten minute ride to the museums etc. Flower market is like two blocks away. Will be back here soon!

All major sites are within walking distance, or are accessed quickly via the city's tram network (which again stops in front of the hotel).

Do note that should your room be at or near the front of the hotel, street noise (especially the trams) can be heard in the room with the window(s) closed. This is not a sound-proofed building. My travel party occupied 2 rooms during our visit. I was in a room near the front of the building, hence the noise previously described. My companions occupied a room near the rear of the building with a view on to an inner courtyard-type space. Their room was totally noise-free. I would like to make special mention of the hotel staff. Everyone employed by the hotel that we had contact with throughout our stay was very polite and very helpful. The front desk staff in particular were always knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. Also, the hotel's \"Business Center\" offered 2 computers with free internet access.
