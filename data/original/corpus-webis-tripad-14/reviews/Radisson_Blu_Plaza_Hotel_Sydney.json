The location was ideal for business travelers and families. The Opera House was a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There was also a train station about 5 minutes away. The rooms were large and clean. The only downside was the fee for internet service. I paid $50 for just one day. All in all, I would recommend this hotel.", "title": "Very happy with the Radisson", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "amkaplan", "date": "July 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8249029, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and comfort of room", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 24, "average": 80, "very good": 357, "terrible": 15, "excellent": 841}, "aka": "Radisson Sydney", "slim_ranking": 0.0486486486486, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel Sydney is an intimate, boutique style, five-star hotel housed within a stunning heritage-listed building and located in the heart of Sydney.
