So not sure if this was the case with some of the previous comments but we found the staff to be lovely and we had some great chats with the restaurant staff throughout our meals.

We did tennis and biking and jet skis. The staff are friendly and make you feel special 24/7. To get to the island you take a dedicated speed boat or cable car- all free for guests. And the best part of our stay? The food was ALL FREE!! (Three meals a day). Not sure how long that offer lasts-as it seemed too good to be true, and yet it was true.
