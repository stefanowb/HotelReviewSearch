If the argument is that rarely guests fill the bathtubs these days, we are still on the same side of argument. If most guests take shower standing up in bathtub, it makes more sense converting that space into a lavish-spaced shower cubicle and leave bathtubs to be offered only only in premium category rooms as people looking for absolute luxury generally do not care much about saving environment.", "title": "housekeeping", "user": "Terry D", "date": "May 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 160247024}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Coming back to this hotel, as for breakfast, the spread was extravagant, local and global foods mingling well.", "title": "Excellent Housekeeping", "user": "rebann2003", "date": "May 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159952816}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Overall, certainly a nice apartment hotel for those who look for a quick access to Bur Dubai and charms of the old town.", "title": "Very nice stay in movenpick bur dubai.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Azu R", "date": "May 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159815530}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "hello fellow travelers,", "title": "good location and helpful staff", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "sanghiaanchal", "date": "April 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 158002100}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed at this hotel for 3 days i think the location is close to many good malls like the dubai mall, diera city center and dolphinatorium.", "title": "Good - But not Dubai's best.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "MillyJacobs", "date": "April 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 157812072}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled solo", "text": "The breakfast here is amazing with good English and Indian spread and the staff is excellent friendly and helpful.", "title": "More Than I Ever Dreamed", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "lynnjoyso", "date": "April 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157805649}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled solo", "text": "but i really dont think i would rate this as a 5 star property but a 4 star property definetely yes:)", "title": "Amazing unforgettable experience", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Mohamed D", "date": "April 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157731237}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "If you are looking for a hotel in the busier, metropolitan area of Dubai (downtown Dubai) near the Dubai Mall and the Burj Khalifa, then look elsewhere. I, however, enjoyed how the Moevenpick Bur Dubai was located about a ten-fifteen minute drive in a cab from the downtown Dubai area with the Burj Khalifa, and set back from the main road. It meant less noise at night, and just a quieter, homelier setting altogether. But don't worry, every single taxi driver in Dubai knows where the hotel is, knows the hotel itself, and can get you there no problem, and it's not inconveniently far away from anything, either. There is a small shopping mart right next to the hotel that is great for small supplies whenever you need them, but if you're running late or have just come back from a busy day out, and can't be bothered to go out to a fancy restaurant for dinner, then I would easily recommend the amazing room service. The hotel offers 24-hour room service, but if you're staying in an apartment off to the side of the complex rather than a hotel room/suite, then the room service takes about half an hour to arrive (45mins if after around 9pm) The tenderloin steak and the grilled chicken from the restaurant default menu are great (definitely worth the price), and for drinks - any alcoholic beverage, or the fruit blend smoothie!", "title": "More like four star hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Vividsmyle", "date": "April 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 157583120}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I found all of the housekeeping staff to be very helpful and happy in their work.They where happy to insure I had everything needed to make my stay great.Shihab,Saddam and Sinod took time to ansewer my questions and make sure my needs where taken care of.Mynul the supervisor stop in to check as well.It is helpful staff as this that make my choice to return easy.I would hope they are well paid as they are a credit to this hotel.", "title": "Housekeeping", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mark j", "date": "May 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159771447}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "This is my 2nd visit and stayed for 5nights.Was given a room on the executive floor but right next door was the staff service pantry and lift area.So it was noisy during the day and throughout could hear the lifts going up and down.Even my room was facing the hotel small couryard and away from the road...the windows did not seem to be insulated as well as the last room i had so there was the constant noise of aircrafts flying overhead.", "title": "Not as good as last visit", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AsianWorldTraveller", "date": "May 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159641800}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The shower was really annoying.The water temperature kept on fluctuating between hot and cold to piping hot.Even after adjusting the tap...it was worse.", "title": "Blaid's Stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Blaid K", "date": "April 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 159231531}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Room was as usual huge and spacious and no complaints in that area.", "title": "Nice hotel, but strictly business location", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "paulrb48", "date": "April 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 158543714}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Excellence service and the food was good to.
