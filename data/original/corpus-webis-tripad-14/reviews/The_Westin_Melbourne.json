We loved their Sweet Sleeper king sized bed which was for some strange reason much better than the Sheraton beds in Asia. The indoor lap pool and small spa were nice, but the gym was miniscule and claustrophobic. We attended the solemn 11:00 am service at St. Patrick's Cathedral and hurriedly walked back to the hotel to have Easter lunch at their Allegro Restaurant. The entrees and mains although not buffet style but shared platters were delicious and beautifully prepared. Dessert was buffet with all you can eat chocolate eggs.
