What a disappointment. Our room was located on the fourth floor and was very small, as was the room next door in which our friends stayed. The bathroom was about the size of an average toilet room including a toilet, very small shower and small basin. There wasn't enough room in the bathroom to comfortably get changed in after having a shower. The room was the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in, was clinical white and very basic. The bed was a matress on top of a flat wooden board on four legs - however it was surprisingly comfortable. There was noise outside most of the night due to the area the hotel is situated - lots of bars and clubs. Breakfast was below average - everything appeared chaotic, messy and had been sitting there for a while. The scrambled eggs were clearly made of powdered egg and appeared a gey and yellow colour...yuck! The lifts are extremely slow and the carpet in the halls is well worn and in need of replacing.

Ibis have, for as long as i have known, reputed themselves on providing the basic hotel facilities at a reasonable price and of a high standard, and for us on this occassion they ticked all the boxes. Yes, the room was quite small, but how much time are you spending in there anyway? I can see this could be a problem for people staying for business, but there's always alternatives. The Academy is not 5 minutes walk from the hotel so would highly recommend this to any gig-goer. And yes, the hotel does get a lot of street noise as it is on a main road in the centre of the second largest city in the UK - but what else would you expect? With the window shut it is more than possible to get a good nights sleep. If it's a quiet stay you're after, then go to the countryside. Check in and out was a breeze with friendly staff. The only downside to the stay (and I see quite a few people have commented on this) was the breakfast in the morning - avoid, avoid, avoid. We took one glance at the set up and turned around and walked straight out the door - quickly. However, now that I think of it, we probably would have been better off staying and eating there considering where we ended up!!

We arrived in our room to find that it was very small but for a budget hotel in the city centre the main thing is that it is clean, which this undoubtebly was. After reading the reviews on here prior to our stay we requested a quiet room, we returned to our room at 2am, and the music downstairs was very much present. There is no getting away from the fact that this hotel is in a fantastic location, staggering distance from all the pubs and clubs and 2mins from the bullring for a days shopping but if staying for business or for a quiet break this hotel is very much the wrong choice. However, it was perfect for what we needed and as a base for a night out, we would probably stay again.
