The one that I stayed in was very large, but the furniture and decor were about 20 years out dated -- a sort of Laura Ashley meets flea market style. The walls and floors are very thin. I could hear the person in the room above me walking around and I could hear the person in the room below me snoring! My friend was staying in a newer wing (near the lobby area) and her room was much nicer - done in a tasteful, modern, country style.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Rabidpuppy", "date": "October 27, 2004", "id": 2789235}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 36, "average": 78, "very good": 173, "terrible": 10, "excellent": 498}, "aka": "Pennyhill Park Hotel And The", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Pennyhill Park Hotel and The Spa is a magnificent country house hotel in Bagshot, Surrey, set amongst acres of gardens and parkland including a 9 hole golf course.
