The buffet breakfast, which came with our room, offered a wide array of choices, including an egg station, salad items, many types of fruit, and a range of gourmet breads. Although the pool was modest, the hotel's gym was among the best of any I have seen, with a good set of weight-training machines, free weights, and cardiovascular equipment. Hotel employees were uniformly gracious and welcoming, and the concierge staff were generous with their time, providing many good suggestions for dining and touring.", "title": "Great hotel in a great location", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "sailornep5", "date": "November 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 11174979, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Internet fees"}}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 59, "average": 168, "very good": 547, "terrible": 41, "excellent": 628}, "aka": "Marriott Sydney Harbour At Circular Quay Hotel Sydney", "slim_ranking": 0.156756756757, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Sydney Harbour Marriott at Circular Quay is the perfect hotel for those wanting a truly Sydney experience.
