Check-in was very easy and we were able to check in to our room at around 2:00. The room was clean, but they were having issues with the air conditioning system that weekend and it was bit too warm. The city was cutting down tree limbs down the street and so we had a rude awakening at 6:00 the first morning. Gill was very helpful in having us moved to another room which was higher up and faced the back courtyard. The air conditioner worked great in this room and there was no street noise. The staff was very helpful and efficient whether it was calling cabs or storing luggage.

Right on the edge of Japantown is a blocky, almost brutalistic Best Western Hotel circa the late 1960s/early 1970s, complete with popcorn ceilings and metal doors. But it seems that someone came up with the brilliant idea to go way left of center with the inevitable renovation. Rather than aspiring to some kind of zen retreat ala the nearby Kabuki Hotel, why not do something cheap but fun? Instead of dark stained ebony, use knotty pine. Instead of images of geishas and crashing waves, why not channel kitschy Harajuku and manga fabulousity? The result is something that is less Akira Kurosawa and more Akira, the animated manga movie.
