Everything about the accomadation was excellent. Bill and Shan the owners were lovely hosts, friendly and helpful, there if you needed them, but without being in your face all the time. The bed was comfortable (not something I say very often) with quailty duvets and pillows. The room was well designed and spacious, also nice and warm, but if you got too warm you could turn the rad off. The breakfast was excellent, with (unusally for a B&B) plenty of choice. Our bathroom had a seperate shower as well as a roll top bath. We had lovely views from our bedroom window, and being up a no through road, was very quite, just what you want for a relaxing weekend away. Being adults only is a real plus in my book, no screaming kids running up and down on the wood floors at all time of the day and night.

Everything was really clean too. We were offered tea and went down to the patio and Shan served us a pot of tea and slices of cake - delicious. It's a wonderful home and you really feel very welcome.

What a gem. Lovely room and located in a lovely thatch roofed village, it really is a cracking location. The breakfast was awesome, absolutely smashing grub, a clotted cream ice cream was all I could manage during the day! I'm a bit of an animal lover and loved talking to the rather old cat, the duck and it's babies in the pond, the horses in the nearby field and of course the monkeys at Monkey World. Most of all I enjoyed talking to Bill. A lot of places I've stayed at, the proprietors plonk down your breakfast and leave you to it and that's fair enough, but Bill is obviously very proud of his home and his county and takes great pleasure in pointing you where to go for your day out as well as showing a sincere interest in where you've come from.
