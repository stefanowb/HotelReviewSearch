Although the shuttle boat was at service every 15 minutes and it took you straight to the skytrain station, it was not that convenient as it should be. Still the surroundings of the hotel was not a place to stroll down in the afternoon. The overall experience in bangkok on the first day was not very welcoming, due to the scandals that pop into you with a friendly smile on their face and the tuk tuks that charge more than a taxi and even say they dont know where your hotel is after sitting and giving a ride and then leaving you in the middle of nowhere in the rain......Maybe the first impressions are the most memorable.

It seems that less is more was the decorators motto! Breakfast was not a big feast but certainly everything was in the best quality, also the top to floor windows in the breakfast area were a great start in the morning. The staff were very friendly and helpful but do not expect them all to understand and speak English! After all the experience was not bad but having stayed in many 5* hotels and resorts, certainly will never again pay a 5* price to a 4* hotel, even if the paying is for a great view to the river.

The Chatrium Suites was a beautiful breeze of fresh air. It was perfect. The hotel is absolutely stunning. The lobby alone is gorgeous. The staff Is very friendly and helpful. They speak English which was also very helpful. Our room was beautiful. And the view of the city took my breath way. We stayed on the 30th floor in the 1 bedroom suite. The room was spotless. It had a huge kitchen and living room and separate bedroom. The bathroom was very large and had a separate tub. The hotel was so comforting to come back to after a day in Bangkok. The restaurant was wonderful, especially the view and live music every night. It was a great way to end the day. There is a Starbucks also right next door which was very convenient.

They have a great breakfast selection and you have the option of sitting outside by the river to enjoy this. The rooms are lovely and spacious (we had a grand suite) as well as clean and comfortable. The facilities are good - gym, large pool, restaurants.
