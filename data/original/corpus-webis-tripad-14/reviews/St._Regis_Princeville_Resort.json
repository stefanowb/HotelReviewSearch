{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 1330, "name": "St. Regis Princeville Resort", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I spent 8 nights at the St Regis Princeville. It was our 4th time on Kauai and 6th time on the Islands. We were celebrating our 15th Wedding Anniversary and we usually stay down in Poipu at the Hyatt but we wanted to do more up on the north shore this time so we figured we would give it a whirl at the St Regis. Very impressive property and top notch service from the staff. No complaints there. We were upgraded unexpectedly to a Jr. Suite with a butler and loved the room and the view. We had just finished staying a week on the Big Island at the Four Seasons Hualalai, which along with the Hyatt, are our two favorite properties to stay at while in Hawaii. Our Travel Agent Nancy Herron with Journeys to Hawaii out of Oregon was incredible to work with considering we are from New Hampshire. She was instrumental in getting us the room upgrade. The negatives for this hotel were we didn't like the pool as much as the one at the Hyatt or the Four Seasons and thus spent very little time there; second: the hotel bar seemed to require people to be a little more dressed up, which is fine if they had other options besides the pool bar. Also, we were told no flip flops allowed there.??? Considering that is pretty much all we wear when in Hawaii.; third: we knew they required guests to use valet at what we thought was $20/day but found it was $30/day (might have increased from when we booked back in November) but to add insult to injury, they taxed us on it!!??? The Four Seasons Hualalai gave us the option to self park and if we valet parked it was $20/day and no tax!; fourth: there are no ice machines so you have to call for ice delivery and of course, unless you wanted to feel like a jerk, you tipped the person who brought it to you, so therefore were really paying for ice; fifth: no self launder services, so you have to pay an outrageous fee to get things laundered (thank God we went to the Four Seasons first where they have laundry machines for guests to use and ICE MACHINES, so we were able to wash our clothes before going to Kauai and the St. Regis). There are also no close laundrymats to go to either. This would have been crazy if we had stayed here the first week of our two week vacation considering weight restrictions from airlines on luggage. We actually ended up having to wash some shorts in the bathroom, hang dry them and purchase a few t-shirts that we didn't need or want, to get us home. Cheaper than paying the St Regis to launder them. Look, I'm all about paying for what I get and rewarding great service. Our stay here was a good one but these negatives really hurt the overall experience. Again, I don't want to take away from the beauty of the property, rooms or staff, all top notch, but.... If we were to do it again, we would probably spend half of the stay on Kauai down at our still favorite resort the Hyatt and then rent a condo or B&B for the time we spend up on the North Shore for the second half of the trip, if you care for my advice. There is so much to do and see on the North Shore but your hotel options are limited to the St. Regis or the Westin. The St Regis is an awesome property for those that like that atmosphere but we get an unbelievable experience at the Four Seasons Hualalai and the Grand Hyatt on Kauai with a balance of elegance, five star resort accomodations with a down to earth atmosphere. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
