We pulled up and immediately, the doorman (who was incredibly friendly and helpful) helped us with our bags to the hotel. When we asked about a nearby parking garage (given the steep $50 overnight valet parking fee), he directed us to a garage literally up the street (Sutter Stockton Garage), which offers overnight parking for $26. So I would recommend dropping off any luggage at the hotel first, and then parking the car at the garage. The front desk was efficient and friendly, and offered us free bottled water upon check out (for our walk to the Giants-Phillies game!) They also let us store our bags there after checkout, which we picked up on returning from the game and picking up our car from the garage.", "title": "Quiet oasis in the City", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "starhawk", "date": "August 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116577915}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We went to a Giants-Phillies game the next day and walked there (about 15-20 minute walk) with easy directions from the doorman (I wish I remembered his name!)

I booked through Expedia and paid about $238 for the room (California Room with King Bed). The room had a comfortable king sized bed, one nightstand, a desk (next to the bed) with chair, an armchair, and combination TV stand (with flatscreen TV) and minibar. The minibar had a nespresso machine with good espresso \"pods\", two bottles of water (I think one is complimentary), snacks (potato chips, nuts, etc.) and minifridge with various juices, sodas, alcoholic beverages, etc. The linens were soft and good quality and the room was pleasantly furnished and decorated, albeit a bit small (but comfortable). The bathroom door was a frosted glass and wood sliding door, the bathroom itself was spacious and tastefully done. The shower had excellent water pressure, and the Molten Brown toiletries were great. There is also a nice \"closet\" wall with shelves, a safe, etc. on the opposite side of the bathroom. The room was very quiet except during the afternoon on the first day, when there was a protest/demonstration going on the next block over.
