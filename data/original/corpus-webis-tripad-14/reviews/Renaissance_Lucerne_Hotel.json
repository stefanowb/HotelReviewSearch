We really like it. Its location is perfect: two blocks to train station and everything else is within a few minutes walk. It\u2019s newly renovated from a hundred year old building on a main, tree-lined shopping street: classy outside and modern inside. The public areas are small as expected, but the room was large: a nice king size bed room facing the street, with a small iron-railed balcony. With window closed, we didn\u2019t notice any noise during sleeping. We did sense the beats from the bar/club below and didn\u2019t feel annoyed. The staff members speak very good English and were very attentive (we needed utensils for the desserts bought from a nearby bakery and they were delivered to our room in less than 5 minutes). The room has a nice wall size see-through window between the room and a surprisingly large bathroom. Unlike the one in Marriott Shanghai Center, however, this window doesn\u2019t have a blind to block the view. For a couple, it\u2019s OK. For a family, it may be a little inconvenient (probably, the window is only in the one bed room for a couple). We didn\u2019t, as usual, have any meal in their restaurant.", "title": "The smallest Renaissance is a charm", "user": "drdw", "date": "October 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143978288}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall, it was a very nice stay and we will certainly stay there again when in Luzern.", "title": "Boutique type hotel at reasonable price", "user": "johnrPerthAustralia", "date": "October 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143886403}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Had 2 nights in Lucerne October 2012.", "title": "Staff, room, breakfast, and a Nespresso coffee maker in the room", "user": "MarketTime", "date": "October 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 143867825}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Centrally located renovated hotel.", "title": "Classy boutique hotel", "user": "RobinS50", "date": "October 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143468594}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Relatively small hotel around 80 rooms from memory.", "title": "Wonderful experience - best Renaissance I've every stayed at!", "user": "oldranger81", "date": "October 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143333178}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled solo", "text": "Front desk was very warm and welcoming upon arrival.

My criteria for a hotel is that the accommodations are clean, fresh (not worn), and modern (decor and tech-wise). This hotel did not disappoint in respect to these points.

Seriously- it took 3 calls to get them to turn down the volume and the bass. And then they told me that I needed to give them some time to take care of it.

We were all tired and hungry wanting to relax have some room service and clean ourselves. When we arrived at night it was raining heavily and we had to take the children in side in a hurry so that they don't get wet. First surprise was that there is no valet service, noone to greet us or help us take the bags out of the car and into the hotel. My poor husband had to park outside the hotel while the receptionist warned him that he has to move the car asap otherwise he will get a ticket... So my husband was rushing in and out trying to unload the car and once that was done he had to find a place to park the car (it took him ages and he got lost a couple of times). The staff never offered to help him. The room was clean, it had a stale smell so I had to keep the windows open, the room service was limited and average.
