Took our daughter who is 2yrs 6 months. The room was clean, functional,safe but basic. Tv had cbeebies and nickjr in English !! Small kitchen is ok to do snacks etc bit nothing more. Staff and reps were great with kids and ours loved every minute. Only problem was everything was geared for 3yrs and above. They did a toddlers club but it was only 3 days a week. Pool was good and lots of play areas etc. Bit of a scramble for sunbeds despite a supposed no reservation policy. Expect to set your alarm for half 7 to get near the pool. We self catered but tried the buffet one night and it was fine. The walk down to the main square is a good half an hour at least but is enjoyable. The best advice we had was to use the hotel towels for the pool for a refundable \u20ac5 each. Overall had a great time and would recommend to friends with young children and would definately return.", "user": "mince963", "date": "July 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 69478500}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We have just come back from a week at the Playa Mar. What a wonderful time we had. Thomson have got it so right with this hotel. If you are after a relaxing holiday in the sun - look no further. Fancy an hour off from the kids - no problem. The kids clubs entertained the kids and allowed my husband and I to top up our tans without having to keep one eye open. With children of 9 and 5, the kids drop in den meant they could go together which was brilliant for us as it gave us the balance of family time and couple time. The walk to the beach was a little too much in the heat for little legs but fantastic when you got there.

Pool area really clean too, usual prob with people reserving sunbeds during the night , but there were still plenty to use even in the afternoon. The poolside bar really good value for money and nice food. Thompson childrens club was great, our 6 year old enjoyed it a lot and the kidszone in the evening. The only thing we found that the time of her club was difficult if you did want to go out of the hotel for the day. The entertainment also finished at 11pm so great to be able to get some sleep and kids to sleep. We were able to watch from our balcony. Did use the restaurant a few times, breakfast selection really good value. The area was lovely, just a couple of minutes to the pine walk along the sea front which although quite a walk had lovely views and little bits of beach.
