Lunch and dinners offered a range of different vegetables (please, God, no more choi), inventive salads, fresh fruit, rice or noodles and at least three different types of meat dishes. The chicken was generally excellent as was the prawn, calamari and beef offerings though strangely the fish was often overcooked and/or dry. To clear the air on beverages: each chalet has a small fridge which you can stock yourself by purchasing drinks at the restaurant. Those on offer during our stay included Coke, Sprite, carbonated rainbow horrors, bizzaro mango and papaya juice-drinks (now with jellied chunks!) Guinness, Tiger, Carlsberg, Heineken, several different red wines and a selection of any white you like as long as it\u2019s Chardonnay.

Happily, both my wife and I are *merely* snorkelers, plus we smuggled in a bottle of duty-free vodka which we combined into cocktails with the aforementioned soft drinks to mixed success.
