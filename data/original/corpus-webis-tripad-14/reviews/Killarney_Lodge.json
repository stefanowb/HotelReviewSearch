Unlike most B&Bs their price is per room not per head, and most rooms can comfortably sleep two couples. There was a nice fire going in the entrance way when we came in and our hostess was there to greet us. All the shops and restaurants in downtown Killarney are a 3 minute walk away. There was so much to do I felt like we didn't have enough time there. It is in a wonderful location to stay if you are exploring the Ring of Kerry and the hostess is more than happy to give recommendations. Killarney National Park is also a wonderful place to explore.
