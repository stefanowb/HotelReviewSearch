The immediate neighborhoud is rather shabby but it's very close to the old city of Quimper. Once you're inside the h\u00f4tel, you'll feel at home with very friendly service. Rooms are newly renovated, the bathrooms are very clean. What makes the difference is the professionnalism of the personnal, you can even plan with them your stay in Quimper and the region. Breakfast (11 euros, not cheap) was excellent with amazing croissants and great ingredients in general for the food (don't hesitate to ask for an omelette; is not on the menu but is available and very good!!!).

The front desk staff was so helpful and welcoming - offering excellent suggestions for local restaurants (not tourist traps) and seeing the town. We felt like we were at a \"home away from home\".
