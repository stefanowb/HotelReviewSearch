The staff were very helpful in advising on everything from the weather forecast to the various options for visiting Auschwitz. We found the room a bit small but comfortable, with a superb bathroom (shower only). The towel drying rack was useful for damp clothes when we came back from a rainy day of touring. The most impressive aspect of the hotel is the restaurant, which in good weather opens onto a lovely small patio. The menu is extensive, the food carefully prepared and served, and the tables spaced to allow for quiet conversation. There is a good wine list at reasonable prices. The breakfast buffet was generous and attractive. Our only small complaint is that the bed has a very soft mattress that provides little support.
