The off season rate didn't seem too bad at $140/night, but that's where the good comments end. We both travel quite a bit and can say without a doubt that this place has the WORST BEDS of any hotel ever! The bed was literally lumpy and practically sitting on the ground. My husband had such bad back pain, that we decided to get up early just to drive home. Also, the \"motel\" styled heater would only blow the same temperature of hot air no matter what setting. It was impossible to get the room at a comfortable temperature. I had to get up 3 times in the middle of the night to shut it off and turn it back on again. It would go from being a sauna to freezing. Then, the railing around our patio area had a loose board that kept banging when the wind would blow which also kept me up half the night. The worst part about this was at checkout when we told the front desk, they had little to say other than sorry. We will NOT go back to this place. I recommend sticking with the local B&B's.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "bzambito", "date": "February 26, 2006", "id": 4521528}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "service very dissappointing", "text": "My work group made reservations months early, requested specific accommodations that were available and so signed the contract with the hotel. We checked 2 weeks prior to arriving to assure we had the requested accommodations and were told we did. One day prior to our arrival, we were called and told that some other group wanted those accommodations so over half of our group was being bumped to less desireable motel style rooms. When it was pointed out to the hotel manager that this was not ever our experience with other hotels, she said that they \"were not like other hotels\". Apparently not. In addition, the manager was rude and offered our group nothing to make up for this unhospital behavior. When asked she flatly refused. The setting on the water is great, the food is not very good (the breakfast buffet on one morning consisted of breads and a kind of cheese whiz omelet, no meat of any kind).

First time to St Michaels, 9 of us staying there. Almost all rooms are in seperate buildings, first floor, like attached apartments. Views and surroundings are AMAZING at this resort, just beautiful. Right on the water, no matter where you walk around this resort. Everything there was decent, rooms just ok (some problems, but staff fixed them) but I stayed in the \"900\" building, where you have your own porch overlooking water 20 feet away, my kids played in the water and the pier in front of our \"porch\" while we relaxed (you can't do this in all buildings). Free buffet breakfast every am, decent, will fill you up, and pool is very nice. Not only will we remember our family reunion, but we will remember this beautiful hotel for years. It's not 5 star service or rooms, maybe a 3 star, but breathtaking surroundings.
