Just a short walk to the Bright Angel Restaurant, which served good breakfasts & dinners -- not cheap, but not overpriced either. Staying right on the rim gives you the opportunity to explore it in the early morning and late evening, when there are no crowds -- very neat. The stone corral, where mule trips into the canyon originate, was just a short walk from our cabin. Was fun to walk down each morning to watch wide-eyed folks saddle up and head over the edge.
