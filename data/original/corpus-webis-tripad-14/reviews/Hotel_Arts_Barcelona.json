Anyway ,room was what we booked, 2 doubles on club floor with a view of the beach and the city. But considering we were in Barcelona for a birthday celebration there were no extras in the room, such as a cake, or some chocolates or a bottle of champagne to add a little special extra touch. But we had booked a romance package which included a butler and breakfast the following morning but unfortunately concierge on club level FORGOT to arrange it for us!!!! O.k then, another oversight!!!! Next, my daughter was told she couldn't take her cookies to the room as all food was to be eaten inside the club lounge. Which was fine and we explained to her that if these were the rules then fair enough, until, less than 5 minutes later another guest simply waltzed out of the lounge holding a glass of wine and a slice of cake,while watched by a member of staff who simply smiled at her. At this point we were beginning to get the feeling that this was not a very child friendly hotel, and different rules applied to different people.And we have stayed at 3 other Ritz hotels, all club level and never experienced anything like this strange attitude to younger guests at all.
