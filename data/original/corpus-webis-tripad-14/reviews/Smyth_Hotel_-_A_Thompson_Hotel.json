This was noted in earlier posts; however, I had contributed this to the fact that the hotel was new and assumed the problem would have been resolved by this time. It has not, and if plan to stay in one of these rooms, be prepared to hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the next room. Further to this, I treated my nephew to a night at the Smythe, and although he did not have an adjoining room, he reported to me that they were blasted out of bed at 2am by their neighbours Reggae music. Front desk calls to the room went unanswered, and hotel staff spent 5 minutes at the doors trying to get this guests attention. The loud music was brought under control by about 2:30am. only to resume at 6:45am. My nephew and girlfriend were not impressed, and the fact they both live in college dorms, you can assume they have a noise tolerance level that would exceed most. In all, it is a very nice hotel in a very nice area, but be warned that noise continues to be an issue in both the adjoining rooms and throughout the hotel. *At checkout, desk staff was apologetic for the situation but made no efforts in compensation of any sort.

The entire staff, especially Mary at reception, was extremely welcoming and friendly throughout my stay. The hotel is beautifully designed. My room was gorgeous and spotless, with an iconic view up West Broadway to the Empire State Building. I loved the Kiehl\u2019s bath products. The location of the Smyth Tribeca is perfect, too: every major subway line converges within a few block of the hotel. The 1-2-3 line is directly in front of the hotel, which makes for effortless travel to and from Penn Station, the West Village, the contemporary art galleries in Chelsea, the Theater District, and Central Park. The 4-5-6 trains three blocks away at City Hall allow for equally easy travel to Grand Central Station and all of the museums on the Upper East Side (Metropolitan, Whitney, etc.).

A big flat screen tv and Ipod docking station. Chic good sized bathroom with large rain shower having floor-to-ceiling translucent glass shower wall towards the room. Separate toilette. Great amenities (Kiehls). Ample wardrobe space. Even though located on busy street had absolute no disturbance. Had issue with the air-condition which was making terrible noise. Unfortunately hotel failed to repair it during our stay although offered to move us to a king suite. The suite very big with separate living room, but they all face the backyard with no nice views so we didn\u2019t move. Think the best rooms are the corner rooms (studio king) having windows facing 2 streets. Unfortunately restaurant was not yet open but sure will be good. Bar was very cool but (probably due to lack of restaurant) not as crowed as we expected. Fitness room was good size and very well equipped. Hotel location might be a little far away from Soho (about 15 minutes walk) but same time only few minutes walk to ground zero. And there are plenty of good restaurants around in the area.
