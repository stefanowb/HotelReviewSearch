NOT WORTH IT AT ALL! We reserved on-line (and confirmed by a return e-mail) a $250/night oceanfront 2-queenbed plus sleeper sofa room. Upon check-in, we were given instead a 1-kingsize plus sleeper room on the first floor with a no-privacy patio that was next to a noisy and crowded kiddie pool, with no-ocean view. The hotel should say on its website that ground-floor oceanfront rooms in the hotel were pool/pool-bar view only. We asked to be moved to a higher- floor for patio-privacy and good view of the ocean, but was unsympathetically denied by the reception desk. Hotel staff was not friendly and helpful, pizza in the atrium tasted like it was stored in the freezer for months, the starback coffee was washed down with water, the arcade had outdated video games, the smell of the indoor pool was unusally strong, the atrium was loud and noisy, and food in the breakfast atrium and Seasons Restaurant was horrible! For the price we paid, we were better off getting a non-ocean front room in some other 3-star hotel!

This was the kind of place where I got a bad feeling right from the start. It looked old , run down and creepy from the outside. The lobby was similar, and very noisy with kids running everywhere. We got to the hotel around 1 pm , and checked in with a women who was quite unfriendy. She said check-in time was 4pm ( in a very snappy way) and made almost no attempt to see if any room was available or to try to make on avialable. I cant ever remember the last time I was not able to check into a hotel after 1pm, especially one this large. But thats ok, I can deal with that. We came back around 4pm to check back in and were told our room was ready. I had paid an extra 30.00 for an ocean view room, and was given a room on the first floor with a view of a concrete wall and a closed down tiki bar. Real nice. Not to mention the fact that to get to our room you have to drag your stuff through the crowded ice rink . Our room was located about 3 feet from where people congregate before getting on the ice.. it could not have been in a worse location. I went back in to the front desk and ecountered the same rude women who told me there was no way to change my room, which was an obvious lie. She just had no desire to do it. The buffet looked horrible, and our friends confirmed that after trying it for breakfast. I really didnt see any redeeming quality about this place.

When I complained to the front desk that no one told us and that we missed our chance to skate because we did other activities Saturday, the manager couldn't have care less. Not even an apology. This may be a great summer vacation, but for a fall stay, they don't care. It is almost like they want you to go home so they can close! If you need to extend check out time, forget it.

What she didn't point out was that the dunes were blocked by an outdoor restaurant and tiki bar, with tables no more than eight feet from our patio door. The umbrella tables were so close to our room, that during a brief storm, the wind knocked one of the tables on its side, hitting our door. Sitting on a chair on our patio, we had people at the closest table no more than three feet away. The other door to the room opened directly into the activity in the atrium. At one point, the theme from \"Space Odyssey\" from the front door and the sounds of a duo performing \"Rollin' Down the River\" from the patio door were a cacophony so loud that we couldn't hear each other talking in our room.
