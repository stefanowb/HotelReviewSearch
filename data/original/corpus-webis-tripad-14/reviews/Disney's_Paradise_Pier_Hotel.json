We have just returned from a 5 night stay. Two adults and 3 children, we had a room (709) with 2 queens and a sofa bed; the room was very recently refurbished from what I could tell, very clean, comfortable, empty mini fridge for your drinks etc. The lobby is not the Grand Californian and the pool is nothing special - however you can use the Grand Californian lobby all you want, charge meals, spa service etc to your room. When we were there the pool was closed so we were able to use the pool at the Grand Californian and the Disneyland Hotel which was a real bonus. If your little ones are tired you can watch the fireworks from the pool deck and they pipe you the sounds/music that you would hear in the park - now that's Disney!

The Grand Californian is the only place to stay if you're going to spend the night at Disneyland. Everything from the pool chairs to the food quality was so much higher at the Grand, and you cant beat the easy access to Downtown Disney and Ca. Adventure.

Having worked in the hotel/hospitality business for many years, including some at Walt Disney World in Florida, I knew what to look for from both a guest and employee point of view. I have to stress that this hotel wasn't originally built as a Disney hotel, and for those who are used to staying at the heavily themed WDW hotels in Florida, you might be a little disapointed in this one. However, we still enjoyed the stay, and both of us thought the cast members at the hotel were very friendly and helpful! You can hear the noise of the theme park rides outside your room at night, but that didn't bother us.
