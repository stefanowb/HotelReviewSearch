The beach is not really a swimming beach. To be fair during our stay it rained 4 out of the 7 days, but people should be aware that the beach is severely impacted by the tides and at low tide best you can do is wade out to the reef. The coral has also been impacted by pollution so the best place to go snorkeling is on the right side of the beach. Due to the water levels you can only do the beach water activities at high tide which can sometimes be at the times you want to get out and about during the day, but on some days it was only at 7am so best to plan your days around the tides. I would always recommend grabbing a pair of the reef shoes for walking on the beach as it is quite painful to walk on in some areas due to the amount of crushed up coral on the beaches.", "title": "Great place to relax and pamper", "user": "Ge0rgieT", "date": "October 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119173198}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Have just come back from a 10 day stay at this beautiful resort, what an amazing place.", "title": "PARADISE", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "woody255068", "date": "October 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118829494}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in a superior room which was kept beautifully clean and was just enough room for the four of us, the view was beautiful looking over the gardens., couldnt fault it in anyway.", "title": "first time in fiji", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "happyfamily14eva", "date": "October 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118829264}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The restaurants were first class, most amazing selections of beautifully fresh foods on different nights.", "title": "Another fantastic holiday at Outrigger !!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hutto1358", "date": "October 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118805999}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011", "text": "As for the staff the most wonderful genuine friendly people i have ever met, they couldnt do enough for you.
