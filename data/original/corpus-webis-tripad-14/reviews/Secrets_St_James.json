We booked thru Expedia and arranged the transportation thru Jamaica Tours (thru expedia)...everything worked out perfect. It was a seamless transport from the airport to the resort (we had a Junior Gulf View Suite). The best thing about the resort is the STAFF, and beautiful turquoise water...everyone is so friendly and nice. The resort is very nice, AMAZING comfortable beds, lots of bars and restaurants to choose from...in regards to the food HIMITSU is the best restaurant there (I will give you a detailed description of each place and must try's below.

Beautiful views from every room. Christopher Brown was there to greet us, showed us our room and was there throughout our stay for anything we had questions about. Even getting my husband back to our room safely after getting lost lol Rodney at the Marlin Bar makes the best drinks and was very attentive to all his customers. Catamaran trip was beautiful...I believe Darren was our guide, and very informative. The French restaurant was among our favorites for dinner and wish we had tried the Seaside Grill for lunch earlier than our last day there. Jamaican Smile, Rum Punch, Mexican Dessert Shot and Big Bamboo were my preferred drinks. Barefoot Grille had a self tap beer for hubby. We did spend the extra for the Preferred Club, but didn't really see that it was worth it. We did get free wi-fi (which I barely used) and a soaking tub (not used at all). Our upgraded mini bar only consisted of 4 Red Stripe and a bottle of Brandy, Rum and Vodka. The lounge had an awesome open bar setup, though it seemed that anyone could frequent it. They never checked who was preferred or not. And the preferred St James was on the opposite side of the restaurants. The Bike tour was a neat little trip, just be sure to bring cash as they take you to a souvenier shop and juice bar. Well worth the money though. Just remember to be patient, they're not always in a hurry to get you things.Overall, great experience!

The property is beautiful and well-cared for. Since you're sharing services with Wild Orchid you basically have 8 restaurants, 5 pools and something like 8 bars at your disposal. We stayed in the preferred club. Well worth it in our opinion, but we're in our early 60's and liked the two private and quiet pools exclusively for our use. One was warm; one cool which was also pretty...cool! We had requested an upper floor (3rd) - I'd highly recommend same if you're doing the St. James Preferred because the views are better. They set up a nice little hot breakfast, lunch and appetizer set-up 18 hours or so a day with an amazing assortment of top shelf liquors.
