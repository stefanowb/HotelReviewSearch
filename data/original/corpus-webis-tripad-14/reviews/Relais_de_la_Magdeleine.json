It has a tranquil setting with swimming pool in a secluded area. The building is an old manor house. The rooms are old fashioned, but have a faded charm, although the bathrooms could benefit from some updating. The kitchen is excellent and dining outside under the floodlit plane trees is a joy. The service is good and the owners of the hotel run the place themselves and have a keen interest in maintaining high standards.

Then drove 5 hours in torrential rains wondering if we'd made a mistake. No mistake. We could not disagree more strongly with the unhappy review. As we stood in the rain looking at the welcoming entrance, we were met by Vincent, the son of the matriarch who runs the hotel. From that moment forward, every wish or request was promptly and happily honored, and our stay was perfect. Our very quiet and private corner room was one of the less expensive rates, yet was roomy and filled with windows, every one with a spectacular view. The furnishings were antiques burnished with the patina that years of age provides, and fabrics were the warm colors of Provencal. Bath was spacious, modern, and well equipped. The hotel public spaces are high ceilinged, with the feel of an English manor house, one room flowing into the other. An inviting fire awaited to banish any chill. Our dinner was creative, delicious, reasonable, and served by candle light in a private and romantic setting with meticulous service and no sign of stuffiness. All the staff were gracious and well trained, and seemed to have been in their roles for a long time. The next morning, in bright sun, we explored the grounds and could fully appreciate how beautiful the setting is. We met Madame, who charmed us, in contrast to the sometimes formal French persona which can be difficult to penetrate. We left feeling as though we'd been privileged to stay in a family home, and can't wait to return.", "title": "Treated like family", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "candj2010", "date": "October 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 82831688}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is the third time we have stayed at this lovely old hotel, which was once a private 18th century mansion and is fronted by a line of ancient plane trees.

We had one room with twin beds - that room seemed much smaller than the other double rooms we had but all had large bathrooms. Weather permitting eating is outside - breakfast, lunch and dinner. Very romantic. Is formal and the meals are not cheap. Set meal or a la carte. But great food. Tables in the evning all have their own candles or table lights and everyone sits under the trees.
