The lobby has a quiet opulence, and upon entering, you immediately notice a pleasant, spicy scent that is apparent throughout the hotel. We wondered if it was fed through the air conditioning system! Reception staff were friendly, though slightly aloof. We had booked a superior room which was beautifully furnished but very small. A large spa bath occupies one end of the room (the bathroom area is not closed off from the rest of the room), and the toilet and shower are separated by frosted glass panels. This is not a place to stay if you are shy around your travelling companion! We were surprised to find one of the sink taps chipped and loose. Staff were helpful with any requests. One useful tip - hotel postcards will be franked for free if you hand them in to reception. The pool area is beautiful and particularly nice for breakfast and snacks. I probably wouldn't stay here again; although I'm glad I had the experience, it really wasn't my style,and for the money I believe I can find more informal accommodation elsewhere on the Gold Coast.", "title": "Nice if you're into that style", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "anahira21", "date": "October 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10033233, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Service", "disliked": "\u2014 Price"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with family", "text": "A very stylish hotel.

I am advised that they are now all re-enforced with steel. This obviously has coloured my experience of the hotel but I must say that proir to that the service was patchy, some good some totaly indifferent. The food was average. It is packed to the gunnels with bling and Versace over the topness. Personally I found it garish and ugly.
