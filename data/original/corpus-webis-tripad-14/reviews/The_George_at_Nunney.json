And I'd like to be able to tell you about the atmosphere. But I can't tell you about either. We visited Nunney today and intended to have a small meal in the The George. On arrival, my husband told the woman behind the bar that we would be ordering food, but her immediate response was to inform us that there would be a very long wait. This inn has a lot of tables but we couldn't see any more than about 15 people or so sitting around. There were far more empty tables than customers. So I asked how long could we realistically expect to wait....she didn't exactly give us a straight answer but instead mumbled about having one x table of 5 people waiting and one x table of 6 people waiting. Okay, I'm no Carol Vorderman but even I can calculate that that's a grand total of 11 people.....which is not very many. When I asked whether even sandwiches would be a long wait, she sniffily replied that they 'don't do sandwiches' and pointed us towards a cafe elsewhere in Nunney.", "title": "A waste of time", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "fernygurny", "date": "November 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"location": 5.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 145091210}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I can see from a previous review that a long wait seems to be par for the course here, so perhaps they need to rethink their kitchen staff.
