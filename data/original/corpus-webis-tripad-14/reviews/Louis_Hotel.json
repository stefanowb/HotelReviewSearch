The room itself was great, spacious and well-designed (apart from the windows / curtains), with a view of the market. However, the curtains are placed about 2 feet from the two windows, and do not cover the whole area, which means that at the first light (around 5:30am onwards in Summer), the room becomes very bright. Because of the light we woke up at 6am and couldn't go back to sleep, which is very unfortunate when you are on holiday. This would be easy and inexpensive to fix, all the hotel has to do is install some blinds. In the morning we asked whether there was another room that was darker, and were told that all rooms have the same design of windows and curtains. We had booked for 5 nights but chose to leave after 1, because we didn't fancy waking up every day at 6am. They had the nerve to charge us for 80% of day 2, which was indeed according to their policy, but did not take account of the fact that their room design made it impossible for us to stay there.", "title": "If you want to wake up from bright light at 6am, this is the hotel for you!", "user": "SegwayStation", "date": "July 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 135575827}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Another issue we encountered was their restaurant level of service (Emiko Japanese restaurant). When we arrived in the evening we went down to the restaurant but there was no table so we decided to order room service. We were hungry already when we ordered. About an hour later the food was nowhere to be seen, and I called the restaurant. The manager said it was in process and it would arrive in 10-15 mins. In about 20 mins I called again, and by that point we were starving. I asked the restaurant manager when he thought we placed our order, and he said \"half an hour ago\". I said he should check the relevant slip, he said he did, and that's what he saw. The food eventually came around 90 mins after we placed our order, without ice cubes and without a dessert menu, as we had asked. We also needed steamed rice, but rather having to wait for god knows how long for it, we just had the food without it. Had a chat by phone with the hotel manager later on who said the restaurant was exceptionally busy that night, and deducted 50% of the meal bill. I'd rather have paid the full amount and have the food come in a reasonable time frame, and as ordered.

If you leave out one door, you are in the market where you can find meat, cheese, wine, etc. If you leave out the other door, you can find more upscale shops and cafes. There are a million options for food, beer, and shopping right at your fingertips. The hotel itself is nice, if not a little on the steep side for price. The rooms were very clean and the sheets on the bed were probably the nicest I have found at any hotel. The bed was also very comfortable. The TV was very small and was not worth much more than background noise. The air was nice, but not American cold. You have to put your key in a slot in the room in order for the lights and air to come on, so you can't plan on having a cool room to come back to at night. The staff was incredibly accommodating. They were very helpful regarding directions, taxis, etc. The bar was also staffed by nice gentlemen. You do receive free WiFi, which is unusual, and an added bonus. It's not a strong signal but worked for the most part. I enjoyed my stay here and would stay again.

The hotel decor is very pleasing and contemporary with a wonderful (included in our rate) breakfast (including a Japanese-based vegan full offering). The rooms were very nice, clean, and contemporary (matching the lobby decor). The staff was very helpful and cheerful at all times. The A/C was a little overmatched by the weather we were having (warm and humid at the time), but we asked for an electric fan and were accommodated as if we were staying at the Ritz Paris.
