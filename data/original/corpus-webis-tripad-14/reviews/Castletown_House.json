Not only were we within 5 minutes walking distance from West Kensington tube stop, we were only 10 minutes from Olympia hall and would have been even closer to Earl's Court. It made everything so simple to organize. There are plenty of small shops in the neighbor hood to take care of any incidental item you might need or want and the Tesco superstore is very close by for everything else. It was a thoughtful touch to have water, milk, fruit, tea and fresh flowers already waiting for us, making an immediate trip to shop unnecessary.

The one bedroom ground floor flat is really perfect for a couple with smaller children, but it worked out just fine for us as a couple with an adult colleague. We didn't mind sharing the bathroom and living room/bedroom, especially as we were out most of the time. It is very quiet and sleeping was heavenly. Plenty of pillows, and large towels for everyone. The flat was clean and has all the modern cons you could want complete with a couple of books to have a read at night if the DVDs or music or telly aren't your thing. I would say a bit of instructions for all of the electronics would be helpful for us with out the aid of a young child to steer you through the remote controls.

Then take the district line to West Kensington tube stop. Once you leave the tube stop turn left. You will see a pharmacy (blue sign) about two blocks away across the street. Turn right here and one block later you turn left and Castletown House is right there on the corner. Richard and Mark were very helpful with advice about London. Shopping in London is amazing. And of course there is so much to do in London it is difficult to make a choice of what to see next. We went for High tea and it was great. Word to the wise do not have anything to eat before going for the high tea. It does not look like much to eat when you see pictures but trust me you will definitely leave full.
