The room was nothing fancy, but since you're not going to be in it much is that really an issue? :-) Tile floors, sensible since you'll track in sand; but the floors were very clean! So was the rest of the room. Spacious bathroom with a roomy shower. Yes, I've slept in better beds but after a day spent swimming and sunning (and drinking sangria from coconuts down the way) the crisp clean sheets felt heavenly as my tired slightly burnt self nestled in for the night. There's a restaurant attached to the hotel (we didn't eat there) as well as a nice patio bar (which we did visit...the chicken wrap is delicious) but you can walk down the road a ways and find numerous things to do.", "title": "Get a great night sleep then roll out of bed on to a fantast\u00efc beach", "user": "aerenii", "date": "June 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 164959027}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013", "text": "The best view.. don't expect luxury rooms but very clean and all you need to relax and enjoy the amazing sea view.", "title": "Amazing location..", "user": "Pasukaru03", "date": "June 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 163000887}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013", "text": "Good food, excellent mojitos and good service..
