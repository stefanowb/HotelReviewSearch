Rooms are comfortable and welcoming, although some modernisation could be contemplated - for example the installation of lights in the ceiling. There was a roomy wardrobe, but it was both in a dark corner of the room, and might have benefitted from enhanced illumination. The glass partition around the shower needed sealing, as it leaked onto the floor when one showered. There was a good supply of extra pillows and blankets, as nights in Granada can be cool even after a hot day, as it is located at 2,200 feet. Hotel Alixares stands in a quiet road, the only disturbances being the emptying of bins in the early hours of the morning (nevertheless Spain's general eco-consciousness and cleansing operations by town councils are to be applauded), and the occasional wake-up calls by tour group leaders at around 6.00am on the doors of their tour members, who are scattered about this large hotel. The room we had possessed the old type of safety deposit box - ie. the key has to be requested from Reception, and there is a daily charge. Although a deposit is normally required too, we were not charged it. The TV options were second to none.
