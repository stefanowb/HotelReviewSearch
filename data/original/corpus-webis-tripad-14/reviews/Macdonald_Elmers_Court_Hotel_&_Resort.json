The grounds are attractive, well maintained, and obviously enjoyed by guests of all ages. The food on offer in the Waterford restaurant was excellent, particularly for a hotel. The restaurant manager and her staff are pleasant without being intrusive and are well informed about their food and wine. We took breakfast in our room each day which was fine once we had discovered the secret of getting our order card reliably into the system; hand it in to reception. My wife received a manicure and massage in the spa finding the staff skilled and helpful. However, the treatment area is rather dismal with no natural light and is not easily accessible for clients with mobility difficulties, being located at the bottom of a substantial flight of stairs. Parking for hotel guests was just about adequate as a large number of spaces are reserved for other users of the site. We could only see two dedicated spaces for \u2018blue badge\u2019 drivers.
