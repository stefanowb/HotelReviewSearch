It's ok. Lots of concrete, not very charming, but the lazy river is sorta fun, and there's a little beach area for kids to play. However...on the first day we didn't realize how fortunate we were to have chairs. Because on the second day, we got there around oh 9am, and there were no chairs left. 9am people! So that's when I and other unlucky guests spend the next 2.5 hours getting promises from the staff that chairs will be coming soon every 15 minutes. A few times they told us to just give up, they had no more. Meanwhile, some other guests are whipping out wads of cash and tipping the pool attendants, and magically lounge chairs are appearing for them. Unbelievable. I waited with other families who had the same problem the day before. Two days these poor people had to wait hours each day for chairs. I was incredibly angry after having to wait over two hours on one day. An absolute joke that you charge as much as you do for this property and you can't count how many guests you'll have and get the appropriate amount of chairs ready, especially knowing it'll be busy on a holiday weekend. Go back and read reviews from past holiday weekends, and you'll see it's the same issue year after year. And the same went for the inner tubes for the lazy river. Gone and hoarded by other guests for most of the day. Which created another lovely situation where all guests had to behave like vultures for chairs that might be vacated, or inner tubes being held on to by selfish guests. More than a few times harsh words were exchanged when some guests tried to \"steal\" chairs because guests had gone off to eat, or were in the pool not protecting their chairs.

We drove down from LA and didn't want to go far because of my condition (37wks). We stayed on a friday and left on a Sunday. We were greeting very nicely by the luggage guy and being that I was VERY pregnant the front desk clerk was VERY accommodating and we stayed in bldg 28 on the first floor in room 2814 which was a king bed w/sleeper sofa. Our kids didn't seem to mind the bed at all (2 girls) and my husband and I were in heaven in the king bed. The room was like 10 steps away from the pool and splashtopia. We booked the splashtopia package on the hotel website which is really a good deal because we had our own lazy river tubes to take home. Its a really good family place to get away for the week or weekend being that it also has a little beach area for babies and toddlers. Our girls stayed in the pool area the whole stay which was fine with us. We didn't buy any food from any of the onsite restaurants but instead brought a cooler and ate snacks in our room. The first night we caught a movie down the street at the plaza and the next night which was our anniversary we had the girls stay in the room (both preteens) and they ordered pizza and also went to the pool to see the movie near the pool for the kids, which was an added bonus. There are not many resorts that do this. Kids got to swim and watch a movie on a screen TV all at the same time - hubby and I went to the Cheesecake Factory in the plaza across the street. Our little sitting area outside our room was perfect! It was shaded and looked out over the golf course and the lake. We ate breakfast at Ruby's which was a 50's themed diner about 2 min away across from Apple Bee's in the plaza. Its a nice hotel the only complaint I have is the puddy near the bottom of the bathroom door even though the bathroom was very clean and nice, other than that, we will return with the new addition to our family next summer.", "title": "Nice stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "OliveK", "date": "July 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17769971, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean accomodations", "disliked": "\u2014 Crowded pool areas"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We just got back from a trip for the Fourth of July and it was the best!!!!!! Here is my take on this resort. If you have kids under 12-- it's a must! Splashtopia is fun but CRAZY! Be prepared, bring ear plugs and a good book, Fridays and Saturdays are busy but the rest of the weeks it's quiet. Saturday nights they put up a big screen around the pool and make it movie and swim night-- the kids love swiming at night!!! Make a spa appointment they have awesome deals and the spa and tranquil pool are soothing and regenerating! Food is expensive at the resort: $6 breakfast burrito, $7 beers, $8 hot dog, $11 Nachos, while we did buy there it wasn't cheap BUT don't worry because across the street is a spectacular out door mall surrounded by built in streams and waterfall/ponds and they have great dining!!! Baja Fresh, Cheesecakes, PF Changs, Pieros, Yardhouse, Flemmings Steak-- Our favorite to do was hit happy hour at the Yarhouse they appetizers were amazing especially their take on the California Roll!!!! Go between 5-6PM and order appetizers half price! We also loved Pieros Agua-- it was so delicious! Another quicky place that appeased my 4 year old was Marios Italian Cafe which is at the end of Bob Hope next to the resort. They serve authentic italian and the best cheese pizza--we went there 4 times during our 7 day stay. Don't miss out on the Palm Springs Aerial Tram. It's about 40 degrees cooler at the top and the view is incredible. Its fun going up and down as the floor rotates 360 degrees. We saw fireworks from our hotel balcony and hit up the outdoor market fest in down town Palm Springs on thursday night at 7pm. Knotts Soak City is great if you have teens too. All and all we will definitely be back! We will make sure we stay at the same resort and in our same room!

We spent every day, with the exception of the day we visited \"Soak City\" in Palm Springs, at Splashtopia and enjoyed each and every day. In terms of the water slides, as other reviewers mentioned, the lifeguards do enforce the 48\" height requirement. My five year-old wasn't tall enough to go down the slides, but had a great time in the pool and the other water options. Food and drinks are available poolside. Both are pricey...typical prices for any resort food and beverage. My husband and I enjoyed several delicious cocktails poolside, but found the food to be adequate at best.
