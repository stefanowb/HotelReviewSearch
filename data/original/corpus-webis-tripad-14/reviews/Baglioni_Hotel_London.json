While we were checking in, the front desk attendant paused to take and handle 3 telephone calls. We had been travelling for several hours and were tired and wanted to get up to our room to wash up, but apparently handling others' issues even though we were standing right there was more important. Then, when we got to the rooms, it was one problem after another. First, the telephone didn't work. When the maintenance man arrived, he acted like the problem was mostly ours. He summarily tweaked the battery and left. 5 minutes later, we had to call him back. This time, he replaced the phone and left. 10 minutes later, we had to call him back AGAIN and he had to replace the phone a third time. Finally, it worked. In the meantime, I had to kneel next to the bed with my laptop on the bed and take a work call holding the corded phone next to the bed. With the phone situation finally resolved, I sat down at the desk to do my work and...NO POWER in the outlets at the desk. This took another two calls to maintenance to resolve and, in the meantime, they brought three of the wrong type of adapters for US devices. Finally that was resolved and I sat down hoping to actually get some work done when NO INTERNET access in the room--the signal to that room was so weak that the connection only stayed actived for a few minutes at a time at which point it would drop and take minutes to reconnect. Mind you, we were not staying in the cheapest rooms in the hotel--we were staying in Deluxe Suites. On the positive side, the waitstaff in the restaurant were extremely nice and the food was good. In addition, the lobby staff were also extremely nice and helpful. Finally, the manager of the hotel, Francesco, who was originally fairly dismissive and aloof, eventually seemed sincere in his apologies for all of the problems with the room and volunteered to reduce the room rate by 100 pounds. I am happy to pay 600 pounds a night for a hotel suite and I do not expect to be waited on hand-and-foot. But, I do expect things like telephones, power plugs and wireless internet to work. i do not think I would ever return to this hotel.", "title": "Good location", "user": "Breakingoutnow", "date": "March 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 102144344}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "On the website and at the first glimpse a very attractive hotel - especially in combination with the great location at the the Hyde Park Gate.

Several requests we made to the front desk were immediately attended to, or we received communications from the management in a very timely fashion. The restaurant is a real treat with excellent Italian cuisine and the breakfasts for guests included excellent coffee, pastries, and almost anything one might request. The Spa, while small, provides superb sevices. The exercise room was basic and the treadmill was out of service, but we were able to make do just fine. When choosing our hotel, our major considerations were excellent service and an spacious suite where the three of us could spend time together when we were not otherwise busy. The online information provides the floorplan and dimensions of the suite, and it was by far the most spacious for comparable or better prices than the Mandarin Oriental or similar choices.
