I had been hesitant to book because I'd read other reviews about the dated decor.. and they were right. The lobby and entrance are grand and stately, just as it must have been when it was built. However, our room did not stand up to the Fairmont reputation. I was shocked when we entered our tiny little room that looked like an old pension I slept in when I was backpacking in Europe years ago. The carpet was stained, the wallpaper faded and plain, and a bathroom so dingy I couldn't take my shoes off. The bathtub was an old almond color with matching old beige tiles, most of which had thick black mildew-stained grout from years of water exposure. Even the most weary traveller wouldn't take a bath. The edges were re-caulked with the skill of a 2 year old. The fixtures had seen their day and the overall appearance was the farthest thing from luxury I'd ever seen. The doors are paper thin, you could hear a pin drop in the hallway. The walls aren't much better, as I was woken up every morning by the next room's telephone and ensuing conversation. I also thought it was odd that there was a sheet and a duvet on the bed, but there was no duvet cover. The mattress and bed were very comfortable, which was the best thing about the room. The hotel considers the business traveler by offering in-room internet for $14 per 24 hours, most other hotels don't charge. I would say the housekeeping is good and the hotel is clean. My advise is to save your money and stay at the Hyatt wich isn't more than a block away.

Arrived around half ten in the morning and was instantly greeted by the doorman who took my luggage and directed me to the car rental depot in order that I could return our car. Returned back after half an hour and checked in with no difficulty, a room was made available straight away. I had booked through the Fairmont President Club scheme and received an excellent rate of $154 for the night (including two breakfasts which alone would come to $52!). Made my way up to my room which was excellent, two double beds, desk, flat screen tv etc. Nice touch was the fact that internet access was free as a FPC member, $14 otherwise. Room was nicely decorated and clean throughout. Only downside was that there wasn't much of a view, however in fairness there isn't much a hotel can do about surrounding buildings! Luggage arrived promptly to the room and bell staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel as I had Flames tickets, however we had an excellent early meal at the Keg located in the Westin hotel a few blocks walk away. The following morning we had an superb buffet breakfast, service was fine and the food delicious. Regular buffet price is $26 which I personally feel is worth the money considering the selection and choice of food on offer. The decor was fine throughout, certainly didn't seem to be in need of a refurb as some people have suggested. Having stayed at other Fairmonts it seems of comparable standard.
