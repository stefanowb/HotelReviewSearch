Forget the corporate hotels in Providencia or Las Condes- if you're looking for character and a great location, this is your place. It's right in the heart of Bella Vista, so if you want to hit the bars then you're well located. It's in a historic old building, but completely renovated with modern furnishings. The furnishings themselves are showing a little wear and tear (and appear to be IKEA quality in the first place) but visually the place is great. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The shower was one of the highlights of my stay- the shower head is one of those where it kind of rains on your head. (one peculiar detail was the soap and shampoo that looked like they were purchased by my stodgy old aunt at a cracker barrel gift shop- completely out of place with the modern look of the hotel). My windows looked out onto Pio Nono, which I suppose could have been noisy if you're trying to slumber peacefully- but if you're out at the bars with the other noise-makers and come back late-ish, you shouldn't have a problem. The continental breakfast was really nothing to write home about, but the breakfast area is peaceful and well-designed. There's even a rooftop terrace with a view out over Patio Bellavista, a new plaza with restaurants and cafes. If you want a sound-proof room for a good night's sleep, perhaps you should keep looking.
