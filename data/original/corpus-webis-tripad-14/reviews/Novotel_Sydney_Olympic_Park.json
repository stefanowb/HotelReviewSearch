Having been here during the Olympics as a volunteer, we thought we would give it a go. To our relief we found the hotel and most of all the staff utterly wonderful. The park has developed greatly over the years with lots of food offerings available, always something happening in the Park (we went to the baby expo with our daughter). Transport has improved, and the whole park looks like a veritable entertainment area. Much to my husband's pleasure we went to DFO after the baby expo, while he stayed in the hotel to have a beer and read the newspaper in the bar area overlooking Telstra Olympic Stadium. The hotel was clean, fresh and happy, though it should start looking at updating its furniture (though most hotels need to come to think of it). A gold star to all the staff who were most obliging, friendly, had time to spend wth you even when there was lots to do and did not mind having a chat with an old bird!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Milanista37", "date": "June 30, 2007", "id": 8031563}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "These Olympic Voluteers will be back with pleasure!", "title": "Disaster", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lycook", "date": "June 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 7749810, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 having not to deal with public transportation after the match", "disliked": "\u2014 the hotel"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled on business", "text": "The Coastal Clan", "title": "Please go somewhere else", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SydneyMojo", "date": "May 13, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 7597623, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 The rude and incompetent service from staff"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Probably the worst hotel we ever stayed.
