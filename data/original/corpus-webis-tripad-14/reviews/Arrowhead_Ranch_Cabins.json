They are rustic (built around 1910 but upgraded/updated since then) but very comfortable. The setting is magnificent. You can sit on the porch in the evening and look out over vast meadows and fields to the Wallowa mountains. Jeff and Susan do everything to make sure you are comfortable and are a great source of what-to-do info for the Wallowa area. At $90 per night, this is a great bargain!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jbullock47", "date": "July 29, 2006", "id": 5525907}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Enterprise"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667}
