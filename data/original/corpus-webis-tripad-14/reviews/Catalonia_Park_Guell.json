The hotel was actually further up north in an area called Vallcarca. There was luckily a metro stop that could get me into the city, but it's about a 10 minute walk (up and down hill) to the metro station and not a convenient mode of transport on weeknights after the metro would shut down between 11pm-midnight (make sure to check the schedule!) The staff at the hotel, especially one dark - haired/brunette lady, was not friendly and not very helpful when I asked her about tours, or even things in the area. (She just guessed or assumed and gave me the wrong time that a tour office would close and I missed booking the tour.) When I asked a man at the front desk to show me on the map which way to walk to something, I verified the direction with him twice, but he had sent me the wrong way. Also, I was given a room where the toilet was not working and when I addressed the issue I was told it would be taken care of. Then I left the room for a few hours and came back at about 10pm, only to find that the toilet was STILL not working. I told the hotel staff about it again and a young man from the front desk walked up to my room with me and took a look at it, but then I was told I would have to wait until morning to have the toilet fixed. When I complained and asked for another room, I was informed that there were none available - and the guy said this without even knowing or checking at the desk. Then I raised a ruckus and FINALLY got a room (but it was smaller) with a working toilet. The bathroom was old and cracks were apparent here and there. Then - to add to the fun (NOT!) - on 2 days in a row I found bugs crawling out of the bathroom drain into the tub. YUCK! Another problem was that in the new room the phone was not working and I complained about it 4 times until someone FINALLY came to take a look at it. On the fourth time I marched down to the front desk and told the dark haired lady about it, only to be answered with, \"...if you really need to use the phone then you can see we have a phone booth over there,\" and proceeded to point towards a wall opposite the desk. I told her that was not the point. The point was that I paid for a room with basic amenities included - and that would mean a working phone as well. She didn't say anything back to me at that point, but just went back to whatever she was doing. As a final blow, she couldn't check me out of the room correctly. It was a pre-booked room and she kept insisting she needed the credit card I booked it with. The problem was that I did not have that credit card as it was booked for me by a relative. After about 10 minutes of struggling with her on the issue, I decided to call the relative whose credit card it was and have him read the credit card information to me over the phone and hoped that the lady at the front desk would be able to type it in directly. She said no at first, but then I just asked a man who was at the desk behind her and he said it shouldn't be a problem. So that was that and as the final icing on the cake, that brunette woman had done one thing right (called a taxi to take me to the airport), BUT because of her issues on checking me out the taxi started charging me so I ended up paying 15 Euros more than I should have to get to the airport by taxi. Barcelona was nice, but this hotel just totally ruined the experience for me.

The hotel is in an area of Barcelona called Vallcarca. The hotel is walking distance to great restaurants, supermarkets, shops, cafe's ect. The hotel is also walking distance to Parc Guell which is very beautiful and a must see. I enjoyed staying at this hotel as the area of the city was very pretty and full of culture. The metro is a short walking distance (3 minutes) from the hotel which will take you anywhere you want to go in Barcelona. I would take a taxi at night back to the hotel which only cost me about 10-12 euros from the Olympic Port area. Is the hotel rooms small? yes the room is small, but you really only go there to lay your head down at night so for me it didnt matter and I was quite comfortable. The room was always clean and for me it was great and the price was right with my budget. The bed was not as good as home but I never had a problem sleeping in everyday. If you are a super light sleeper and a very cranky person who gets bothered by other people and noise, I would stay somewhere that has soundproof walls since the hotel can be a bit noisey at times but it did not bother me nor did I let that ruin the wonderful experience of staying in Barcelona and Vallcarca.
