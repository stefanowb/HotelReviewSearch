When driving up to the house (be careful to follow the directions she e-mails you, it can be a little hard to find), you immediately get a view on the Dingle Bay from her driveway. She gave us a lovely tour of the house and our rooms and was very helpful about things to do in Dingle and recommending places to eat. She was a kind hostess, probably cleaned the whole place from top to bottom every day and prepared the most elaborate breakfast I've probably seen in my life. The view from the rooms is amazing (I'll attach a picture later) and the Dingle town is a great place to stay in general. Even the other guests at her place were great, we had a beer in a local pub with one of her regulars!
