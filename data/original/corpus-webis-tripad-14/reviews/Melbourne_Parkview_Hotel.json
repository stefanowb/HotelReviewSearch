I forgot to pack socks for my hubby and when I had a look at their 'motel shopping' list, low and behold you could purchase socks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! when I told my hubby he thought I was joking but no went to reception and purchased some bond socks for only $8. there were other things on the list that would be very handy if you have forgotten something. all the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. the tram stop is a very short stroll away so it was very easy going into the cbd and st.

We arrived early around a 11 am after an early flight from Sydney. Naturally our rooms were not ready at that time, said we would go for a coffee and left our number with reception. They contacted us as soon as one room was ready, which wasn't too long after our arrival. Everything was great in the hotel from reception to check out. The reception staff were extremely helpful. Great view of the Melbourne skyline from our rooms on the fifth floor. No noise from traffic or nearby trams, double glazing. We love fresh air so we opened the window, a big plus for us, which did allow a little noise, but not enough to keep us awake. Breakfast buffet was fine, they did run low on Sunday morning but it was quickly replenished. Not much in the way of restaurants within walking distance, there are a couple of cafes opposite which were fine for light meals.", "title": "Would stay again", "user": "chermick", "date": "December 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 186594870}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Trams are outside and it is only a short ride into the CBD or St. Kilda.", "title": "Very Friendly / Helpful Staff, credit to the facility", "user": "Ian T", "date": "December 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186578899}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Very enjoyable stay, wonderful helpful staff, situated only a brief tram ride from the city after purchasing the MIKI card from reception.", "title": "Would stay again.......", "user": "Margaret M", "date": "December 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186474720}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Everything was clean, crisp and like new, working in the Facilities Management Industry I tend to take much more notice of the smaller things than most people and must say I was very impressed.", "title": "Short but enjoyable", "user": "Tim W", "date": "December 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186448552}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very tight parking is the only let down, but in saying that I do drive one of the largest 4wds available in this country and did manage to get into the car park and into a space ( after removing all luggage before parking)", "title": "CAR PARKING", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Bob F", "date": "November 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186379885}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a great location mid way between the city centre and St Kilda beaches.
