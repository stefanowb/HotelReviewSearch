It\u2019s close enough to the freeway, but not so close you hear the traffic. We got to the hotel at 11:30pm and for security reasons the entrance to the hotel was locked and they have a number posted to call to have the night staff to come let you in. I understand the logic behind this but they are relying in people having a cell phone. Luckily we had one but when we called the number it just rang and rang. Thankfully the clerk was coming from down the hall and saw us at the door. He said his phone never rang. I think there needs to be a better way at getting into the building late at night. We could have been standing there for a long time if he hadn\u2019t seen us. Not what we wanted after a 12 hour drive and at 11:30pm.
