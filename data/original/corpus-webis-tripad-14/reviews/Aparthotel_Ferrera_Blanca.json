All inclusive great for kids soft drinks and ice cream, help yourself or staff always on hand to assist. Can't fault the food, loved the fresh seafood. Always plenty of choice in restaurant and staff there pleasant and happy to help. But the best thing about this holiday for us was the entertainment team, our 5 year old daughter would have stayed with them if she could! Maria and her team were just brilliant. Maria, Ani, Florin, Alex, Radu just made it a perfect holiday for our children. They were on hand day and night to entertain the children. They were also happy for us to come along to the clubs with our 2 year old daughter. Mini disco was great, our kids loved dressing as clowns and dancing on stage!Coco the Sea-horse mascot was a hit from day one! Some very good professional shows after and equally entertaining shows from the entertainment team Always 100% effort. Lovely friendly bar staff, always happy to help.
