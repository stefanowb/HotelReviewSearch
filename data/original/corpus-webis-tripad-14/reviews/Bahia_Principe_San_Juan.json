The staff was extremely friendly and the service was excellent. The only problem that my boyfriend and i encounterd with was a german lady stole our towel. I was laying beside the pool and I had my towel under my head tanning, when all of a sudden this german lady came up to me (who didn't speak one word of english) snached it from underneath me and started cursing at me.. ( at least it sounded like it) So me being 19 and her around her 30s she towerd over me. So i went to the front desk, explained the situtation with the crazy german lady and they were happy to give me a new towel. But it gets better, after that she goes up to the front desk and tries to take that towel away from me!! according to the staff memeber she said that I didn't deserve a towel? haha at that point i was laughing and just walked away. Anyways overall the hotel had an amazing club, kareoke bar, and great shops. Oh ya by the way if you enjoy horseback riding they offered it there along the beach for 8 dollars us!! Amazing prices! well anways im telling you now, that you have to check out this place---but im warning you now-------watch out for the towel snachin lady!! haha", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 19, 2005", "id": 3376492}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "We have just returned from our first visit to the Dominican Republic staying at The Bahia Principe in San Juan for 2 weeks.

Our tour company rated the hotel as 4*+ (based on the facilities provided in the hotel apparently and not the quality of them), but 2 other British companies rated it as 5* with prices to match.

This means that you can have quite a walk to get from some of the rooms to the central pool area where everything goes on and where the main restaurants are located. Also it is about an hour and a half from the Airport and more importantly the Playa Dorada area where most of the hotels on the north of the island are located. This would not be so much of a problem except that most of the trips run by the tour operators start and finish in the Playa Dorada in Porta Plata, meaning that before and after the trip you have a long trip back to the hotel along very bumpy roads. This means that sometimes you have to be catching a bus at 06:30 to take you to start your day trip. Also we knew of a few people who's trip was either cancelled as there were not enough people going from the hotel to justify a bus to get to Playa Dorada or their stay at Sea World was shortened by a few hours because of the length of the journey. (Not the hotels fault but something to bear in mind.)

The first room was on the ground floor and this may have contributed to the problem with the ants because they would not go away even though the staff sprayed the room on atleast one occasion.

Our \"My Travel\" rep told us that they are going to be resurfacing the main pool and surrounding area and also improving the childrens club area.
