The breakfast the was very good with a wide selection.

The staff at this hotel are lovely but although I never believed in hauntings before my stay here-I do now! Try to stay in the new part of the property since when I stayed in the De la pore suite-it was haunted for sure!!!! At first I could not get a good picture of the suite because of all the orbs in the pictures- but I did not know what they were till I got home. We were awoke several times by a ringing phone when I called the front desk to complain --they said it was not possible that our phone rang three separate times from 11-4am without them patching it through? They assured me that they had not transferred a call but that-\"maybe I should disconnect the phone so I would not be awoken anymore.\" I then noticed that the clock radio was disconnected and we heard voices of children running and talking. They said no one was in the rooms around us but it was weird that we heard breathing in our room around 4am and my husband woke me and wanted to leave immediately. He is a fireman 6\"2 and 250 lbs who runs into burning buildings for a living but he wanted to get the hell out of there and forego the prepaid breakfast! He told me of hearing voices and how the tv had changed channels several times earlier.

This was definately the best part of our vacation. The castle is beautiful. The Staff was friendly and very helpful especially Ciara, who helped make our vacation memoriable with her help. Our room was huge, actually 2 rooms, and was decorated with beautiful furnishings. We enjoyed our walks and were able to see the castle, not just our room. The food was great. The staff in the bar even put the NFL game on TV so we were able to watch a game going on Sunday afternoon in the US. Of the 5 places that we stayed at while in Ireland the Kinnitty Castle was the best! I only wish we stayed there longer. If you are going to Ireland this is the place to stay at least 1 night, we stayed 2. It is definately a castle, very clean, great food, and the staff went way above what we expected.

We went for drinks in the dungeon bar after dinner where there was a friendly barman. Only downside was that our room (Inchquinn) was the first on the hall and as there was a wedding in the hotel the day after we stayed, there were a lot of guests going up and down the hall in the early hours, which were very noisy.

We were looking forward to checking into a luxurious suite and relaxing for the evening. We were met by friendly receptionist who told us the usual information and then brought us to our room. What a disappointment. We got the Slieve Bloom room. To say it was basic is an understatment. We have stayed in plenty of castles in the past and indeed got maried in one and are well aware that its an old castle not modern resort, but this was by far the most underwhelming of them all. Maybe we just got the worst room. We did ask for another but were told there was nothing available. The bed was tiny, the room was roasting to the point of being really uncomfortable, the tv was basic and the bathroom was very plain. There wasnt even some water in the room which I would consider common practice for a 4 star. My husband went down to the nearest village to get some. We went to the bar after dinner which was full to the brim so no seats or nowhere to stand really. Its a pity they didnt open the Dungeon bar to allow for it. Anyway on the good. The meal we had was absolutely spot on. We really enjoyed every bit of it. Really nice pate, crab, lamb and chicken and plenty of veg with it. The cheese plate for dessert was massive!

I was traveling with my brother, and as we drove up to the castle our first night, he said \"we're not leaving here alive.\" The management tries to keep the castle as authentic as possible, so while there are lights and running water, you won't find many other conveniences (no internet, elevators, etc). Our first night there we explored the castle a bit and found a room with nothing identifying it. My brother looked through the keyhole and said he saw a faint glow in the fireplace, as if embers remained from a dying fire, but when I leaned down to look myself, the door moved as though someone has pushed against it from the other side and I couldn't see anything. The receptionist said no one was using that room, but told us stories of the ghost who reportedly lives there. We had a great time there and loved the ghost stories that added to the medieval feeling of the castle.

The building itself has lots of creaks and groans and some poorly fitting windows but these are more than compensated for by the fantastic and homely staff, for whom nothing is too much trouble.
