We have a very nice view of the pipes and air-conditioning units on top of the roof, as well as the smoke coming out from the restaurant, and if you stood on your tippy-toes, you could see the ocean... and of course, when we complained about the room, we were told that no other rooms were available, and if we wanted to go to a different hotel, we would still have to pay for the night.", "title": "Beware of the so-called ocean front rooms", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "PeckCheck", "date": "September 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3898149}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "After much discussion with the general manager, we eventually got a room the next night right on the beach which was wonderful, and definitely what I expected the first time around.", "title": "Wonderful experience!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "VejerLinda", "date": "August 1, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3727348}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "On the plus side, the rooms are quite nice and all newly renovated.

Had a non-ocean view room (as OV was sold out), but still had a private terrace with seating and a flowerbox. No direct view, as room was slightly below the pool's ground level. This was as expected though, so not a problem. Room was very comfortable - fabulous bed, whirlpool tub, flat LCD TV, books/DVDs available in room. Staff were universally polite and cheerful. Hotel lobby is a nice place for having winter drinks by one of the fireplaces. The One Spa is small, but treatment areas are well equipped. (Facial from Dijana was great - no lingering red marks on my very sensitive skin!) Food is expensive (but good) here and also at the Casa Del Mar next door, where Shutters guests also have signing privileges. Even though I spend my work life in hotels, this had a wonderful \"private cottage\" feel. (Shutters is more cottage-like in style, where Casa Del Mar is more formal Villa-style.)
