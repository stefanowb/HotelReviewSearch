I cannot think of a negative thing to say about this motel, all is positive. The location is ideal, looking out over Perkins Cove and the ocean is serenity at it's best. Where else can you walk out of your room, across the footbridge to Perkins cove, where you will find, quaint shops, restaurants, boat rides, including sail boats and the entrance to Marginal Way. Cleanliness is excellent as other reviewers have stated. Sitting on the balcony in the morning I observed the staff, cleaning the chairs and actually wet mopping the balcony floor every day. I have never seen that done anywhere else I have stayed and I travel frequently. We met two sisters that were staying, they told us when they got there early they had to wait for their room to be cleaned, the staff took two hours to clean the room. That alone tells you how clean it is kept. The grounds and landscaping are also maintained in excellent condition. We were in a balcony room with two queen beds. This room was excellent, as also stated before, you walk from your car, right into the room, I loved the convenience of that. The motel was full when we were there and we found it to be extremely quiet. The continental breakfast was more than enough, orange juice, coffee, tea, milk, cereal, apples, bananas, muffins and doughnuts from Congdon's doughnuts, best dougnuts I have had in years. All the staff were more than friendly, always a hello, good morning, how are you etc. We had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Nancy and Geoff and were very impressed with how we would observe them working right along with the staff. The pride they have in their motel is more than evident. My granddaughter had never been to Maine before, I asked her if she would like to visit again, her response was, \"only if we can stay here again\" I think that says it all about what a great place The Riverside is.", "title": "Location,Cleanliness,Friendliness", "user": "Ginny1148", "date": "July 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 165834989}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Wonderful location that overlooks Perkins Cove.

This place was not fancy at all, but the location and quality of the rooms more than makes up for that. We stayed in a balcony room overlooking Perkins Cove. The room was the perfect size for two people, and included free wifi (Get off the wifi and get outside, you're in Maine!!!) and a fridge. The grounds were perfectly manicured, and everything had a clean, well maintained feeling. The best part was being a very short distance from everything in Perkins Cove. The only downsides I could possibly come up with is that the balcony's aren't very private, you share a common balcony, separated by plastic chains. Also, the lobster boats in Perkins Cove leave very early in the morning, and the first morning we were there one of the fishermen decided to blast a George Thorogood song at about 5:30am. Kind of annoying, but the sunrise we got to witness because of our early wake up call was worth the annoyance.

When I opened the door to our balcony room, I was blinded by they beautiful gleaming hard wood floors. The room was immaculate. The first thing I always check is the bathroom. You can tell a great hotel versus a bad hotel with one look, and this was a great hotel. The tile shined, the tub and sink spotless without a hint of mildew. Not an easy task when you are located at the ocean. I could tell this was going to be a great stay by how meticulous everything was inside and out. The view from the balcony was breath taking. The cove right in front of us and the ocean waves breaking across the way. The beds were exceptionally comfortable and at night you could hear a pin drop and we had people on either side of us. The continental breakfast was a big plus for us since I do not function without that first cup of coffee. It is located in where the office is and is a bright, warm and inviting atmosphere. There are tables, sofas, and a fireplace. Plenty of books and games for a rainy day or just to relax. I truly could go on and on about all the great things Riverside has to offer, but it would be a novel when I was done.
