Checked in effortlessly and then helped with bags to our room. Room was very clean and spacious for the two of us. Great view we could see both the pool and the ocean. The pool at night is amazing with the blue lights. Daily the room was cleaned and there was everything you needed including washing machine and dryer right outside your rooms. Very close to breakas for meals and snorkling. also lagoon is only a few km down the road where you catch the boat over to erakor island to eat or swim and snorkle over the reef. btw the cost to go over is 2000v but comes off the price of food or drinks.Elizabeth and the other ladies behind the reception counter were lovely and helpful. Both Daniel the security guard and Chanel were also very nice. Make sure you ask Daniel to try their jamblang fruit fresh off the tree. Overall an amazing first time experience in vanuatu and wonderful place to stay. Very highly regarded when you said where you were staying.

The staff are fantastic, the rooms were wonderful - we had 3 apartments in total between 7 of us and we felt truly spoilt. Would recommend Nasama to everyone be it a romantic or a family holiday it works for all.. And did I mention the wonderful staff. Close to Port Vila, simply hop on the local bus's for around $1.50 a trip, it's a wonderful part of travelling in Vanuatu where you can meet the friendliest, and happiest bunch of locals around. Make sure you get to the Beach Bar on Friday evenings to see jaw dropping fire dancers along with dancing on the beach to the local DJ.. That really capped off our special holiday in Vanuatu. If u need your coffee fix head for the French Patisserie opposite the fresh produce market - their coffee is some of the best I have had anywhere around the world. Nasama gets 10 stars if we could go that high.

The reception team of Ashley and Elizabeth do a good job. You are close to supermarkets and the fruit market at Port Vila to cater for yourself, cook in the kitchen or use the bbq facilities,there are also a variety of restaurants all local for dining out. The islanders are wonderful people and all are happy and friendly, always smiley and courteous. We hired a car for a week from world car rentals- see Stalin or Shelley, again so lovely to deal with.

The cooking facilities in the rooms (cooktop, microwave, toaster and kettle) and in the resort (BBQ) allow for good self catering if you wish, with supermarkets and local shops close by and a limited range of essentials at the reception shop. The starter pack of cooking oil, salt and pepper is a good idea and saves buying these when you only need small amounts. Alternatively, there are lots of restaurants in resorts close by if you want to avoid a ride into Vila. Nasama is on the smaller side and has large grounds with a number of different places to hang out; pool, kids pool, BBQ area, beach, or your balcony or patio all of which have great outlooks to the ocean which is just a few steps away from your room.
