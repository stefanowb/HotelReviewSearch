I got eight hours sleep for the first time in a week! Mini refrigerator and valuables safe inside console. Spa robe a nice touch. Cable tv with lots of channels. I didn't use the interconnect connection, but the cable was next to the desk for convenient use (I've been at hotels where it was on the nightstand and had to juggle the laptop on my lap or the bed). Used the fitness club; spacious with four treadmills, several other cardio (cycles, eliptical), full weight sets, several adjustable weight equipment, etc. Clean and not stuffy. Nice pool with lanes marked for lap swimming. Buffet breakfast at Shula's was fantastic, with made-to-order waffles and omelets, along with other selections. I would have eaten a lot more if I didn't have to checkout to attend a 11 am dance class. Parking is $6/night, but I was comped. Front desk very friendly.
