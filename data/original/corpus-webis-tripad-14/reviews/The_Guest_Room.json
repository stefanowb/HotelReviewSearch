Katrina and Fergus are very welcoming and superb hosts. Breakfast is brought to you on a tray so you can enjoy it in peace and at your leisure.

Our experience of The Guest Room was less favourable than other reviews, instead of feeling welcome, my wife and I felt more of an inconvenience and both commented that the B&B seemed to be just a sideline/hobby to the owners and experienced none of the touches that other guests have commented on. We were hurredly shown to our room (at the owners convenience, as we had to time our arrival to suit them, before they were off out again). The only other time we saw them was when breakfast was brought to our room and then when we left. There was no wardrobe in the room to hang our clothes, no water in the room, there were tea making facilities but at no point was there any milk to take advantage of them and at no point did any of the famous shortbread materialise (although it was promised)! The room was ice cold and we had to ask for the heating to be left on so that we didn\u2019t freeze. Breakfast was hit and miss - porridge was nice, croissants (under cooked on two mornings), fruit for two (which only fed one!) and small glasses of orange juice. The nice big comfy bed was welcome at the end of the day, but our sleep was interrupted early morning by the owners children running around upstairs, so any chance of a lie in was out the window. What really annoyed me was that in our confirmation email, it stated that if there was no parking available near the B&B the owners would direct us to free parking a short while away and then bring us back to the B&B. Upon arrival, there was no assistance with this and we ended up having to pay for parking for a over a day, which wasn\u2019t cheap! Although I was going to walk out within hours of our arrival and book into a hotel, my wife wanted to persevere and so wanted to like the place, the location was fantastic, but there were too many annoyances for us to truly enjoy our stay and we have stayed at more professional and welcoming B&B\u2019s than this. I\u2019d like to think that the owners were having a momentary lapse due to the other good reviews on here, but at the end of the day, my experience was not good so I am unable to recommend The Guest House and will seek alternative accomodation on my next visit to Edinburgh. To top it all off, I returned home to find an email from the owner stating that they had not received our deposit cheque and requesting that we sent them another cheque. Having checked my bank account, the cheque was debited from my account two months previous, I advised them of this and have still received no reply/confimation/apology for their oversight, to me this was another indication of the lack of attention that they pay to their business. Luckily for us, everything else about our trip to Edinburgh was excellent, just a shame about the B&B!", "title": "Very disappointing", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "adethomp", "date": "December 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 89764174}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We really enjoyed our stay at The Guest Room last week!
