We were very disapointed upon entering our guest room. Yes it is new, and clean and fresh, but there is no character at all, my wife commented it was like staying at a very expensive Hampton Inn, without the swimming pool. After about ten minutes in the room we heard a very loud noise and realized it was the plumbing from the neighboring room, needless to say at that point we called the inn we had spent the two previous nights in over on Cayuga lake and found that our room was still available, we quickly grabbed our bags, and headed back to the other Inn. We didnt even argue with the front desk staff, we said charge us for the night, not even stopping to sample the wine. Good luck working out the kinks in the first year. We do not plan on returning.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "J.Tucker", "date": "September 30, 2004", "id": 2609948}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wow!!", "text": "My wife and I just returned from a couple of days at Belhurst Castle with another couple. After reading some of the reviews here I thought I might have made a bad decision going there, but we were pleasently surprised. The staff was friendly and helpful, the accomodations and food was good (the breakfast buffett was a little cold), and the free flowing wine faucet kept us in a good mood. We will probably go back again someday.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Travelguru4u", "date": "September 26, 2004", "id": 2602245}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent overall- no complaints.

First night we stayed in the Tower suite. A little pricey but worth it. Second night we stayed in the Garrett room. It was like going from the penthouse to the outhouse. Tiny room, AC barely worked, bed squeeked. Avoid this room. Service was good. Had dinner onsite at Edgar's. We ordered shrimp and pasta dishes that were extremely bland. Once again service was good.

It is more a hotel room than bed and breakfast atmosphere but the room was very spacious and the fireplace and jacuzzi were wonderful on a cool fall night. The grounds and the gorgeous view were worth the price. The breakfast buffet was ok -some of the food was cold and so were the plates but at $7.00 it isn't so overpriced. They do have a continental breakfast which they didn't tell us about - we stumbled upon it.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "edengelegi", "date": "November 14, 2004", "id": 2824807}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "An enchanting fall getaway!", "text": "The staff was all very nice.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 27, 2004", "id": 2790812}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 45, "average": 43, "very good": 69, "terrible": 70, "excellent": 117}, "aka": "Belhurst - Chambers In The Castle Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "On the shores of Seneca Lake in the heart of the Finger Lakes Wine Region, Belhurst takes you away to a place filled with history, beauty and breathtaking views.
