Had a great corner room with a view of the pool serpent slide and the river. Our family of 4, two aduts, 6 ys old and 11 yr old fit well into the room. The beds are a bit small, but if you want a bigger bed, you need to move up in price range. Staff were friendly and the grounds were clean. The resort has cute brick streets and quient grounds,,makes you feel like you're in a little city. Everything is very close to your room, that includes laundry, hot tub, pool bar, game room etc. The 1 hotel restaurant was cafteria style, the food selection was good. If you're a coffee/tea drinker get the hotel disney mug right away, free refills during your stay plus it's a great souvenier, (I still use it now), it's well worth the 15 bucks. Plus, if you're doing the dinning plan, note: a small salad is cosidered a dessert or snack. I gained 5lbs on the dinner plan because I didn't realize till my 2nd to last day, that I could sub a salad for a dessert. Bonuses: French Quarter is is a short walk or boat ride to Port Orleans Riverside, you can use the amenities of that resort which looked very nice, but much bigger, Riverside does have both a sit down restaurant, (only open for dinner) as well as a cafteria (a bit bigger than French Quarter). The one pool at Riverside (with life guards, which is what I prefer) seems to be a bit of a walk from the rooms, the boat ride to Downtown disney is a must do, I've read reviews that some of the resorts are too big, French Quarter is the smallest of the Disney resorts, if you have small children or individuals that are disabled this is the resort for you.
