So I didn\u2019t deal with the check in. the group of let\u2019s say 40 pax arrived 1 pm. but one elevator is broken. The elevator itself is quite small. I think can fit 5 people with baggage. Many have to use stair. I used stair for 4th floor only let my mom get in. The room is okay. Extra bed is not so nice. They put the futon instead of mattress so my bed was a bit too soft. Breakfast is fine. They have champagne for breakfast I guess it\u2019s a Paris thing. The waitress saw us and suddenly took to the room with Chinese group. The black waiter came and asked us room no., he checked and brought us outside. (as we came with German tour group) Breakfast is acceptable for 3 stars hotel. There is metro station near the hotel but we didn\u2019t use. Overall if you want a short stay with the better price, It\u2019s not too bad otherwise you can pay more and stay closer to Paris.", "title": "Reasonable for short stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "r_noi", "date": "October 22, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 119574552}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.

I don't mean in a \"French people are rude\"-stereotypical fashion, they were just - well, rude. We checked into the hotel at 1am after a long travel day, so I fumbled with my French, then just went for English - I was told that I should \"speak French, then English\". When we checked out, they claimed we hadn't paid when we had. The desk clerk had not seen the email confirming we had. She fought us for a while, then when she realised her mistake, was absolutely frosty. The only person who was nice was one of the female desk clerks, who was only nice after she had to tell us bad news. The bad news was that despite the brochure claiming that laundry was available Monday to Saturday and could be picked up by 8pm same day if put in by 9am, we attempted to put through laundry on a Friday morning before 9am and were told it wouldn't be ready until after the weekend. Reason why? \"The laundry is not open on the weekend\".

The shower is a bit dodgy, the water pressure if fine but the shower attachment is so poor that the whole floor will be able to accomadate Nemo by the time your shower is over. The television channels are all in French bar BBC world news however it is not specific to any continent so you will find it impossible to get specific news. Do not let small children near the windows as they are very wide and open fully so children need to be constantly supervised. Breakfast is a bit dodgy, it's mainly continental and consists of 10% fruit yogurt, croissants, make it yourself toast and some abigiuous looking sausage and bacon and some distinctly saw dust looking scrambled eggs. If you are going in the week you will probably be ok because there is a restaurant however we came at the weekend and there is no restaurant and there is also no room service so the only way to get food is to go around the corner of the hotel to a kind of mini mall which has restaurants like mcdonalds, kfc, a pizza place amongst others as well as some nice shops but the area is questionable. Some people have commented how they feel unsafe and there are some \"suspicious\" looking people outside that some people may find unnerving. Staff are not particulary helpful or friendly and seem unaccustomed to dealing with people so aren't much help if you require it. It is also important to note that this hotel is not particularly close to central Paris. But as mentioned earlier it's very clean which is good however that is just our experience we have heard from other guests that their rooms are dirty and have things like cracked tiles in them. Another comment would be that, in our case, we booked a twin bed room but we were given a room with a double bed, not a huge problem but could be for others. Also you can hear you can hear everything that goes on in the floors above. The lifts are quite cramped and can only hold a small number of 4/5 at a time which may be an issue for some people. There isn't anything really to do in the hotel if you don't want to go out given the lack of television or in-hotel entertainment, the shops close at 8pm every day except for Sunday when they are all shut so it would be advisable to bring some sort of entertainment with you. An important tip to anyone going to stay here would be to bring some food as well as entertainment just in case because their isn't anything avaliable in the hotel. Good option possibly for anyone using this hotel on a business trip but not a holiday, personally we would not book this hotel again.", "title": "Would not recommend", "user": "scmommy8", "date": "May 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 109852345}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010", "text": "I stayed here as part of a group of college students I was helping to lead around Europe, and this was one of our least favorite hotels.

Also, even though they supposedly have air conditioning, it didn't work in any one of the 8 rooms we had for our group.
