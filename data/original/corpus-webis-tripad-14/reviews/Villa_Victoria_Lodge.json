The Rodriguez family is very welcoming and the caretakers make you feel at home. Contrary to some of the reviews, pretty much everything is homemade from the freshly baked croissant to the homemade jams. The grounds are massive and the pool is refreshing. It is true that the mansion is a good 30 minute drive from the city of Mendoza and that the downtown restaurants in Maipu require access to a car. That being said I would NOT recommend renting a car in Mendoza. Villa Victoria offers transfers from the airport and the taxis should be sufficient for transportation.
