From the moment you arrive, there are some great touches. Reception is not a desk, but a central console, where you feel very much at one with the process. They have a snack table there, which changes throughout the day and offers everything from sweets, to cookies and even wine in the evening. There is also complimentary coffee. Rooms are large, with free WiFi, tea/coffee (my only gripe is that the coffee is instant), large rain showers and even a cool Japanese toilet. The room also has complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the minibar and fruit. The Lobby has a homely feel to it, with books to read. There is a great gym and very cool glass swimming pool in the basement. The restaurant offered a nice selection of Asian and International cuisine. On one night there was a great \"sampler\" menu, enabling you to try out miniature dishes from the a la carte menu available on other nights. Staff are friendly, helpful and come with personality.

I'd happily recommend it for business or pleasure. The design of the building is fantastic - from the lobby, to the more casual and welcoming reception, right through to the bedrooms, bathrooms and spa/gym areas. I was really impressed every one of my 5 days there. The service was very efficient, helpful and surprisingly relaxed - nothing stiff or awkward about it. I loved the room - stylish, modern, with some lovely Asian touches and the bathroom, mood lighting and automated blinds were the right blend of practical, stylish and attractive. The views were great, the location of the hotel opposite Xintiandi was very convenient - it's central but also easy to walk across the road for a wander/shop/dinner after work. I only ate one night in the restaurant, but it was tasty and quick, breakfast was excellent every day. It wasn't until the last day that I visited the pool/spa area and wished I'd gone down earlier - really great set up.", "title": "Great by Design", "user": "MandyMeerkat", "date": "March 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155468665}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013", "text": "Location is great fifth time my husband checks in my second time asked for a complimentary breakfast answer in Chinese English but u have to payyyy more!

Andaz has to realise its light display does not make it a five star regret not checking into langham. Even the flower display in lobby is exact same as last year! Haha! The wall when u enter the room is full of marks! Total waste of money. I advise whoever wants comfort should not opt for andaz. Try it if u want to see a display of lights changing in it washroom which starts looking tacky after a while. The rustic smell is killing me gotta get out of this room. Sigh!

First, the check-in/check-out counter is too casual, unorganized. A series of square kitchen block modules, guests are standing in each others way trying to check-in/check-out with absolutely no privacy as to one's personal details/hotel bill.
