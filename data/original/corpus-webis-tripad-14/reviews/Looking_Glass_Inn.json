I checked it out on line and thought $99 for a jacuzzi suite there had to be something wrong. I was plesently surprised. I have stayed in nicer rooms but at more than triple the cost of this one. (Granted it was February so prices were at the lowest they were gonna go and it was FREEZING outside.) We stayed on the top floor and although the staight ocean view wasn't right in your face like at you'd see from Spanish Head you could see the surf off in the distance. You did have a great view of the bay and the sealions. My husband got up real early one morning to jog the beach and there were a few babies up on the shore on this side of the bay. Nothing was better after a chilly walk then coming into that room turning on the fireplace and jumping in that tub. Part of the reason we are waiting till Sept to go back.

I would only suggest staying here if you get one of the jacuzzi suites because for a regular room or suite there are better deals to be had in hotels with better views and more amenities down the beach.

We found the Inn on the Internet before leaving - and made it a destination point. When we actually arrived, I wasn't impressed. None of the rooms are physically oceanside. A few offer some views - but most views are of parking lots with an ocean in the background. The hotel seems to be of cheap wood construction. Some generators (as I found out in the morning) mounted to the outside of our end unit kept vibrating our suite the entire night. I couldn't sleep. We also heard the guests upstairs a little too clearly. Our suite was equipped with a jacuzzi tub, but the hot water ran out before it was filled - and the jets were dirty. What saved me from marking this hotel \"terrible\" is its breakfast.

The hotel is across the street from Mo's restaurant and also a short walk to the beach/Siletz Bay. The only advice I have is to stay in a room on the 2nd floor, otherwise you have a view of the parking lot :( and you'll want to keep your curtains closed most the time to keep people from looking into your room! Other than that, the prices are reasonable and the rooms seem to be updated & modern. Oh and their continental breakfast is awesome!!!
