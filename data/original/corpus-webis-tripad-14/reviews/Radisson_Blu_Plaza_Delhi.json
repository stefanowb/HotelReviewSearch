Immediate access to a large, luxurious hotel on arrival in the middle of the night after an inter-continental flight is welcome and therapeutic. The hotel is as modern and solid as the newly constructed terminal building at the airport. I did not know until morning that four levels of vehicular traffic were situated outside my hotel window, the soundproofing was so good. The full services of the hotel include a wonderful breakfast buffet. The hotel room was large, well-furnished, and filled with welcome features. This is better than your everyday hotel, but it fills a solid set of needs extremely well.", "title": "Welcome luxury", "user": "Bill350", "date": "November 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 145476639}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled on business", "text": "My husband and I have stayed at this hotel many times now, and it has always been a pleasure. The hotel is very pleasant, and the rooms are comfortable, and the food is very good. What we like most about this hotel is its staff - they are very caring, always available, extremely attentive, and makes you feel welcome and important. The only one thing to complain about is that the temperatures in the rooms cannot be easily controlled, and when it gets too cool inside, one can only switch off the A/C. The hotel is situated very near the airport, and that's convenient, but even for shopping, there are good malls in Vasant Kunj, which is only 15 minutes away. Getting to the centre of town can be a long drive, and don't attempt it at rush hour. The hotel is also a very good venue for a meeting.", "title": "VERY GOOD PRACTICAL HOTEL", "user": "nimmigunase", "date": "November 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 145432656}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "hotel is situated approx 45 minutes drive from the airport, car pick up is available.
