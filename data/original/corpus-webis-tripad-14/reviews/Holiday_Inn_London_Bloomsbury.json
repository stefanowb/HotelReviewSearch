The focus seems to be more on squeezing extra money out of guests vs. providing exceptional service. Upon checking in you will be asked to purchase prepaid vouchers for the breakfast buffet . After agreeing to purchase I realized on my checkout day I'd be leaving very early for the airport my last morning and would not be able to have breakfast. I requested that I be charged for only 3 breakfasts instead of 4, but was apathetically informed that the vouchers were \"non-refundable\". But I said \"It is your own restaurant\", to which I was received an apathetic stare and was told I could talk to a manager but she would tell me the same thing.", "title": "Very Disappointed", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Dan F", "date": "June 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 133074154}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled on business", "text": "This was just the first in a sequence of negative experiences: 1) once turned on the air conditioning is programmed to turn itself off at certain internals - fully off, so when you return to your room or wake up at night it is steamy hot; 2) the room itself is cramped.

Got to room eventually, the rooms are very small indeed although they were clean and the decor not to unpleasant, not much room to move around really. The bathroom was average but very clean. The beds are also very small, really, i would imagine a tall person may find thier legs sticking out the end.The view from the room is awful, looks out into back of hotel, all the pipes and vents, room was also very hot, cant open the windows. The only problem we had with anything during our stay was that a dirty cup was left, they only left one clean one, and they only left us one clean bath towel, however a call to reception resolved the matter and housekeeping very quickly brought us up two more towels.
