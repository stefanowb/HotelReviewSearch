I am a particular fan of this hotel's aesthetic - the japanese feel, great fit out, fabrics, low lighting etc - so I was won over from the very beginning. The rooms aren't huge and for a couple of men, sharing the smaller than king size bed was something I had to get used to. But the rooms are very efficient, well designed, beautifully fitted out and with great toiletries in the bathrooms. The Japanese restaurant (Matsuri) was so popular we could not get a table - this was a great disappointment for us so make sure you book. We did order from the restaurant menu in our room so make sure you don't miss the black cod!

Initial impressions may not be a glitzy as some hotels in New York - but once you settle in, the hotel is a fantastic choice. Firstly the rates are excellent - very good value for money. The hotel also has a good location - close to Chelsea, Meatpacking District and The Village - so good for shopping, nightlife, restaurants and central for getting around the city. Rooms are small with queen size beds (but this is the norm in NYC), but well designed with lovely bed linen, tv/dvd/stereo, complimentary wi-fi, fantastic shower (but no tub) and the best mini bar selection you will ever come across. There are two restaurant choices. Matsui is one of the best Japanese restaurants in the city and La Botega offers a good breakfast (love the oatmeal and latte) and a nice selection of Italian cuisine. The full menu from both restaurants are also available on Room Service, which makes a pleasant change from the 'club sandwich & ceasar salad' options that so many hotels offer. There is a also a nice 'laid back' bar with a DJ at the weekends (not the most happening place in town, but a good vibe). Staff are very friendly - a little informal at times, but it suits the style of the place. All in all, this is a great option for both a leisure trip, or low maintenence business traveller.

Firstly, it still resembles the former port authourity building it once housed and the entrance is small and dark with quite a few steep steps up (not sure what wheelchair users would do). The lobby is dark but decorated with great thought and attention and the whole hotel retains the nautical theme throughout. Although the hotel is small, it's a real boutique and rather eccentric - refreshingly it has none of the hall marks of a NYC hotel chain. The rooms are small - the kind that you can walk in, walk around the bed and that's pretty much it, but this is NY and one starts to accept that space is a major extravagance in this city. However the room is well appointed and has a great comfortable bed. All the essentials are provided plus the power shower is pretty refreshing.

Matsui, the downstairs Japanese restaurant is superb and the sashimi was fresh and well cut. The restaurant itself is massive and feels like being in Tokyo. The gym is pretty small, slightly airless and has one running machine and bike and some free weights - to be honest, I never met anyone else in the gym so it was fine for me, although the basement floor is stuffy. At the weekends, actually from Thursday night onwards, the hotel is ovetaken by crowds of scantily dressed 18 year olds partying with friends. This is fine, but the associated noise is ridiculously loud and at 4am I could still hear revellers departing the hotel club, Hiro. The plughole that's provided by management is a good temporary solution to the noise, but it is large and cumbersome and nearly knocked me on the bed when I tried to place it at the window. Once attached, the room does indeed become soundproof but also becomes pitch black resembles being in a bunker. However, that is the most negative I can get about the Martime, as the overall hotel is a real gem. The staff are friendly and accomodating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes the nightlife of a city, but also wants something a little different.

They are clean, with comfy beds and nice amenities. What sets this hotel apart is the trendy location, nightlife and population.
