I had no idea where the lounge was, how we'd get access to it, or anything. The Cast Member who checked us in was friendly but not very helpful. So anyhow, we were too early to get a room, so we had them hold our luggage for us while we went to the parks. We were allowed to go to the concierge lounge and have some snacks, which was nice. We had some little snacks, grabbed some small bottles of water and went on our way. Throughout the day they have different snacks available. Morning time there is a continental breakfast with pastries, fruit, cereals, bread, juices & coffee. Then later in the day there are cookies, fruit, little sandwiches. Happy Hour they have free drinks (we didnt attend so I am not sure what they offered) and cheese & crackers, cookies. Then at night there are dessert foods. The lounge itself was nice, but during breakfast it was hard to find a place to sit. They have a patio that you can stand on to watch the Disneyland Fireworks, which is pretty cool. We were not there for that, but heard people talking about it. You get turndown service, but we were in the room when they went by so we didnt use that. They did give us some wrapped chocolates, though. The concierge desk is right outside the lounge, they always had a line of people waiting to see them - they will make reservations for you for meals, tours, etc. We didnt use them. We ended up having breakfast, a couple snacks and grabbing some bottled waters. Was it worth the added $$$ - for us no. If you are the type to hang around the hotel all day, then it might be. We just were not in our room enough to make it worthwhile. We were also told when I made the reservation that you could use the lounge after you check out, but that is not the case.
