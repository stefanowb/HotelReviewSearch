The owner told us we had to vacate the room (we had purchased food etc), because the suite had bed bugs! We were then told by the owner that there was no other suite available. We were understandably upset and the owner kept saying it was not her fault. I understood it was not her fault but her cleaning staff should have changed the bed sheets and noticed the bed bugs. My sister who was with on the vacation has multiple disabilities. The next day, she had bad bug bites on her back. The owner did help us find another place to stay but not after complaining and being rude. We have photos of her bed bug bites but never pursued anything with the owner.

A mini fridge was in the room as well. We were within an easy walking distance of Mt Baldi and the chain ferry which we used to reach town (operated until 9:00 p.m. that week which was fine for dinner with children). It was also an easy drive to Douglas and Oval Beach. The pool was a nice temperature and clean, the only downside being the traffic going to and from Oval Beach. There are several outside seating areas for enjoying morning coffee or ordering in dinner to enjoy on property. There are muffins and coffee for breakfast - plenty since there are so many good restaurants to try in the area. Pool towels, paperbacks and videos are provided at no charge and the staff was polite and helpful. While you do not have a totally unobstructed view of the river and harbor, it is fun to glimpse all the huge boats making their way on the river.
