We drove in so I have no advice about the airport distance. The hotel is nice, the rooms are very modern. Very comfortable beds & a nice shower. My only complaint for the room was that the light above the sink & vanity was out, we went to report it only to see a note that due to a manufaturer defect that all the lights above the bathroom vanity were out. Not a terribly big deal, but it does make putting on makeup a little harder & it was the only mirror in the entire room. So ladies if you stay here I'd just suggest you bring an extra mirror so you can use it where there is more light. Parking was validated through the front desk each day & the hotel charged us $18 to park per day. They had a little food nook so to speak across from the front desk, but we never patronized it. From the looks of it though they offered both hot & cold items, fruit etc but nothing complimentary. The room contains the basics iron, ironing board & fridge, no microwave, but there was one downstairs in the nook. The fridge had 2 complimentary bottles of water. The staff was very nice & helpful when we had questions. The hotel is very close to a convention center (there was a Comicon convention there the same weekend we were there) it looks to be in walking distance. The hotel is also very close to highway I90. There was construction in front of the entrance so make sure you turn into the correct lot.
