I was not expecting to share a bath for $189.00 per night. The room did have a sink that was not functioning. The food was ok, but certainly not memorable. I was not thrilled to be served \"family style\" (only a few tables were everyone sat together). For $30 per person I was expecting more than platters of roadhouse food. On the bright side, the people were very nice and had lots of good information on the area. After Dinner there was a slide show on flightseeing, note: go flight seeing rather than watching a slide show on it!
