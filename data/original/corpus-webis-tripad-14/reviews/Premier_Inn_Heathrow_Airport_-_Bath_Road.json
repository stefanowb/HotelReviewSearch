The service from the staff was unobtrussive and business-like; they were able to address my needs adequately but perhaps were not going out of their way to make sure every little thing was perfect. The one main thing to consider about this hotel is location. If you've never been to London before and are visiting as a tourist, this is probably not the place for you. To get to the central tourist areas requires a bus ride to a tube station, then a further 15 stop tube ride or so before you're in central London. This only costs about $5 pounds, but you'll spend a lot of time commuting if you're real goal is in the middle of London - at least 2 or 3 hours a day. On the other hand, if you have a flight the next day or business at the airport or in the Houslow area; this hotel is ideal. For the price this hotel can not be beat, and almost no hotel in central London is this new.
