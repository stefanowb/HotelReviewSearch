{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 618, "name": "Hampton by Hilton York", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel really is well located, ideal for parking (\u00a310 for 24hrs, \u00a32 on the street 18h00 - 08h00 but watch out for wardens after 8h30!!). The hotel is new and therefore has a few 'issues' which I am sure will be resolved in time. Our main problem was non functioning air con during our stay in July. It was 27\u00b0 outside and about 35\u00b0 Inside. We foolishly thought that the room would get cooler as the air con setting only goes down to 19\u00b0. It didn't. In fact, it was blowing out hot air and we Windows did not open. We should have been offered a different room when we complained that morning - or perhaps I should have insisted. Instead, after two unsuccessful visits from the technician, we moved rooms the following evening to a blissfully cool room on the 5th floor. Tip: Avoid room 219 and if the room does not cool, insist on being moved straight away!!! The breakfasts were fine and predictable though the peak time of 8h15 - 9h15 must be avoided. The room is too small and the furniture not suitable for breakfasts (heavy chairs and tables). Many guests simply give up waiting for a free table and the atmosphere is chaotic. The staff do their best but they can only work with what they have. On the other hand the quiet period after 7.30 is fine. The room is well appointed though it could do with a mini fridge. The sliding door seving both the wardrobe and bathroom is also a bit strange and inconvenient if one person is sifting through the cupboard when the other wants to get out of the bathroom (ooch!). On the whole the hotel is probably a good choice, when all things function.", "title": "Well located hotel with a few issues", "user": "BillParis", "date": "July 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 169837521}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "The final hotel on our ride to York from London and what a pleasant surprise this was.

Cooked breakfast available each morning with cereals etc included in proce of room, Cooked breakfast always consisted of same items - always sausages, bacon , scrambled eggs, tinned tomatoes and beans. Hotel spotlessly clean - super toiletries provided free. Close to station and within the city walls excellent location.
