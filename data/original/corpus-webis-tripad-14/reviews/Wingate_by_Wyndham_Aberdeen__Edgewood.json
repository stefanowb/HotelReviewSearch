The beds were comfortable and the down comforter made for a very restful night. Breakfast in the morning was a real treat they had a wide variety of foods (from healthy to hearty) something for everyone.

We had stayed at a Country Inn & Suites down the street the last time, and it was super in all areas, but no indoor pool, so this time we picked Wingate because of the indoor pool. We figured the other amenities would be about the same. We were a little disapointed. Not in the indoor pool, but the breakfast was not quite as nice as the Comfort, and they seemed to have a housekeeping staff problem. I think most of them were new. They only left the minimum in linens in the bathroom. It seemed we were always having to ask for things. The housekeeping staff sometimes didn't seem to know the policy on what was expected of them. They seemed to try and get by with just the minimum on cleaning the room. We were told the glasses and cups, which were really glass, not paper, weren't replaced daily. We were responisble for cleaning them. An extra pillow was delivered without a pillow case because the girl said they didn't have any more. It seemed to be more of a management training problem than anything, but the aggravation of the little nit picking things became a little annoying.
