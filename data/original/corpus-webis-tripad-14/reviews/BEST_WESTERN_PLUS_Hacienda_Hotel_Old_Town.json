I also really loved the pick up service at the airport. That was so helpful. I was at the hotel for a wedding and had two seperate reservations for two days each with a night in between where I stayed elsewhere. But a few problems to note, 1. Our room was not ready in time for check in. It took a few hours to find us a room. However when we did get the room it was beautiful so there is that. 2. We had to cancel one night of our second reservation. I understand that you have a 48 hour policy but it was not posted anywhere. I notified the hotel within 24 hours and they rebooked the room with another guest but still I was charged the full amount of the stay. I felt that this was slightly unethical since the hotel recouped the money twice. 3. While most of the staff that I dealt with was very friendly even when I was voicing a complaint about the above two issues. When I did check in the second time at night (around 12:30 am) there was a staff member who had a bit of an attitude which was a bit surprising because I was not voicing a complaint, just checking in. She might have just been having a bad day because she was also short with the gentleman who was ahead of us in line. But then when it was our turn next she barked at us asking whether we were guests at the hotel. Then she seemed a bit nicer when we told her we were checking in but then when we asked for a wake up call and cab in the morning this was just too much for her and she was aggrevated again. 4. my bill was incorrect the first time i checked out but it was fixed immediately as soon as I pointed it out. 5. while the breakfast far exceeded my expectations in that it was really delicious, the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. But the service was awful. We must have waited 20 minutes for a waiter to take our order and then almost 40 minutes for it to show up. I had to go to the kitchen myself to get a drink. 6. wifi did not work at all in the hotel room or lobby but the computers in the lobby were great and loved the printer for my boarding pass. 7. I did not appreciate the $5 a day resort fee which was basically for two bottles of water that were not replenished every day.
