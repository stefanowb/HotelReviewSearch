We took advantage of the LivingSocial escape package for a Memorial Day getaway and were so thrilled with our experience. The inn was comfy and cozy, lots of places to relax alone or interact with other guests. Part of our package included wine and cheese, which Patty was sweet enough to serve us on the back patio overlooking the creek. The breakfasts were delicious, and they were so wonderful about accommodating my gluten-free needs (they asked about food allergies when we made the reservation, and then again upon arrival) and even had some gluten free cookies placed in the room! The guest rooms were very nicely appointed (best sleep I\u2019ve had in ages!) with wonderful little details like wine glasses and a corkscrew, snacks, and pre-stamped post cards! The inn has wifi and lots of games and movies for entertainment.

Patty and Dan are wonderful hosts and very knowledgeable about the area. Our first night, we went to dinner in Staunton at the Mill Creek Grill. Our whole experience there was great - food, service and the mint ice cream at the end! After our first delicious breakfast, we headed down to the caverns at Natural Bridge. Definitely a must see if you never have. We didn't do Natural Bridge so we could do it as a family with our kiddos. On our way down, we took the Goshen Pass road which was beautiful. I think we stopped every 100 yards once entering the pass to take pictures. It had rained the night before and the water was really flowing. After we left Staunton, we drove to Lexington and took the carriage ride through downtown. Your driver and guide do a great job of shoeing you most of the historic sites in the town and I was amazed at how much history took place right there in Lexington. We finished up with dinner in downtown at the Southern Inn, another wonderful restaurant and topped it off with ice cream from Sweet Things. Yum! We stayed in the Teter-Wood room which is the only room downstairs so it was really very private. The other couples that were there were either in their own rooms on the second floor or out of the house so it was like having the whole downstairs area to yourself!

We enjoyed a tour of the area (sites recommended by Patty and Dan) as well as a visit to Washington and Lee College in Lexington. A visit to Thomas J Jackson's house is also a requirement once in town. Later in the day we went to Staunton for dinner and a play at the local theatre.
