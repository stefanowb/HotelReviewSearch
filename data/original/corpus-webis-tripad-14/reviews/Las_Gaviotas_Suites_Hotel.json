It is very clean, the rooms are generously sized and the fixtures and fittings are of a high quality. We had a room on the top floor overlooking the bigger pool which was a bit noisy but didn't really disrupt us, and we had great views of the surrounding countryside. The pools are nice places to spend time in and around and there is a small indoor spa pool with a sauna and steam room which seems to get hardly used. We both had an hour long massage which was fairly good value at 50 euros. The drinks are cheap about \u00a32 for a large beer or very large glass of wine) and the food at the poolside bar is of a very good quality and sensibly priced. The staff are also superb and really helpful. We stayed bed and breakfast and found the dining room a bit too busy and noisy for our liking. We did tend to eat late, so perhaps if we'd gone earlier it would have been better. We also found it a bit hit and miss as to what was on offer. There was also no table service, meaning you had to go and get tea and coffee yourself. Curiously there were also no tea and coffee facilities in the room (even a Travelodge room has them), and you had to pay to hire a safe. But these are really minor gripes and for the price we paid, at peak season, we were satisfied.", "title": "Fab hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jo P", "date": "August 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136549656}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "LOCATION AND SURROUNDING AREA", "title": "100% excellence", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "pilotgirl", "date": "August 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136372316}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent hotel and location", "text": "The big thing that lets the hotel down is its location. It is on a main road through the centre of the resort with constant traffic. There is a bar terrace at the front which would be a lot nicer if they put some terracing and shrubbery/fencing up to shield it from the constant noise. We also felt they were missing a trick by not having a bar at the rear of the hotel around the big pool. The resort itself is very disappointing. Aside from a bizarrely large number of Spar stores and a few tacky bars and restaurants, there is not much to see - although the beach is nice but very crowded. We took to getting the bus to Alcudia Old Town and Port D'alcudia in the evening where there are many more restaurants and generally more pleasant surroundings. However the bus service can be a bit erratic and be aware that they get very crowded from 7-8pm and 10-11pm. We also drove to Soller one day which was very pleasant - but make sure you take the Palma road route otherwise you will end up dizzy from the number of hairpin bends! Port Pallenca is also recommended, although at night the bus stops running at 9pm and a taxi will cost you almost 20 euros.", "user": "Karen H", "date": "August 3, 2012", "id": 136111139}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Only after reading all the constant brilliant reviews of this hotel we booked this through Thomson for the first week of July. Coach dropped us off round the corner from the hotel, driver of the coach just pointed in the direction of the hotel. First impressions were really good, lovely reception. Our suite was on the ground floor and when entering it smelt musty and a drain type smell greeted us. Suite was beautiful, equipped with fridge which came in very handy. Our room backed the other hotels rear car park, so every night we had to endue their bins being emptied, early morning delivery drivers etc. Every evening at 11pm the sprinklers came on which completely soaked the balcony. Our main problem was the food, it was always cold, you were ok if you got there when it had just come out but if it had been sitting there it was always cold, not impressed at all with the selection of food, we had to rely on the chef for his grills.
