The arrangements were seamless, and whilst possibly a little more expensive than other tours (there are some real bargain basement offers around town), the quality we got for what we paid was amazing, leaving unwanted luggage safely at the hotel whilst we went off on trips, when we returned it was ready and waiting in our rooms. Accompanied to the train station for the overnight Sapa train (it can be quite confusing but the hotel guy took us to our compartment and then went off to get us cold beers) and met us when we returned. The location of the hotel is superb, in the Old Quarter and right next to bia hoi corner. The hotel happily got cheap, reliable taxi's whenever we needed them (you have to be very careful of taxi scams in Hanoi, stick to Mai Linh or Taxi Group, they are reliably metered and really cheap, most places just over a pound sterling). Breakfast was very good, great choice and they start early so you can eat before any early starts. The service is impeccable, going above and beyond any hotel we have stayed in.
