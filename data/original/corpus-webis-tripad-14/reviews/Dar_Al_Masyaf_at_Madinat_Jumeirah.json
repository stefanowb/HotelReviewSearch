The room is spacious, clean and well equipt, you are also so well looked after by the staff. The Dar Al Masyaf summerhouses have there own staff with lobby area, between 6 - 8 in the evening they hold a complimentry drinks service, you can anything you like from the branded drinks they also have on offer champagne. Our daughter was so well treated as well, on arrival she received a teddy bear and complimentry tolietry set, and every night on her pillow she received other little things like rubber ducks, lip balm, games and sweets. The villas also share private pools which are always so peaceful if you like to get away from the bussle of the large al qsar pool. The food was wonderful, we particularly liked the mina a salam buffet restaurant with its outdoor eating area with the view of the Burj al arab. We didnt find the drinks or food overly priced which we did expect as it is Dubai. Transport around the large hotel complex is either by golf buggy or by the little boats around the waterways, the water taxis are a lovely novelty. On the Madinat complex, it has its own souk with restaurants and shops, this gives you a different aspect as it does actually feel as though you are venturing out away from the hotel for a meal or drink. The hotel also has a very professional spa, the massage is a real treat.
