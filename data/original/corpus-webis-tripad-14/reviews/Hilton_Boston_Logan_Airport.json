Boston hotels are very expensive, especially 4+stars. This hotel meet our expectations and more. You can use the hotels courtesy shuttle to the airport or walk via the skybridge. Very easy walk with luggage on wheels. Upon check in we were upgraded to executive level that had awesome views. I was sceptical but the rooms were truely soundproofed for airport traffic-- watched planes taxi and take off but never heard them. We did however hear our neighbor flush toilet more than once. Room to room soundproofing not quite as impressive as the outside noise soundproofing. Courtesy shuttle was also more than willing to drop us off at subway. Very helpful staff. Clean room, nice amenities. Food very expensive and not worth it. In room coffee was surprisingly good. Beds were not very comfortable. We had just come from a few days at a Marriott and they have very comfortable beds. Had been advised there is a charge to use business center computers, however bellman told us we could print boarding passes for free at computer next to elevator. There is a 24 hour dunkin donuts in the airport. Easy to walk over via skybridge and get coffee and donuts anytime day or night.

No need to worry, they did. Even at 1:00 a.m. they had plenty of front desk staff to attend to us as well as other travelers.
