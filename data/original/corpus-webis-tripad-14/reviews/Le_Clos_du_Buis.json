Charming hotel with a cute back yard with pool and a lovely view of the Luberon valley from the breakfast area. The proprietors were very friendly and helpful. It felt like having our own pied a terre in Provence (particularly since we never saw anyone else in the living room area). Our room, which was on the first floor completely separated from any other guest rooms (which were all upstairs), was a good size, simply decorated and very clean, with a shower and large tub. Unlike other reviewers, dinner was not served at the hotel during our stay. Bonnieux is a much less touristy town than other \"perched villages\" in Provence, with several nice restaurants, including one steps away, with great views. We had not heard much about this place before going, and were very pleasantly surprised.", "title": "Charming Spot in Provence", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Geebs", "date": "January 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4330118}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Charming Le Clos du Buis", "text": "We spent eight delightful nights at the charming Le Clos du Bois located in the lovely hill top town, Bonnieux.

Which was fortunate as Le Clos de Buis, the bed and breakfast which we wound up spending the next 12 nights, was fabulous! The property is located in the village, one short flight of stairs away from several great resaurants, and the owners have beautifully renovated a family property into 8 large, individually decorated bedrooms all with up-to-date baths, showers and separate WCs. There is even a suite specifically geared towards handicapped travellers with direct access from the street, complete with kitchenette. Breakfasts were served in a wonderful glassed-in room overlooking the Luberon valley and the communal lounge/TV room hosted an enoromous fireplace which was kept lit in the cool March evenings. Great ambience. The hosts were extremely helpful (making dinner and hotel reservations for us and generally providing great touring tips) and their \"gal Friday\", Sophie, speaks English fluently, in case your French is not up to snuff. The rates, which include parking in an enclosed parking lot adjacent to the property, are extremely reasonable considering the quality of what we got. I can not recommend it highly enough.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 22, 2003", "id": 978268}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We ended our 2007 tour of Provence at Le Clos du Bois.
