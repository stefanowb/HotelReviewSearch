It had heating in the bedrooms and bathroom and was very very spacious for the 5 of us. Seton Sands itself was lovely although not loads to do with very young children. We had dry and sunny weather all weekend and had a couple of walks across the road on the beach which was nice. The swimming pool area was clean enough my wee boy loved it! Night entertainment wase enjoyable the sort of stuff you expect at these places - Mikey one of the funstars was great with the kids. There is a spar and a chippy on site which are both very reasonably priced - the chips are gorgeous. We paid a total of \u00a3155 for the 5 of us including the upgrade and it was well worth the money. I don't think I would pay the rates they normally charge as not much for my wee boy bit would be happy to if he was older.
