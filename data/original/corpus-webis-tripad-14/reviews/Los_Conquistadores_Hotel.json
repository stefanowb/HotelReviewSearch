The hotel tends to cater to tour groups, which also creates a very friendly atmosphere, and it's right in the center of town, but the rooms have no noise problems. And the rooms themselves are huge -- a little dilapidated, a touch on the kitschy side, and hairdryers need to be specially requested, but otherwise very comfortable.
