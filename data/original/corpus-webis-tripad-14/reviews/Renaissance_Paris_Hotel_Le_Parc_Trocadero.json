I have been a Marriott guy since 1999 and have stayed at many of their upscale properties (and some small Fairfield Inns in the middle of nowhere). When I was deciding to go to Paris, it was between this hotel and a few others. I had stayed in the Trocadero area before at another hotel chain and loved the area for its neighborhood feel. I dismissed the Champs Elysse and Arc de Triomphe hotels as they were in touristy areas and would be loud. Walking past the Champs Elysse hotel during my last visit, I noticed how busy everything around it was. So, I looked at this hotel and the Vendrome location. The 'boutique' word used in so many reviews made me think 'small rooms' so I opted for the Trocadero Rennaissance location. From the minute we arrived we were treated like special guests. All the staff was very friendly. The hotel itself is quiet and upscale but close enough to the action. Its a 5 minute walk to the Victor Hugo Metro stop and a 5 to 7 minute walk to the Trocadero Metro stop and an awesome view of the Effiel Tower. There are many little bistros along the way and a small grocer within a block. There is a bigger grocery store near the Victor Hugo metro station. We stayed in the annex of the hotel which required us to walk through the amazing courtyard every day. If it was warmer out, we woulod have bought a bottle of wine and relaxed there.The room was big for European standards, so was the bathroom. A lot of detail went into the room. The room had a fridge, safe, nice TV with one or two English news stations, and robes.Turndown service leaves mini Tolberones! Since I was a Gold Level Marriott person, we got free breakfast and internet. The breakfast would have been about $80 US for two of us! The food was great and so was the service. Lots to choose from.
