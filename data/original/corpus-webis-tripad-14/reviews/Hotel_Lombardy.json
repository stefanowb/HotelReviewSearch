It's a short walk i.e. less than 10mins from Foggy-Bottom and no problems finding it. The hotel was small by US standards, the rooms was very comfortable. We found all the staff were friendly and the food was very good, we had dinner and breakfast both very enjoyable, good quality and reasonably priced. I would recommend a room on the upper floors due to the aircon units outside of the building. I would recommend eating at The Elephant & Castle great atmosphere and the Founding Farmers for the best eggs benedicts!

We took a r a quick city trip from New York by train for the MLK 50th March on Washington. I liked the \"boutiqueness\" of the hotel (converted small one-bedroom apartments); staff was okay -- basically stayed their distance but responded well to requests; liked that the windows opened and the supposed \"kitchette\" -- which it is not -- but served us well as a small bar. I did not like (a) the view -- an empty building construction site adjacent to the hotel -- not good. The bed was okay but would agree with a previous reviewer that it was a little \"hard for my taste\". The location was okay but we took taxis everywhere. Went down to the bar and did not get a good reception. The bartender said they were closing although it was several people still sitting at the bar drinking at 10:30 pm (I think he was just ready to go home). Ate out all the time so can't comment on the restaurant, although I never smelled it tempting aromas coming out of it. Tip: For great food and atmosphere, try Georgia Brown's -- a 8-10 minute taxi ride down the street.
