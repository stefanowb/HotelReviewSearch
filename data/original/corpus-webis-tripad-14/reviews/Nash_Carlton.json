The hotel door is a hundred feet from the Metro, which takes you up and down the backbone of the city for free. The management was very kind and didn't charge me for a day when I mis-booked, which I appreciated no end. I was a bit hesitant to book because of the mixed reviews, but found nothing lacking in our stay. . .except the bed. Hard as a rock. If you like a hard bed you're in luck.
