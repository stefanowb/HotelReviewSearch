Get a room at the front for a great view of the square out front (although they can be noisy), as the rooms at the back have no view and you will have to keep the blinds closed since some of the windows face the lifts. You wont be sleeping early anyhow, the city is buzzing at midnight. Rooms dont have door latches so watch out for housekeeping bursting in at 8am despite your do not disturb signs.

After a brief misunderstood related with the reservation, that was quickly solved and in the best way, we had a wonderful stay with all the confort that a nice, big enough suite with a view to the Square can provide. We also have dinner in the hotel, which I highly recommend for its quality and service -which is not so frequent in Barcelona.

Only word of warning (and why the room rating only got a 'good' ) is because our room had a big, fat, POST right in front of the sink/counter in the bathroom!
