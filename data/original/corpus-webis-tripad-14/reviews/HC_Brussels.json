Staff was friendly, breakfast was basic but filling, rooms were clean, and the bathrooms were HUGE (loved the towel warmer!). This hotel is on the outskirts of the city center, but not a far tram ride, and in nice weather it's not a bad walk (from the Musee de Beaux Arts it took me about 45 minutes to walk back to the hotel).

I stayed at the Catalonia Forum during a Cosmos Trip to Europe. Overall, I have to say I was pretty disapointed in the hotel. Rooms were small, dirty and smelly. The walls in the hotel room had all kinds of stuff on them. Elevator was terribly small as well. The plusses on this place were, that though it's in a BAD part of town, there were plenty of restaurants to eat at nearby, huge very nice bathroom and the staff was very friendly and accomidating. If your only staying at this hotel for 1 day, go for it. but if you're staying there more, I'd pick some place else. I just felt it was very small, dirty and felt very unsafe at this place. If you have any questions about this hotel or Cosmos vacations, I'd be happy to answer them. Email me: SaraM1976@aol.com. Thanks!
