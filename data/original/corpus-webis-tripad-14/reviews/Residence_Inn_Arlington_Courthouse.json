Perfect location right by the metro so easy to commute to places. The lobby was very nice with a fireplace and a sitting area. Breakfast was a hot breakfast with a lot of variety in the mornings. The room was a suite style with a living area and full kitchenette. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom had granite countertops. The couch in the sitting area was a pull out sleeper sofa so the room would be perfect if traveling with kids. Restaurants all around within walking distance. The property looks like it is a newer property- no signs of wear anywhere that I saw. Very clean. They must allow pets as I saw a couple of people with their dog going on the elevator.", "title": "Loved the location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "clmtraveler", "date": "July 6, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115104333}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "All four of us enjoyed our stay at this hotel in a 1 bedroom king suite with a pull out sofa. The sofa bed was so-so, while the king bed was much more confortable. The room was clean and large enough for our group. The kitchen was great for heating up leftovers and storing food/drink. We always had enough towels for the bathroom and liked that the sink was separate from the shower/toilet. We couldn't figure out the cooling system in the room...it was downright cold below 73 degrees, but upon turning the system up to 74 degrees, the heater came on! We called maintenance once to address the loose handle on the toilet and they fixed it promptly. We ate at the complimentary breakfast buffet most mornings during our 4 night stay which is a plus when on a budget. My son utilized the indoor pool twice during downtime from the day's activities. There are countless restaurants, coffee spots, and shops within walking distance of the hotel. As others have stated, the metro is close to the hotel for our main form of transportation into DC...short ride to all tourist areas. We even took the metro from DCA to the Courthouse metro station...easy and less than a taxi ride to get to the hotel. Finally, the hotel staff was friendly and always willing to give us suggestions on area restaurants or anything else we requested. Overall, a quality hotel in a great area just outside of DC!", "title": "Quality hotel close to DC sites", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mugabi", "date": "July 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115065590}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "After seeing the prices for two rooms in DC, we chose to get the two-bedroom suite at the Residence Inn in Arlington instead. One king bed in a private bedroom with bathroom, one queen bed in a private bedroom with bathroom, then a pull-out sofa. The sofa also has a large one piece cushion - my 20 year old sons used the sofa and the cushion and let their sister have the queen bedroom. Small four seat dining table with ethernet at the edge for the computers. Wi-fi was spotty so it was great having the ethernet.

We had a suite with 2 brms and small kitchenette, living room area. It is hard to put my finger on why I did not like this place much, afterall included is: free breakfasts, good gym, pool, clean laundry room, etc. But somehow it is missing something; it felt impersonal, decor is like walking into Marshals store, there are free meals 2-3 times a week which I found almost inedible- overcooked, tasteless mass produced gruel. The breakfast is fine but little variation from week to week. The location is good near metro, restaurants and movies. Staff were also friendly and professional.
