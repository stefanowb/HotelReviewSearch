The lobby is a row of computers which makes it feel impersonal. That being said, it was clean and a good value for the proximity to Times Square.

However, once we were there we decided to upgrade to a corner room which was $50.00 + tax a night. Considering the views in NYC it was well worth the extra $ in my opinion. The men standing in the lobby were very nice in letting us know that in order to upgrade we needed to go to the fourth floor, speak to \"mission control\", and they would take care of it. I do recommend upgrading your room before you arrive because we did get the last corner room available. I believe these rooms are also slightly larger. There was a closet area with space to hang clothes, two drawers, plenty of room under the bed for large suitcases, iron, ironing board, safe, small hair dryer, and small toilietries such as tissues, and disability access. There is a TV, desk, IPod dock, automatic blinds, and plenty of shelves to make for storage. I never really had any issues with the hotel, but here are some things that others may potentially find annoying. Corner rooms are located right next to the \"Galley\" where you will find the free coffee, water, fridge, microwave, and ice. Good because I slipped by for my morning cup in my PJ's a couple of times. Bad, because like many others have said, you can hear the door slamming shut time after time as people are going in and out. If you are a light sleeper this may be really bad for you. The bed is super hard and I would say it has less cushion than a futon. I was always sooo tired from the streets of NY that it never bothered me, but anyone with back issues would never make it. The bathroom had two issues. I read about a curtain covering the restroom, which was not the case for corner rooms. We had no curtains seperating us, just the clear sliding door. I have been in some not so private bathrooms in my time traveling, but this was the worst. This door does not have any frost at all, it is completely see through, and has a small dotted design at the bottom, which does nothing privacy wise. I just can't understand this concept of hotels and why they think it is desirable to watch someone else go to the restroom. Just be warned that the door is clear and you can see through it. The other thing with the bathroom was the draining of the shower. We had to put down at least two towels to keep from getting water all over the floor and into the carpet. I believe this causes huge problems with mold because I am allergic to it and felt very symptomatic while there. The first morning we got out fairly late around 1:00 PM and when we returned around 8:00 PM our room was not clean (the only time this happened for 5 nights), but around 30 mins later we got a call from mission control that when they came by that we had our \"do not disturb\" sign on and they were unable to clean the room and asked if we needed any extra towels or anything else they could help us with, which I thought was a nice touch.", "title": "Corner room review", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "joscelyngo39", "date": "March 19, 2012", "detail_rating": {"location": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 126352197}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with family", "text": "On the fourth floor you will find two bars. We did hang out for two drinks on a Sat around 7 and the bar was fairly busy. We had no problem getting a drink and they are pricey like every other bar in Manhatten. There is an outdoor area rooftop as well, which we never used because of the weather, but would be great in the summer. The area they turn into a night club atmosphere at night is also on four. We passed by several times, but never went in because I am not a huge fan of techno which it seemed that they only played. Dohyo is also located on four, they supply the free muffins from 7-10AM there, there are several computers to use free of charge, and a concierge. \"Yobot\" is located in the lobby when you first walk in, but be aware that it can NOT store all luggage. Luckily one of the doormen told us our bags were too big and he was kind enough to store them for us, and arrange for a taxi once it was our time to leave. Yotel also has there own car service that they use where you can ride in a black town car or escalade for an upgrade charge if you want to ride VIP.

Subway and bus stations are all really close by. There are a lot of food options all around. Broadway shows are within walking distance. We are walkers and we were able to walk to Rockefeller Plaza, Fifth Ave, Grand Central Station, and Central Park from the hotel with no problem.

We walked to the theater, subway, Times Square, etc. The group all stated they would return to the Yotel. Although the hotel advertised the rooms were compact--they were excellent. The features that were new to us, no check in desk, the beds, made the experiences even more fun! We thought we were the only ones in the Yotel--so quiet.
