It was in the \"newer\" section that links the old building with the health club. This part of the hotel has seen better days. The room itself was clean but a bit shabby and is quite a bit different to the \"feature\" rooms that you see on the website that have old oak beams. The bed was also just two twins joined together and not really very comfortable. Plus side was that the room was close to the health club which has a good pool and steam room.", "title": "Superb service but smoky and shabby", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JayneAndD", "date": "March 4, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6910915, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great food, location and service", "disliked": "\u2014 Smoky and the rooms are a little shabby"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Having said all that, the food here was excellent, We had both dinner and breakfast and the service was superb.

I am just in the process of booking our 2008 holiday and I have just asked my 8 year old son where he wants to go. \" the Dower House \" he said and this was a child who has travelled the world, not quite the answer I expected having given him choices of places we had been before ie; Barbados, Antigua. Maldives, Mexico etc etc etc. The room we stayed in on our last visit was definately the best. It was a little suite away from the main hotel. The staff in the leisure centre were brilliant and discussed the comprtitors in strictly come dancing which is a subject close to my heart.
