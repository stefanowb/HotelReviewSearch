The location is pretty good, not perfect, since you're about a 15 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio and the Galleria Uffizi, but then again, Florence is very walkable and nothing is too far.

We found it to be a perfect place to start our trip. The staff was extremely helpful from check-in to checkout. In fact, our best dinner that we had in Italy was at a place recommended by the woman working the desk (Mama Gina's...very good). Our room was very clean and spacious. It was at the back of the hotel, which was fortunate since (as many other reviewers have mentioned) there was music in the piazza outside the hotel during the evening. The music usually lasted until around midnight. We thought it was cool to have a concert outside our front door. I'm sure if we had a room in the front of the hotel, we would have had a different opinion, though. The breakfast was decent. It consisted of the standard fare - bread, fruit, ham, cheeses, cereal, coffee, etc. As some others have mentioned, the bed was pretty hard. They were like that in every place that we stayed throughout Italy. If you want a soft bed, you're better off at a Westin or Sheraton. The only issue we had was at checkout. I was almost overcharged for the room. Fortunately, I had my email confirmation with me and was able to confirm the correct price with the staff.

No such luck on this trip! The piazza has definitely gone downhill in attracting a seedy bunch of people who lounge on the steps and stagger around the piazza at night. The staff was not friendly this time and our room was unacceptable. The bed was like sleeping on plywood and the worst part was a horrible smell (like a backed up sewer or toilet) that permeated our room the second morning we were there. While the location is great, we will NOT go back. I think the management has not done a good job with keeping the place up to date - everything is tired and worn looking.
