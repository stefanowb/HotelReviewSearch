I called and emailed them to see if we could be put on a lower floor because we had someone with limited mobility and there is no elevator. They kindly responded that we were written in for the 2nd floor. When we tryed to check in we were on the 3rd floor in a 8 bed ensuite with 2 strangers in the room with us. They would not fix this so we left with a refund on our credit card---paid in cash but they would not give cash back. We booked online and I am sure we will not get our 8 dollar deposit back from the booker. The front desk told us that they cant help it if the booker online has the wrong info on the rooms..and that they dont even have 6 bed rooms. This is unacceptable..they are the ones who contract with the bookers.", "title": "THEY GAVE OUR ROOM TO SOMEONE ELSE", "user": "shell43", "date": "December 14, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0}, "id": 89827083}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Although this hotel is not in the hussle and bussle of the city of new york, it is in a very pleasant location just a few blocks from Central Park.", "title": "Very nice Hotel", "user": "Camacho87", "date": "November 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 87907308}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "The hotel is clean, average sized room (we booked double) with a clean ensuite shower.
