I can\u2019t speak for the condition of all the rooms as I only saw two, and, though basic, these were okay by the rather low S\u2019ville standards. Also, the location is not at all bad \u2013 near enough to easily access the popular beach area, but far enough away to give a sense of calm. But the other complaints \u2013 little comparable value for money, disinterested service, insufficient attention to room cleanliness, the seemingly deliberate ploy to disguise the \u201ctax\u201d \u2013 are all valid. On top of these, the establishment chose to reduce their room rates during my stay \u2013 after I had indicated the intention to remain for a few days \u2013 though lacked the courtesy to offer the reduction for my remaining stay, or even to provide an explanation. One other unique feature of the Deva Raja is the \u201cmanagement responses\u201d to reviewer criticism - that end up attacking the reviewers themselves!", "title": "Overpriced, messy and unwelcoming.
