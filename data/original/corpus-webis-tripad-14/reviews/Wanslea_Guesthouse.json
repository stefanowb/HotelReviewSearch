It was okay. Not great, not bad. I think the reviewers on here must have met someone else, because I was expecting a warm & friendly owner (based on previous reviews) but he was okay. One thing I must mention is that the parking is minimal. If you arrive between 4:00pm - 6:00pm you'll have to park somewhere else as the owner goes out and his son refuses to move his car so you, as a guest(!) can park your own. All in all, I probably wouldn't stay here again. Not because it was dire, just that it is no better, or worse than most other B&B's around.

Stayed in Arabian and African themed rooms which were really well furnished and decorated and always cleaned to a very high standard. The bathrooms were also lovely with spa bath to soak those aching muscles after a long walk (great for me at 8 months pregnant!!). Really handy location for the town and great walks! Richard the owner was extremely helpful and even lent us maps for our walks and told us good places to go walking and eat out at night.
