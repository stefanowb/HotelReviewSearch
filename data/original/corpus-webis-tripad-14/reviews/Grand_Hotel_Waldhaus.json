It is a large but excellent hotel with a wide choice of rooms to suit your budget and needs. The food is good and the staff helpful. You do need a bus to get to the slopes but the hotel has their own that runs regularly. The best thing about it is for the non-skiers. This hotel has indoor tennis courts and a fabulous spa area.", "title": "Amazing hotel", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "August 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3792038}], "location": {"country": "Switzerland", "region": "Swiss Alps", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 4, "very good": 24, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 81}, "aka": "Waldhaus Flims, Mountain Resort And Spa", "slim_ranking": 0.0625, "description": "In the biggest hotel park in Switzerland, a unique variety of offering await you \u2013 for summer and ski vacations with family and friends or simply for a quiet weekend for two.
