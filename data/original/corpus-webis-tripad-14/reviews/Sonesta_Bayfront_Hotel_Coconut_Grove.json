We had family and friends who had been disapointed in Miami before by second rate hotels that were billed as classy and expensive online. So on our first trip to Miami we didn't know what to expect. What we found in the Sonesta was a very nice, low-key and friendly place. We had reserved a Bay-View King room, but when we arrived at our room the door locking mechanism wouldn't lock. With a single phone call to the front desk a maintenance person responded immediately. When he found he couldn't fix the problem quickly, the hotel moved us to a wonderful suite that looked over the bay. The rooms were simple, elegant and comfortable. The staff was always friendly and more than willing to help with any requests. I personally enjoyed sangria night at the poolside bar- very nice! The hotel was close to everything, specifically a Starbucks just a half a block down- I have to have my coffee in the morning. The valet parking was totally worth the extra money- it was secure and much less stressful than trying to find a parking space. For the rate that we paid (under $100 on an internet site) I was more than impressed. Also, the concierge Chaz was super friendly- he gave a lot of good info. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definately stay there again if back in Miami.", "title": "A Nice Surprise!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "travelgirl4321", "date": "October 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5905896, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Elegant and comfortable rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Trust guest reviews over flashy website photos!!!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "From my experience, most hotels would usually give you a better deal if you call them direct which we did and got the parking package for one night at $169 (with taxes, etc. it ended up costing $189).
