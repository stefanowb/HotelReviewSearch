These busses run quite regularly. In mid October they came along every 10 minutes or so. To complement this, the town of Springdale has also created a free shuttle service that runs from the West park entrance, down the main street to the end of town with plenty of stops along the way. So, as long as your motel is along the main drag of Springdale, proximity to the park entrance is not a serious factor. Of course if you're at the far end of town you may need to ride the shuttle bus 5 or 10 minutes longer - not a big deal.
