If no tables avail, there is a gate that goes to restaurant and that is hidden but nice a peaceful. And breakfast is free and lots of varietys to choose.

The waterfall is great backdrop. You can't beat the managers reception in the afternoon with free liquor and snacks. The rooms are normal two-room suite with the micro fridge , all HD TV that ask for room facing the east above 8th floor, It's so cool to be over to watch the cruiseships, Largest cruise ship in the world actually docks at Ft. Lauderdale. There is a grocery store on each side of the hotel there's also shopping ,Ross ,dollar tree , cvs, SCUBA shop And a lot of different restaurants to choose from both sit down and fast food are within walking distance I do recommend Chuck's steakhouse though very tasty within walking distance. If you're looking for activities to do, rental car, Everglades excursion... anything you can imagine Linda the concierge is amazing at finding you good deals on all that stuff.

We arrived in the late morning one day prior to our cruise and were allowed to go right to our rooms. We love the roominess offered by the hotel. Rooms were clean, very spacious (sink, mini-fridge and coffee-maker in room) with very comfortable bedding and two flat screen TVs: one in bedroom and one in sitting area (which offers a large writing desk, comfortable sofa and a few chairs. Make sure you take advantage of the Manager's Cocktail hour. Offered to all guests from around 5:30 - 7:30? p.m. Guests may order any type of wine or cocktail and can help themselves to \"munchies:\" salsa and chips, popcorn, pretzels, etc. Breakfast is outstanding - made to order omelets, fresh fruits, juices, coffee, danish, etc. We also sat by the pool in the afternoon and it seemed that a lot of guests used the pool. There is a nice area to just relax and read and/or enjoy something to drink. The hotel is very attractive with a beautiful lobby and atrium. We took a van (offered right at the door) from the hotel to the seaport (less than two miles away). Convenience, comfort and an affordable price. We will return to this hotel the next time we cruise from Fort Lauderdale. An extra tip: If you'd like to enjoy a great burger - try Gilbert's 17th Street Grill in the HarborShops located just behind the hotel. See TripAdvisor reviews. Also, if you are allowed to carry wine onto your ship, there is a Total Wines (as well as a great supermarket) in the same shopping center.", "title": "Great Hotel", "user": "Hayes39", "date": "April 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157619545}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Stayed here 2days before cruise .Rooms cleanish found a few things under the bed ,bed on the small size a small Queen .

If you are trying to check in, as we were, on a cruise day it is pandemonium. The staff does a great job, but trying to check in at noon and already having 72 people ahead waiting was quite a surprise. Nevertheless, the staff is very good and the pool area very nice as well as all the standard Embassy Suite advantages (reception, breakfast, etc.). The worst thing about this hotel: the internet in the business center or kiosk. It was slower than the first dial up connection I ever had (no kidding). It is soooo frustrating when it takes 20-30 minutes to finally get through a flight check in process only for the connection not to be strong enough to trigger the wireless printer.
