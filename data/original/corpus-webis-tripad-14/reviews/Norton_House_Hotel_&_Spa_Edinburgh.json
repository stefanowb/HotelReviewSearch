Everyone was delighted with their bedrooms and loved the beautiful views. I even got a helper who waited on me while we got the photos taken, she went and got me some champagne which was the best thing anyone could have offered me! During the meal and the speeches our Duty Manager, Callum Briggs, was on hand to ensure that they whole event ran smoothly. Despite the fact that our speeches ran over, he was endlessly patient and somehow managed to have a smile on his face throughout.
