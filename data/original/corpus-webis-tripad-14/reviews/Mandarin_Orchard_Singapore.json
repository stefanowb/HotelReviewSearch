You know what impressed me though was the telephonist who put me thru to housekeeping rang me back to make sure said towels were delivered and was there anything else that could be done! I thought that was a really nice touch. It is a very busy hotel probably because it is in such a central location near all the cool shopping locations.

But as I was travelling in the lift a manager (I think), a very nice man,Mr Ryan ? Kwoek (sorry if I misspelt) asked what I was doing that day and I said I was checking out and he asked what time my flight was and I replied not till 10.30 that night and I was unable to get a late checkout, that I was going to leave my bags at reception and do a bit more shopping if I could squeeze any more into my bags! And probably go to a movie or something just to kill time until my airport pickup at around 7 pm. He told me to use his name and come back around 5.30 or 6pm and ask for a hospitality room so I could shower and freshen up before my flight. What a difference that made to me. I felt so much better after that shower knowing I had at least a 7 hour flight back to the Gold Coast. I would highly recommend staying at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel.
