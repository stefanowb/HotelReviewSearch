The campfire was going and the wind was blowing off the lake making for a great sunset. Before bed we went to the lounge/bar and got a yummy drink called The Quinault Steamer. We sat there in the lobby and reflected on all we had seen that day. We ate breakfast in the Roosevelt dining room and it was good but the service was very slow. My only complaint was there was no plug in the bathroom to use the hair dryer.
