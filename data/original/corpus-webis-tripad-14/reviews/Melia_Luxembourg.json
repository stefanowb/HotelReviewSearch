The MUDAM and brand new \"Three Acorns\" museum are right next door. Some might find it to be too far of a walk from the city's centre (approximately 15 minutes), but we ended up enjoying being a little ways away from the hustle and bustle.

The front desk was efficient and most helpful whenever we approached them for directions, etc. Our room was quite large and ery quiet at night and the bed was most comfortable. The room also had more than adequate lighting for reading at night, something many hotel rooms lack. The bathroom was done in marble and was also quite large. Now we did stay on the executive floor, which wasn't that much more but if I recall correctly, wifi was included on that floor. Every afternoon, the hotel served complementary wine and appetizers in the lobby and the outside patio which was lovely. I should say that these weren't just nuts and crackers but were quite elaborate hot and cold appetizers which were served buffet style. There was a nice assortment of wines to choose from and all of this was complementary to all hotel guests. At least I assume so since no one asked for our room number. Breakfast was served in a lovely airy dining room on the second floor and included a wondrous array of first rate breakfast items as well as specialties created for the day. One of the nicest breakfasts of our trip.

Wonderful to view and photograph. We did discover that it is too far to walk to any part of the old city so we hailed a cab partway down the hill and had a typically expensive drive for a prosperous European city. While downtown, we discovered that there existed the Hop on Hop off Bus, which we always take wherever we find it's available. We had a great ride, getting off at all the high spots we wanted to see as well as the shopping area. Weren't we thrilled to find out that one of the stops was outside our hotel! I must admit that I almost didn't book this hotel because of its exterior in the online photograph. It looks like a large ugly box that has an exterior made of some kind of roughed up material. Well I can say that it does look much better in person but it should look much better in person than it does. Some architect got a bit carried away with nouveau exteriors.
