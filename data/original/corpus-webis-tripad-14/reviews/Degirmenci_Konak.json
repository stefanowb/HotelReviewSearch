Would like to thank the very kind lady owner again for the wonderful stay. There are two things I may wish to bring to future visitors' notice: 1. if you are taking long-distance bus to Safranbolu, just take a taxi direct from Safranbolu Octagor to this house. The fare should be no more than 15TL by meter and it saves you a lot of time finding the place. Free dolmus provided by bus companies will not drop you there. You will waste time orientating. 2. Walk to town centre is okay, downhill and takes around 15 minutes in leisure. The return however is not that easy. You may get lost if you are not careful as you will find that all houses look the same. My suggestion is actually to take a taxi (10TL fixed price) to save the hassle.", "title": "Exceptional host in a beautiful mansion", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JJB", "date": "May 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 129632634}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "It is in very quite location and interior design is an original Safranbolu mansion.

The building itsself is truly beautiful and the hosts Ahmet and his wife were the friendliest and most welcoming that we encountered duruing our 5 week stay in Turkey. The house is a short interesting walk from the old town and we realise tha it is very very easy to return by dolumus. Ahmet explained the history of the house and its renovation and showed us some amazing photogarphs of the surrounding area that we alas did not have time to visit. The restaurant that he recommended was also a highlight os our trip. On our return from dinner, we had tea and freshly made cake whilst sitting in bean bags in the lovely garden, looking at the clear clear stars and breakfast the next morning was just as delicious. Because we had to catch a bus Ahmet kindly offerred to drive us to the the otogar but, before he did so he took us on tour of the town and showed us all of the interesting sites that we did not have time to visit. Next year we are planning to return to Tutkey and Safranbolu and the Degirmenci Konak are on the top of the list and this time for more than one night.
