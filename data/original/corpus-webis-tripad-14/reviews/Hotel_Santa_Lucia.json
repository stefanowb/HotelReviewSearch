It was one of the smartest and cleanest hotels we have stayed in in France, even down to the modern double glazing, airconditioning, spotless bathroom, hot tub facility in the patio area (!) and flatscreen TV. The staff were always helpful, attentive and smiling. There was a good variety of fresh fruit salad, cold meats, egg, cheese, etc., besides the usual fare in the French buffet breakfast (nice to have it included in the deal). We could leave our hire car in the hotel car park behind the security gates, again with no extra payment.", "title": "As good as we hoped it would be", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JohnGilmour", "date": "March 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 26098009}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "As stated in previous reviews, tihs is a lovely small hotel.

However the Marina has a good choice of bars and restaurants and is only ten minutes away on foot. It is a lovely small hotel with very friendly staff. It is immaculate inside and out. There is a small courtyard and a separate area with a Jacuzzi and sun loungers. It is very private and extra towels are provided for free. The rooms are individually decorated with themes from different countries but they are quite small and the bathrooms are also compact. There are hairdryers a safe and a kettle (ask at reception for milk). The breakfasts are good with choices of cereal meats cheeses and fruit as well as a delicious choice of pastries. There is free internet access in reception. They will serve you a drink at any time of day to drink outside or in the small lounge.
