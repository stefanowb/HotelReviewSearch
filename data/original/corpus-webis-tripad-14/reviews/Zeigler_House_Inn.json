I list it as one of 'THE BEST' B&B's we have stayed at. Jackie goes out of her way to make sure your visit is the best. She is there to assist you with any information you need and has good recommendations for restaurants, whether you're looking for where the locals like to go or want a touristy place. She goes a big extra yard to make your stay comfortable with fresh flowers throughout the room, candies, a stocked refrigerator with juice, water, soft drinks, yogurt and english muffins. The fresh pastries she brings on a daily basis are very good. The private porch is so nice and even if it rains, as it did when we were there, you can still sit outside because it is covered. It is very clean and she even goes as far as supplying decent toilet paper instead of the ruff commercial kind you usually get. Jackie even offers wine and snacks in the main house on Fridays and Saturdays where you can stay and enjoy or go to the main porch and sit. Unlike some B&B's where the owners are always in your face, Jackie is there to help make your stay as memorable as possible but not to bother you. As she says, 'If you need me for anything just call my cell and I'll be there.' The location is also great. It is away from the hustle of tourists so it's very quiet but just a short walk to everything. We highly recommend this place if you are planning a trip to Savannah. We will definitely stay there again when we go back.", "title": "Fantastic Place", "user": "Butcher.T", "date": "April 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14957167, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the friendliness of the innkeeper and all the extra touches she adds to make you stay pleasurable"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I enjoyed a delightful 5 nights at the Zeigler House Inn in March 2008.
