The suite I had included a kitchen with a full-sized refrigerator, microwave oven, dishwasher, sink and cabinets --- no stove. However, there were no plates, pots or utensils. Maybe they could have been borrowed, but I never asked. The living room was decent sized and had a desk and flat screen TV with a remote controlled propane fireplace. The bathroom had shower and separate jetted tub. The sink was nice but too tall -- I had to stand on my tiptoes to rinse my face. The bedroom had a second TV and two queen beds --- but, space was tight and I banged up my leg trying to get around the bed. There was an odd little hallway at the entrance with a fairly large coat closet. A separate smaller closet was in the bedroom. Overall, quite a nice place to stretch out and relax.
