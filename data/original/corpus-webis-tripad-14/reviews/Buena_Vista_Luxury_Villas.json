We awoke at 5:45 every morning by the squirrel monkeys jumping on our roof as they made their way down the mountain. They would always stay a while in the trees just downslope of our villa and eat some of the small fruit from that stand of trees. Normally about one to two hours later, the Capuchin monkeys would come through as they made their way up the mountain. We also saw different types of colorful birds, coatis, iguanas, a Jesus Christ lizard, and a skunk. We heard howler monkeys in distance, but never saw any. We liked 303 because it was the closest to the parking lot, so it required the least grueling walk up the mountain (still not for someone that is out of shape or handicapped).
