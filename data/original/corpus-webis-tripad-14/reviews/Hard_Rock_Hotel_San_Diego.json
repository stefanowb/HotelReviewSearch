I rushed my 51 year old mother to our room ASAP because I thought I booked us the primo Gold level Rockstar Penthouse as seen on the website. The agent over the phone explained a very impressive room with balcony and jacuzzi bathtub. The pictures online looked amazing! Little did I know that each penthouse is totally different in size and the ones pictured are the largest/nicest and most expensive for each level. We get there, and they have one agent checking guests in. We waited. We checked in. Balcony was a ledge with a railing. My mom couldnt even fit on the \"balcony\". When booking the room I informed the agent that I would be taking my 51 yr. old Mom here for her birthday and I wanted to stay at the Hardrock because it was the coolest looking hotel. No one over the phone or at check in informed us that all of the Rockstar penthouses were directly above the nightclub or warned us about the noise level. So we didn't sleep. Music til 1:30 AM and drunk screaming the rest of the night. The room service guy even commented on how loud the rooms are and how many guests complain that they cant sleep in the Rockstar suites. He also literally laughed at how the rooms look nothing like they do on the websute. We checked out disapointed in the whole stay. I went to pay my credit card and I was charged twice for our room. Was also charged $130 in false minibar charges. I stay in hotels weekly and I have never ever had this happen. I was even charged for a \"pleasure kit\"...um, NO! Lucky after making a few phone calls the charges are suppose to be removed but so far hasn't reflected my credit card. Needless to say- WHAT A BUMMER. The hotel looked so cool. I did love to art and furniture. The Aveda bath products are of course a plus. But I would have traded Aveda and cool factor over sleeping and not having to be stressed out about the huge overcharge.", "title": "Stayed one night, paid for two along with $130 in false minibar charges", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "teena192", "date": "July 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 35982150}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have are San Diego locals, and have been to the Hard Rock a few times.

The hotel floors are always full of guests on party nights. People book a room hand have large groups pack in to the rooms. There are rules about how many people and limits on outside alcohol, but these are not enforced by the staff. Do not get me wrong, this place is fun, it feels like Las Vegas. It will keep you up all night. Lucky for us locals, we can just go back home and get some sleep. I did feel bad for other guests from out of town who selected this hotel for a vacation and not a bachelor party. There are much better vacation spots in the same area.

After reading some other reviews I was worried about some things but everything was great. When we first checked in we got upgraded which was really nice and the check in process was quick and easy. Our room was amazing and had an awesome balcony, we had a hard rock suite. We rented a car one day to go up to Temecula to visit some vineyards and the customer service was very helpful and got a car for us through enterprise. We thought all the staff was very helpful and told us some great places to go. We ate dinner at Donovan's one night which is a great steakhouse right next door and we went to the Marriott which there is a bar on the top floor and if there is a baseball game going on you can watch it because the bar looks down to the field. Breakfast was amazing in the hotel at Maryjane's and there are computers you can use free of charge with a printer! All restaurants, bars and shopping are all walking distance from the hotel. The San Diego Zoo is only like a 5-10min taxi ride away and the zoo was amazing. A couple of negative things about this hotel is that it is right next to the train and the train runs all night so it was noisy in the morning (but its the city so i guess we expected some noise) and there are so many taxes added to your room rate when you check out so beware on adding about $30 extra a day in taxes!!", "title": "Amazing Stay!!", "user": "lewis1226", "date": "July 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34667341}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I would deff. recommend this hotel to anyone and can't wait to go back!", "title": "A classy hotel with professional staff and great location", "user": "jaxzibit", "date": "July 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 34552896}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled on business", "text": "We stayed at the Hard Rock twice: once for 3 nights and once for 4 nights.

And whenever we drove, the valets put 2 bottles of water in our car and offered directions to wherever we wanted to go. The staff got stressed out during busy times like their summer pool party, but even then remained very accomodating and professional - while waiting for our room they allowed us to freshen up in the spa, and catered to many other requests. Their pool bar area is really well done - breezy and well appointed with couches / lamps / stools. The bartenders are friendly and know their cocktails.

Eventually found a cable in a black felt pouch behind a sex kit for sale by Hard Rock placed in each room. Charged $270 per night, plus mandatory $17 per day for phone/internet access. Multi-media system advertised, TV didn't work, phone only worked on speaker phone. Hotel so noisy I was awakened at least four times by trains, hotel is directly next to railroad tracks. My employees said drunk people going up and down halls all night doors slamming. Hotel has no parking lot for customers, told only lot around is $19 per day and won't be able to get out if a baseball game is on. Our vendor parked in a lot a couple blocks away for $3 per day. Told hotel manager of deceptive practices. He said I was incorrect, lot was not $3 per day. Then with his security team in my room trying to fix TV and phone while I am on speakerphone with him, I tell him I am holding the $3 parking ticket. He tells me I am still wrong. Then says attendent must have made an error. Then I tell him it is an automated machine, check in on 15th out on 16th for $3. Then he changes story to we can't be reponsible for what other lots charge. Really? Then your staff should say they are $19. Valet didn't even want to let us unload if we weren't going valet. Told staff TV didn't work in morning still not fixed at night. We said we were checking out a day early, were told we would have to pay anyway. I said I was told 24 hour advance notce and we could cancel, they said early checkout pays additional night. Manager Luke angered me so much we left at 10:30 PM, got back to LA 1 AM. My employee then drove home, fell asleep at wheel, hit curb on freeway, two flat tires, CHP response. Now I have to pay three nights for myself and two employees who stayed one fatigued night plus pay my employees car repairs. Fortunately my employee wasn't injured. Hotel customer relations manager Luke accused me of lying. Thinks I said we coldn't sleep just to get out of paying for third night. This is a hotel for loud drunk kids.

I was a little hesitant at first because i never stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel before. When we got there we were greeted by the valet parking attendants who were very kind and helpful throughout our whole stay. If we had any questions or concerns they would gladly help us. We walked in for check-in it was pretty fast. I didn't know what to expect because apparently someone was checking in at 530 and their room wasn't ready yet. It was barely being cleaned. I hoped that wouldn't happen to me and it didn't. We got our keys they asked us what kind of music we preffered, til this day i dont understand why they asked us this. Anyway as we went up to our room the halls were decorated with rock n roll memorabilia it was very beautiful. We get to our room, (by the way we reserved a double queen bed hard rock suit), We were so amzzed by the decoration it was very chic, a couch, a lounge chair, 2 flat screen tvs, a fully stocked mini bar with two bar chair facing a large mirror, a blacony with a mid view of the surrounding shops. I loved that we turned up the music on those flat screens as loud as we could without being reprimended for it like other hotels do. I didn't really get to see the pool and the cabanas. By the way we arrived on a Wednesday so it wasn't a big party ambience. The hotel was near walking distance from everything from coffee shops, bars, lounges, ice cream, restaurants, to cigar shops. Checkout was quick you ould check out from the guest services on the flat screen tvs. Overall it was a very good experience.
