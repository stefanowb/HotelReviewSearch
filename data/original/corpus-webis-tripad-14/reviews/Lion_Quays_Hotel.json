We stopped for a family lunch at the restaurant, and although busy we were accommodated very quickly, 5 in total. Service was quick, orders taken and mains were ordered, no starters. When they arrived, the problems started. One goats cheese meal had less goats cheese than you would get as a taster in a supermarket at the deli counter. We mentioned this to the staff who removed it and returned it to the kitchen. It came back with the comment, \"its the last piece\". An alternative was offered of Salmon which was accepted. That arrived, minus the goats cheese only to look like it has come off another plate. Really disappointing and wont return. Many others looked like they were experiencing similar experiences. We have eaten there previously and it was delicious, but you only remember your last meal and I'm afraid it will be there. Stick to real pub/restaurants for good food. Waitresses we excellent, the issue was from the kitchens. On a plus, the puddings were nice, cheese board bland", "title": "Food excellent but staff training needed", "user": "Schoolgirl", "date": "July 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 169168633}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lion Quays Restaurant", "text": "The location is delightful, the food beautifully presented and cooked.
