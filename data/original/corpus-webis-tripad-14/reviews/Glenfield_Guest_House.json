Rooms are traditionally furnished, but are clean and well maintained with excellent bedding and facilities. The owners are great - exactly the kind of people who should run B&B's - caring and interested, and apparently possessed of a kind of 6th sense for anticipating what you might need or ask. Breakfast was great too, and the home baking smelled so fantastic we wished we were staying longer to sample more of it than just the homemade toast. This was the best guest house we have stayed in for a long time, and well worth the money.
