I had seen some photo's somewhere on-line but they were obviously of the suite with a private verandah. The basic rooms are in a block so the outside space would not feel terribly intimate. The room itself was perfectly fine. If you wanted to be very picky you may say the bathroom was a little tired but perfectly clean and adequate.

We found the staff to be fed up and not very helpful (I suppose I would be if I was stuck in the middle of nowhere). Reception staff apart from Solomon, the reception manager were hopeless and totally unhelpful. The food and restaurant area was ok with a good selection.

We were so very well taken care of! 3 meals a day were included with the room charge, and the meals were outstanding--rivaling any plush hotel anywhere. They varied the buffet all you can eat menu nightly, so you never got tired. The dining room was lovely and it provided a very relaxing place to congregate every evening for dinner and every morning for breakfast. Ask for African Tea and you won't be disappointed. The safari itself was disappointing, no giraffes or zebras and the lions were scarce or hiding. Lots of hippos though in Lake Edward for up close and personal views, same with hyenas and elephants-whole herds. The room was very nice, and they sprayed well and the mosquito netting was kept up to date--no holes. My family enjoyed staying here for two nights and have fond memories. All in all a great place in Uganda to visit and relax and provide lifetime memories. oh yeh, one more thing, when you arrive, they greet you with a cool towel to wipe your brow, and a cool shrub (mixed juices)just what was needed. In the morning before your safari you gather for English Tea in nice china cups and the gift shop is very nice and not overly priced!
