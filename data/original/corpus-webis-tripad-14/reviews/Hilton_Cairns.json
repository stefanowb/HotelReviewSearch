My husband and I are both Hilton Honor Gold members and we used points for our stay. As we pulled up to the hotel I saw there was major construction going on next door to a condo high rise. We got to the hotel around 10am and suprisingly our room was not only ready, but they upgraded up to a junior suite. Also, they did not have our room facing the construction site. We stayed on the 8th floor which is their spa floor. All the rooms have been re done and our corner junior sweet was fabulous. It had a walk in shower and spa tub with a rainfall shower head. All the products were Aveda which is a nice touch. We had two sliding glass doors, a bose sound system and a wonderful bed with lots of pillows. My only complaint about the hotel is that they don't have a spa on site. In the room they had a flyer for a traveling massage company that would give massages in your room but there were not any prices given. The hotel is across the street from the Sofitel casino and within walking distance of the lagoon and lots of shops and restaurants. We had just spent 5 nights at the Sheraton Mirage in Port Douglas( in a Mirage lagoon room) and we felt that the room at the Hilton was 100 times better.

Any concerns I had about noisy construction work based on earlier reviews were unfounded - we saw and heard nothing in the way of building work. We stayed on the 6th floor in a double deluxe room (622), and were delighted with this, as we'd asked for a quieter room. The rooms are carpeted and well furnished but a little on the small side for anything longer than a night or two. Then again the beds are divine - soft without being saggy. The view of the harbour was lovely, but if you've been spoiled as we have by living near near one of the world's most picturesque working harbours (Newcastle), you will find it peaceful to the point of being sleepy! You can imagine then that being woken by the sound of other guests' room doors closing behind them as they leave at 6.30 and 7 am isn't ideal - but this is the Hilton, and all the doors are heavy security doors that basically can't be shut without causing a loud click that reverberates off the tiled outdoor walkways to the rooms. Que cera. I just went back to sleep. The building is older and curiously shaped - the rooms are housed in two huge ellipses which join at each end like a pair of lips, surrounding a large central open-air atrium and lift shaft. From around the third floor up, on stepping outside your room you look down onto a glass greenhouse roof. From this end of the building parrots and lorikeets coukd be seen flitting around in nearby palms in the morning. The lifts are fast and smooth, and while we didnt swim in the pool it looked great. All in all this place delivers the luxury you expect from Hilton, but with a Cairns flavour. Be aware that concierge services for car parking at $15 a day really aren't optional, as if you want to park the car yourself they will bill you $9 every time you exit the car park. Internet access is $30 a day or part thereof with no option for anything cheaper, but there are three free pc's in the business services room. I couldn't get the free wireless in the lobby to work and was told the modem could only cope with around 10 connections at any given time. This is a big hotel, so dont stay here if walking any distance is a problem for you. The least of my annoyances was that it's hard to eat economically here if you want a balanced meal - Hanuman\"s food is absolutely superb, but too dear for every night; while I wasn't overly impressed with Mondo\"s menu downstairs - they had dishes in the $15 - 20 range, but they weren't balanced unless you ordered salad too. Having said that the room service meals were huge and big enough for two moderate eaters, and the kitchen staff like everyone else were extremely obliging.
