When I return, I'll try to go at another time in the year to see the difference in weather. My husaband and I traveled for our 5th Anniversary and decided to get a room with a plunge pool. This was a PERFECT idea, especially with the few showers that were around. The pool is about 4ft deep and is just enough space for two to have very romantic days and evenings.
