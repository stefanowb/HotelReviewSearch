This three room cottage has a full kitchen with stove top, fridge, wood stove and day bed, bathroom, laundry room and a bedroom with two comfortable beds. As an alternative for birders who might choose the Portal Peak Lodge the Cottage has the advantage of a full bird feeding station (complete with Gambel's quail, roadrunners, and a whole host of other species) viewable from a shaded patio.
