We found the hotel very easily as it is very close to a metro and oly a two minute walk. The lobby was stunning and the staff throughout the stay were wonderful. I must admit I did expect breakfast to be included in this class of hotel and it was a little disappointing it wasn't considering the price of the room. The main disappointment for me was that it was \u20ac25 each extra to use the spa. My boyfriend had booked this hotel ahead of others for my birthday weekend away as we love to use a sauna after a long day of sightseeing but when we asked at reception how to get to the spa were very upset when they told us we would need to pay \u20ac50 for a sauna!!!! It just wasn't worth paying that for a quick hour spa visit, very disappointing for such a top class hotel. Other than this you can't knock the hotels staff or quality and the cocktails in the bar were also worth the money.a lovely hotel in a fantastic location.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "amy b", "date": "March 15, 2013", "id": 154694811}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Paris itself is so inviting, it is hard to stay indoors for long.

Our double room was a very good size \u2013 it is Paris after all! The hotel\u2019s art deco lobby is a gem of retro glamour with its chandeliers and plush red interiors. The Purple Bar proved to be a favourite hangout of ours, serving French wine to a soundtrack of throwback 90s hip hop music. The location was ideal, offering a great platform from which to climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe (for those of us who cannot stomach the heights of the Eiffel Tower) and to sample the beautiful macaroons at Ladur\u00e9e on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.", "title": "Ideal Base for the Sights and Delights of Paris", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Dee S", "date": "March 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154665932}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My family and I stayed here recently and the service was surprisingly amazing!

Traveling with my wife and two daughters we found the room with two double beds to suit us nicely. The hotel was formerly under the Hilton brand but in my opinion shows no signs of being operated to any reduction in standards. The staff, particularly the two different concierges that helped us, were very professional and helpful. Other reviews commented about the quality of the service and I absolutely agree. The three main issues that we experienced started with the ridiculous cost of the buffet breakfast at over $40 per person, the free Internet service was so slow it was essentially worthless and as mentioned by another review we had trouble with enough hot water, typically the shower would turn cold midway through the second person.
