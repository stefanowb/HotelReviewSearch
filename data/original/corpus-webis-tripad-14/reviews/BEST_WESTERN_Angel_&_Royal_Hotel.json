This was reported and apologies made. However, during our 4 night stay the bed was not made - just the duvet pulled across, bottom sheet not tidied. The bed was very comfortable and ornate - with a very thick layer of dust on top of the head board. With no air conditioning I tried to open the windows, eventually giving up and then having to wash my hands as they were so dirty. Free WiFi is advertised and indeed is the case, if you have plenty of time! not if you're trying to work. Impossibly slow. We dined in the Kings Room. What a lovely room - spoiled by stained carpets. Remove them and have wooden floors - so much more in keeping with the room.
