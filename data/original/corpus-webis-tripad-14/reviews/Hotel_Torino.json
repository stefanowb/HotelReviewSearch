We found the hotel located in a small touristy place, close to the beach. The hotel outside did not look promising, however inside the hotel everything was new, refurbished, clean and tidy. Hotel is some 100 metres from the beach, in pedestrian area (difficult to get to by car), offers a garage in the same street (8 EUR/day). Reception was efficient (although I think we were welcomed by the owner, other reception staff was a bit difficult to communicate in English). Rooms were totally ok, not too spacious, but clean. Comfortable beds, nice bathroom, electric shutters, in-room safe, small TV, fridge. For my taste, breakfast was poor, mostly sweets which I am not very fond of. However, dinner was superb, free buffet and choice of first and second choices (you make your choice every morning for the evening), plus desert. Restoraunt staff was excellent. Hotel provides you sunbeds and umbrellas at the nearest beach - which is nice and saves you app. 13 EUR a day for two. All in all, we did not know what to expect and we returned very pleased with our stay.", "title": "Satisfactory", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shule", "date": "July 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 34337430}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "On a recent visit to the Italian riviera, I had the opportunity to spend a couple of nights - once again - at the Hotel Torino in Diano Marina.
