Let me start by saying that this is a recent purchased hotel that used to be a small independent. If you are expecting the usually Le Meridien level of quality - beware - it is not of that calibre. It is a very standard clean enough 3 star hotel. The staff are very polite and friendly, and will help you in English or in French. The rooms are actually slightly larger than the normal hotel room. They are slightly dated but nevertheless are kept up pretty good. The hotel offers found what they call \"high speed\" wireless internet. The internet speed is SLOW. I also checked with my colleague in another room and he found it so slow that he asked for his money back after 5 minutes of frustration. The bathrooms are poorly lit with only one tiny little soap in the bathroom. Hallways are tiny and rather cramped. If you can get a great rate at this hotel and you are not a business traveller, you may find this okay. Otherwise, I think I might want to look around.", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "galileocan", "date": "February 17, 2005", "id": 3205825}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Surprisingly, very nice and cozy!", "text": "I usually stay elsewhere during my somewhat frequent trips to Montreal.

The room we were given was on the penthouse floor and had a lovely view of the city, and was spacious and well-appointed. The bathroom was more than adequate and the monogrammed Frette bathrobes put there for guest use were a nice touch. The hotel itself had a very European feel--it is much smaller than most of the other hotels in that area--and the service we received was very good, from the doorman hailing our cabs to the concierge arranging a late check-out for us. Restaurant Bronte, which is attached (very unobtrusively) to the hotel, was a nice place to have a drink--trendy, but low-key--and their menu appeared to be on par with some of Montreal's other \"hot\" restaurants, like Area and Cube. The only small drawback to this hotel was its location--to get anywhere outside of the \"Golden Square Mile\" one has to take a taxi or the Metro (there's a station just down the street). Within walking distance are many good shops and restaurants, though, as well as the scenic main campus of McGill University. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to other travelers, especially if you get the amazing rate we found ($140 CAD/night) online.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "christianneanastasia", "date": "October 13, 2003", "id": 1386010}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Ask for a fireplace", "text": "The staff at the Hotel Versailles are first rate.
