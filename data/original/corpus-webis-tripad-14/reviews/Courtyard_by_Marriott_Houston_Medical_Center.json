Even though the one on Fannin Street is fancier, I actually prefer this Courtyard Marriott more because the internet speed is so much faster. For business purposes and for work that needs to be done at the hotel, this was a better option for me. I think the business of the Fannin Marriott caused the internet speeds to be a little slower.

What makes it so special is the outstanding customer service. Going to MD Anderson (as many guests are) can be very stressful. The front desk staff and especially Anna know that fact and are as kind and personable as they are professional and helpful. Male shuttle driver Stacey motherly suggested I bring a sweater, as the hospital can be as cold as Houston is hot. The shuttle not only provides service to the various hospitals, but to a five mile area that includes shopping and restaurants, making a rental car unnecessary.
