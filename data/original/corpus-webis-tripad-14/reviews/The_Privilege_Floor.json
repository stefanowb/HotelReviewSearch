The two representatives who took such good care of us, Alex and Kim, were professional, enthusiastic, and extremely helpful. They assured us that every detail would be right. Our driver, Sinai, was equally professional and charming. Say in the lounge was delightful, and the two young ladies who provided the massage were amazing.

Free use of a cellphone for all your local calls, your own personal transport - you get your own driver and a car (not a tuktuk) to travel around Siem reap (this also includes the temples, btw, so you only need to pay for the guide), free laundry service (if you go quadbiking, which I really recommend, this is absolutely neccessary), free happy hour (and I'm talking cocktails + munchies)... and the breakfast was awesome. I don't recommend eating up on the 4th floor (not that it was bad), just that the 1st floor has a massive breakfast spread. and most of it was delicious, especially the pho.
