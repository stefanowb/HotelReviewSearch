As other posters have written, the view of Minas Basin is terrific --the difference between high and low tide is amazing. The motel sits atop a small bluff about 30 feet above the shoreline. It was very relaxing to simply sit and take in the beauty that others have described. We booked one of the two larger end units that included the sitting area - definitey worth the extra $20. The owners are super -- so friendly and helpful, without being overbearing. I also thought the overall cleanliness was good. The downside to the motel, in my opinion, is that it is very \"tired,\" meaning that the motel itself is somewhat outdated. Our beds in particular were very uncomfortable. The mattress was very squeaky and reminded me of the old box spring mattresses in a college dorm. No amenities except for a tiny bar of soap - so be sure to bring your own shampoo and hair dryer. I would describe the experience as \"high end camping.\" Yet for all these negatives, I would probably stay there again. There is something charming about the place, so if you book there with these understandings, you'll not be disappointed. While there, be sure to visit the Grand Pre Historic Site -- well worth it.
