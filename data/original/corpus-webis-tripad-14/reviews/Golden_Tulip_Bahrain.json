My first inkling of a problem was when I opened the door to my room and smelled a very musty odor. The carpet was worn and dirty, and the lampshades were so old and brittle that they were barely attached to their frames. In fact, there wasn't much holding them together.

Internet service is typically expensive, but more inconvenient that anywhere else I have been. In order to get access to the Internet, you first have to go to the Business Center to buy time, and the center is open only during \"business hours\". If, during off hours, you need to buy more time, you can't get access until the next day when you buy another ticket.
