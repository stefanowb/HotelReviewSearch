The place is very deceptive, with lovely castle decorations in the entry. After that it is all downhill from there. In 17 days of a long trip, this one night stay was our worst nights sleep. Everything echoes (there is no soundproofing, the walls are thin), we were woken up by late night sounds of people and cars and things, no ventilation in the room and the woman at the desk told me they gave me a free upgrade. If this room was an upgrade 2'X2', I don't even want to know what the lower room looked like (I know 2 people would have never fit in a smaller room). The final offense was in the morning, I asked to buy a cup of coffee, the woman told me the coffee was $3.80 Euro, which equals 5$ in US dollars. I almost passed out, I have never paid 5$ for a cup of coffee anyplace in the world. I went down the street for a coffee 1.50 Euro.

The Glo Hotel Art in Helsinki met every need and then some. First, the staff could not have been more helpful in answering all questions, even to the point of making special changes to our room. Likewise, the delicious breakfast assortment was made ready by a cheerful, young staff who also granted any request. A smile in the morning is my favorite. The room was artfully appointed in contemporary design and furnishings - even a glass-walled shower. Location was only 4 trolly stops from the center of Helsinki, but in a quiet residential area which also had shops and restaurants. One could find anything within a 2 block radius.
