Actually we had tried to get in at two other restaurants, which were both full. We walked back to the hotel to eat there. The waiter sat us at the \"last table\" he had, except that two women came after we had been seated about 15 minutes - and a table was set for them, and they were served very promptly. The setting was lovely - we were seated outside, and we had heard the food was good. We waited for 20 minutes, no menu, no water, no waiter, try as we might - we could not get his attention - so we got up and walked down the street to another restaurant. The Hotel staff were excellent, but I wouldn't try the restaurant again.", "title": "No thank you....", "user": "WhiteMtnsFolk", "date": "October 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0}, "id": 118830289}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Provence", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 4, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 9}}
