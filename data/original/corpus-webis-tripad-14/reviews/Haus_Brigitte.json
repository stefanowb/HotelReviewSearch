This pension is not close to the lake, but most of the rooms have a clear lake view. The balcony is large and the rooms quite clean. The family running this pension was very nice and the breakfast provided by them had a homely touch. The garden outside well maintained and the lake is 8 mins walk from the pension. Would highly recommend this place as it is worth the money. (it is a bit cheaper than those closer to the lake).", "title": "Loved Haus Brigitte", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Rajiv_Anu", "date": "March 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 14423567}], "location": {"country": "Austria", "region": "Austrian Alps", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Fuschl am See"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 2, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 0.185185185185}
