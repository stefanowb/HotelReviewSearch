The hosts are wonderful: helpful yet un-intrusive. The house itself is a concoction of eclectic furnishings: from a moustache-shaped front door mat to a quirky hat display that creates the lighting in the hallway, to a range of individually decorated bedrooms, each with their own character. The food is divine, we have never tasted such quality in such a relaxed atmosphere. The location couldn't be better, equidistant from Windermere and Bowness and just a short drive, bus or boat trip to Ambleside. We also drove to Keswick and Grasmere with ease. If you are looking for a relaxed break, in a property that offers atmosphere, comfort and luxury, a class above the standard B&B, you will struggle to pick fault with this guesthouse.
