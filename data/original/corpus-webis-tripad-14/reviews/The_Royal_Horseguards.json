It is still a wonderful hotel. I enjoyed my stay there and would go back for a third visit. It is conveniently located near the River Thames, the Parliament Buildings, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace. All are very short walking distances away. And for places you cannot walk to, the Embankment Tube station is just around the corner with 4 lines that can take you anywhere in London. Don't forget to purchase an Oyster Card to ride the tube. The Oyster card is pay as you go and very convenient for travellers. If you run out of funds you simply go to a machine and top up your funds with cash or credit card. Unused funds can be refunded back to you when you finish your stay. Simply go to one of the tube stations and speak with an employee to get your unused funds back from your Oyster Card. Now back to the hotel, The hotel itself is clean, large, and staff friendly and helpful. The bed is very comfortable. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay at the Royal Horseguards.
