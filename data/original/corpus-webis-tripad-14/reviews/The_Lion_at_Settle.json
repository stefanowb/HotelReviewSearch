It's been modernised without losing the oldie worldy atmosphere. The room was large and well decorated, sadly the ensuite unit let it down, otherwise I would have rated it well above average. The staff are friendly, the place has character, the restaurant serves good food at reasonable prices. No wonder it is the busiest place in town, (and I went to them all). There are cheaper places but the convenience of being in the centre of town, especially as the weather was mixed was worth the extra.", "title": "Loved the atmosphere", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Dexter48507", "date": "November 1, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4077296}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful find", "text": "This is a wonderful old hotel nestled in the market town of Settle.
