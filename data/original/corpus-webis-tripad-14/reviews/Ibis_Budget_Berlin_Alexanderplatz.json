Conveniently there is a Kaiser's supermarket just next door which has a bakery which also serves fresh coffee. The trams stop just outside the doors of the hotel, and within walking distance are plenty of bars and restaurants and lots of Turkish food places. The hotel itself is modern and spotlessly clean, and the rooms are comfortable and well equipped, with several English speaking channels on the flat screen tv. The double bed was large and really comfortable, and downstairs in the hotel reception they had vending machines with snacks and cold drinks. All in a fantastic place to stay, and fantastic value for money.", "title": "Super location, great bed!", "user": "saoirsechick", "date": "October 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 84252190}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 11, "average": 99, "very good": 302, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 149}, "slim_ranking": 0.23988005997}
