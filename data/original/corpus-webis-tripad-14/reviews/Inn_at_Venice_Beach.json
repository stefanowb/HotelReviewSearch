This review is waaaaaay overdue. Searched and searched for a hotel in the Marina Del Rey area and came up with this renovated boutique hotel. Was concerned about where to stay because our trip was 9 days long. Must say that I am a cleanliness freak. Did I mention \"cleanliness freak\"?! Traveled with a friend and stayed in one of the loft rooms. Very convenient. Room at the back of the hotel. Queen size bed upstairs. Queen size pull-out bed downstairs. It worked out perfectly. Only had one issue upon arriving and that was quickly taken care of. Our room was cleaned well everyday. Everyone was friendly. EVERYONE, from the maintenance man to the housekeepers to the front desk, especially Alfonso. He really made the stay nice. Must love the breakfast. Lots of bread-type goodies. Hard-boiled eggs. Juices. Hot and cold cereal. And, fresh fruit...bananas, apples and oranges. It reminds me so much of Europe. There was a wonderful courtyard, but we never sat in it because of the weather being a bit chilly. Next time. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. And, I'm picky. Was sick while I was there. The housekeepers always made sure that I had extra towels and extra pillows. If you're looking for the big-time chain hotel, this is not that. But, if you're looking for something different that is close to the beach and near good restaurants, chose this hotel. I cannot say enough good things about it. They really made my stay enjoyable. The next time I'm in the Marina Del Rey/Venice Beach area, I will definitely chose the Inn at Venice Beach. Hey! I'm a card-carrying Marriott member, which is only about 5 blocks away.
