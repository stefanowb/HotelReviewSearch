This is not the place to be in Miami. First off the elevators are death traps. They are about 100 more rides away from somebody being hurt or seriously injured. Who would build a ten+ story building with only two elevators? Oh yeah and a service elevator which had mind of it's own. One day it stop at every floor without opening the doors till it reached the lower level. The next day it wouldn't even go to the lower level so we had to walk down from the fourth floor. Also, this hotel charges for everything: Roll away bed...$15/day. Breakfast bufett...$12/day. Valet Parking....$18/day. $.50 Hot dogs for $8 at the poolside...Priceless! The biggest surprise is that there is nothing near this place. The only business near here is Walgreens. No restaurants and a cab to south beach can run between 10 to 12 dollars. We walked to Walgreens one night and it look like a bad episode of 21 Jumpstreet. People were all on the corners hanging out in the front of the other hotels like gangs. We stayed here doing Memorial Day weekend and we all wished that we stayed at a nicer hotel closer to South Beach.

When we arrived in Miami and called for directions to the hotel no one could speak enough english to tell us how to get to the hotel. The first night of our stay we discovered that the walls we so thin that we could hear everything, and I do mean everything that the people on either side of us were doing. This became appearent when a fight broke out and the police were called. On the second night several rooms of very intoxicated girls began to have party in the hallway at 2am. We called the front desk and they asked which rooms the girls were in. We replied we didn't know. We called back a few minutes later when no security had arrived and it looked like the group of 20 was going to go down the elevators. The front desk informed us there was nothing they could do because they didn't know who was coming off the elevators. We called a third time that night when several males stood outside in the hallway having cell phone conversations. Security did come up this time, asked the men to take their conversations elsewhere, the men smarted off to the security and the security left. For two hours this went on till the night manager finally came up and told us that we might as well stop calling because the best anyone could do was get us a new room in the morning. The next morning when we went to the front desk we were not allowed to move and told that \"this is Miami Beach it's a party.\" On the third and last night of our stay, a man began punching our door after a fight with someone in the hallway. We called the front desk who told us \"what do you want us to do he'll be gone by the time we get up there.\" This hotel was awful.
