I took the train and not knowing where the hotel was, walked out to the taxi stand to ask them. The taxi driver pointed across the parking lot and sure enough, there was the hotel. The entire area has beautiful architecture. I wish I had time to explore. Because I had an early morning flight, the train was not an option to the airport so it really wasn't the best location for me but the hotel organized a taxi with a fare of 47 euros. He did an excellent job of conveying me there. The people at the hotel were friendly. My room, however, was a long way from the lobby. The bedding was comfortable and the room was quiet. I met other people in the elevator that reported being frequent visitors. I found the staff to be very helpful.", "title": "Convenient if you are visiting Amsterdam but not luxurious", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SEAPexplorer012", "date": "May 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 161403515}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Amsterdam is a wonderful place to spend a few days.
