We've passed through Pismo a million times and have never stopped. We stayed here for a night before the holidays and it was wonderful. The front desk was very welcoming and responsive. We had an ocean view room and could sit on our balcony and watch and listen to the winter surf. There are several surf spots within walking distance and a nice pathway in front of the hotel. The property has its own restaurant where we had a very good breakfast. During the holidays they offer crafting and movies for kids and my daughter loved that. The young woman running the crafts was a student from Cal Poly and excellent with kids. The pool is located at the rear of the property next to the ocean and they keep it quite warm, which was nice since it was rainy when we went and we were still able to swim. The hot tub is spacious and hot! The hotel seems a little older, but it is very well run and clean. Since their pool area is so welcoming with a fire pit, view, etc. I could hear chatter during the evening since our room was facing this area and could see how it might be hard to sleep if it was peak season, so you might want to request a room off to the side if you have a family and go to sleep early. We will definitely return for more than a night next time and maybe even make it an annual tradition to go for some r&r during the busy holiday season. We arrived with colds and went home feeling rejuventated.
