I must admit I was very nervous about the negative stereotypes of New York, and after my plane being delayed and the disgusting condition of La Guardia Airport, I was not in the best mood. But the shuttle driver for the hotel came and picked us up and he was extremely friendly and helpful. We got to the hotel and the front desk clerk was friendly and fast. The beds were amazing!! I don't think I've ever fallen asleep that fast in my life! The next day I needed to use the computer and the wired internet in my room wasn't working and neither was the internet in the lobby so they let me use the manager's computer in the back office. The shuttle driver then gave us a ride to the closest subway station and we went about our sightseeing.
