They will do anything for you - call to see if something is open, help you navigate via maps, answer e-mails before you arrive (they answered all of my questions promptly and efficiently). The place was an abbey (that is what Abbazia means) and the pulpit in the lounge provides great ambience. I had many requests regarding rooms and the staff managed to meet them all!!! We stayed there December 17 for 4 nights which is a slow time of year. They gave our family 2 rooms on the second floor (there are no elevators) that were both behind an outside door so we could shut that and get between our 2 rooms very efficiently. The rooms had burgundy silk walls - you felt like you were in Italy! We had a great tiled shower with doors - my one suggestion to the staff is to hang a shower basket from the door for guests to put soap and shampoo in (not a big deal but easier for use). The beds are nice and long but a bit hard - the way it seems Italians like their beds. The breakfast was wonderful with boiled eggs, juice, hot chocolate, various coffees, croissonts, buns, ham, meat, cheese, yogurt, cereal, toast, fruit - a full selection. Everything was tasty and good. The location was right around the corner from the train station and easy to wheel luggage between there and the hotel (they even tell you where to turn that avoids the steps). Coming from the airport we took the Aliguana boat because we thought a boat ride would be scenic but I recommend the land bus (I think it's the ACTV - if you e-mail them they will send you directions from the drop-off to the hotel which you need because it is easy to get lost in Venice). The bus is 5 euro a person and the Aliguana is 15 euro/person and the bus is quicker and picked up right outside the airport whereas you have to walk quite a way at the airport to catch the boats. It's a nice walk to St. Mark's (maybe 25 minutes, I'm a slow walker) past lots of shopping so it's fun to stop and look. I recommend going in the off-season because rates are cheaper and you can even bargain on a gondola ride for your family (I think we paid about 80 euro for a 50 minute ride for the 4 of us that went all around the grand canal, under the Rialto bridge and in side canals). The best is to bargain to 60 euro and tell them you will give him a good tip if you like the ride - he even sang and whistled). The weather was cool and we wore 2 layers of light jackets so we could take one off when it warmed up. We took the train for a day trip to Verona and it worked well . We took the local trains which stop more but are cheap - but know that you have to validate your ticket at a machine before getting on the train for the local/regional trains - or you can get a huge fine.

The breakfast served was pretty much standard but decent. Though they did not serve omelettes, baked beans or hashbrownies. Maybe I was expecting too much. The staff guided us on the places of tourist interest and how to take the water taxi that is the means of transport in Venice.

One is the expansive, comfortable livingroom where one can go to read a book, meet up with the rest of one's party or have a cup of tea or a cocktail in the afternoon. It is lightly scented with a delicious incense that gives meaning to the term \"aroma therapy.\" The other is the sun-bathed garden. After a few days of typical spring rain, we couldn't resist sitting out there, absorbing the warmth and feeling far from the crowds of the Venice streets -- just outside the garden walls. We were two moms traveling with a total of 3 kids. We took a double and a quad (the triple being full). Our room (the quad) was clean and plenty spacious with a big bathroom and tub. The included breakfast, which was in the little dining room, offered plenty of selections for all tastes. The hotel's proximity to the train station enabled us to get in and out of Venice with relative ease, especially in the pouring rain.
