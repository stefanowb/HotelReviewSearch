As I was on a solo trip I decided to stay in the hotel instead of going out for something to eat. What a mistake that was. I had the smoked chicken curry soup, it was ok, not much taste although it was a little cool. Then I had the spiced lamb with rice and nan bread. I'm not joking when I say this but I'm sure they used the curry soup and put lamb instead of chicken, it tasted the same. I told the waiter that and he said I think it's different ingredients....
