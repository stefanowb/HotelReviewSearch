In terms of atmosphere, it could compare with any great restaurant in New York. There is a substantial wine list that has some great bottles, something that is not so common in Mexico. The food was inconsistent. I got a rib eye, which was very good, but the duck appetizer was tough and unappetizing. The fried octopus was delicious, but the shrimp app with a tomato and chile sauce was very salty. The arugula and pear salad was great, the seafood pasta was ordinary. Ek Chuah offers a fun night out in M\u00e9rida, and some of the dishes are great, but I would recommend sticking to the simple items on the menu--this is not a restaurant that excels at innovative cuisine.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "amibee", "date": "December 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 91218318}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "beautiful restaurant, but expensive", "text": "We ate at this restaurant our last night in Merida.

The owner just happened to be there and he came over to our table and we had a nice conversation with us. He also left word at the hotel side to have the staff give us a tour of the hotel.
