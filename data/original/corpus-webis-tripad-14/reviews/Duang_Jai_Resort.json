The hospitality at Duang-Jai is really top notch. The manager, Jeab, especiallymade us feel very well cared for. She seemed to consider service to the guests a personal responsibility. She is in the hotel around the clock almost every day of the week, so, even when one of the less experienced staff members makes a mistake, she is there to provide a personal apology and to correct the mistake. For travelers like us who don't like crowds or formality, but who like to be pampered, Duang Jai was the perfect place. Jeab arranged for the two of us to receive Thai massages from two very skilled massage therapists in our room 4 nights in a row. That was really heavenly. We had one of the top floor rooms. The best thing about these rooms is that they are very spacious and have different areas. It was one of the few hotels we stayed in in Thailand that didn't make us feel claustrophobic. The room was set up like a suite, which was nice. There was a semi-kitchen with a dish-rack, dishes, and large sink. It made it easy for us to have meals in the room. We had a large balconey. And there was also a large shower. They charged a fair price for water and beers in our refrigerator. Even though it is not on the most popular part of Krabi beach, we did not find it a problem because we rented a motorbike which was very fun to ride around.

First of all,when we reached the airport, we had a very friendly guy that drove to our resort. The receptionist was very friendly,recommended to us where are the places we should visit. And every morning,the staffs will greet us and asked how was our sleep last night. The resort is quite a new resort, where the room was beautiful, exactly the same as we seen on the website. It has all the facilities that needed, such as kettle, safe box,fridge, hot shower etc. I also particularly like the thick quilt blanket as it is very comfortable to cover with at night. The pool though is not very big, but it's beautiful and there's a jacuzzi too. From the resort to the main road, it's only 5-10 minutes walk, and there are lightings along the way in to the resort at night. So it's quite safe, it's good to have a short walk after a meal. So it's a great place to stay in, we would definitely go back there the next time.
