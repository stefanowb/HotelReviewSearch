Location is right on restaurant row so there are dozens of your favorite restaurants within blocks. Also within a mile or 2 from galleria shopping. The room was kind of small for a suite, no door dividing 2 rooms just a half wall and a TV that tilted toward the bed or fold out couch. With 3 adults and 1 infant, it was a little crammed, also not a ton of privacy from person on foldout couch. Otherwise a nice hotel. Great location, .5 miles from Addison airport.", "title": "great hotel/location, small room", "user": "Herk_Driver", "date": "November 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6156089, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location/breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 room size"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "THE BEST!", "text": "This was the best hotel experience I have ever had.
