The tents are superbly equipped with thoughtful touches that make a real difference to comfort with electricity in the evenings to the tent. The restaurant was excellent at both dinner and breakfast with nothing being too much trouble.Locally grown food and soon to be opened bakery provide further local skills development. Visitors should go and visit the Children's Home which George and Marisa also manage. The quality of care offered to the orphans, primarily from HIV/Aids, is of the highest quality and there has been a similar investment in the local primary and secondary schools.

We walked up and toured the children's home before dinner. We took some school supplies and they were graciously accepted. The home and school seemed very well designed and run. Some of the other guests played soccer with the kids of the home. The main lodge is attractive and our 8-yr-old loved playing with the resident kittens. The food was very good as was the service. The Dutch couple (both retired doctors) who built and run the camp are friendly and very interesting to talk to.
