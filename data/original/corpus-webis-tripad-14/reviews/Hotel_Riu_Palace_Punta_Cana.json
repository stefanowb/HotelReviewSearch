My husband and I were there for our honeymoon. The beach was really amazing! Like postcard. But I have to admit that after you get over the initial beauty of the place, there just isn't much left. I can't exactly put my finger on it.....but it just doesn't have any character. The animation team sang the same songs and did the same games everyday. The would change into suits at night and do the same song and dance in the evening. Everything was so repetitive that I knew what they were going to do before they did it. We were there for a week, but after four days we were totally bored. We were content with laying on the beach all day, but after dinner, forget about it! Everyone would sit in the courtyard with blank looks on their face from the bland so-called entertainment, and around 11pm everything basically shut down. We did the Outback Safari Excursion and had a decent time although it was very hot, but that was expected. We ate at the Brazilian restuarant one night and I thought it was good, but the restuarant was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, they need a little background music or something. We tried to eat at the Steakhouse one night but they served everyone but my husband and I and we were there before several other groups, finally we just walked out.. We didn't want to pull the race card, but we had to wonder if it was because we were very dark skinned African Americans?

My husband and I decided after unpacking that we definitely needed a drink. Went to the pool area with our suits on sat down and thought okay ready for the start of our very much needed vacation. Styed by the pool for about 2 hours had our drinks and decided it was time to get showered and dressed for dinner. The water in the room was just barely warm. I thought it was because it was close to dinner time and everyone was taking showers. Had a fairly decent dinner, had a drink, went to watch the entertainment, went back to room(which was beginning to smell worse) and went to sleep. Yes, now it's Monday a.m. time to shower before going for breakfast...no hot water!!!! Stopped at reception before breakfast to tell them that there was a problem. They said they would have it fixed. At 4:00 p.m. there still was no hot water. They said they were working on it. Tuesday a.m. again or still no hot water. They said by noon it would be fixed. Around noon I still had no hot water,once again went down to reception and was told the hot water would be on soon. I also talked to our Apple Rep who said she knew there was a problem but she was told that they gave them until Wednesday afternoon to fix the problem. Wednesday a.m. still same old song and dance. Water will be on by 4:00. These stories were getting old. I asked to talk to a manager. About 5 minutes latter Mario appears. I told him how disappointed I was that I kept on getting different stories. I also noticed that they were still taking in guests as if there was not a problem. I was real upset as I saw girls coming in carrying wedding gowns waiting to have a wonderful wedding, I truly felt very sorry for them. They were in for a big surprize Stinky rooms and no hot water. Mario and I did not see eye to eye on how they were dealing with a bad situation. I was wondering how all the help washed their hands. I was thinking of the health issues that could be arising. I was told then that it just wasn't the Palace that had no hot water but the whole chhain of Riu's in Punta Cana. I asked him when we were going to get the hot water and he finally said he could not guarantee when. I went back to the Apple rep and told her that I think she and Mario better talk. I asked her if Apple had a back up plan...she was not aware of any. By this time I was fuming. I was a lady on a mission to get the heck out of there. All I wanted was a hot shower. Yes, I realize that we are in a foreign third world country and the price we paid for the week definitely should have included hot water.This was a 6 star hotel that really had no idea how to handle a problem like this. At 4:50 that Wednesday afternoon I headed back up to our room...no hot water...back down to reception to find out what they had to say this time. Talked to Apple rep she said she could make me out a voucher to go to Dreams Resort but the bus was leaving at 5:20. Panicking I told her to make out the voucher, ran to get my husband to tell him that we had to get packed, check out of the hotel and be on a bus within 30 minutes.Poor guy road on the bus in wet swim trunks. I was lucky enough to be able to throw on a pair of shorts over my bathing suit. After a 35 minute bus ride we were at Dreams, It was a nice resort, workers were very friendly but I would not say that it is a 6 star Resort. Our vacation finally started late Wedneday nite. The pool was awsome. At 8;30 Sunday a.m. we were back on our way to the airport. Then when we got home and went to unpack Oh my God!!!!! The luggage stunk. So far I washed the clothes 2 times and they still stink from mold. I ave had the luggage out in the sun for 2 days and have been disinfecting it with spray and Frabreeze. I think I have to pitch the luggage. Like I said it was the worst vacation ever. You know, never did we get an apology or gee, I'm sorry. Sometimes it's the things like that that help you forgive...but I definitely must warn everyone The people at the Palace are not nice nor do they care what you think. The manger refused to give me his business card when I asked him. It's just the courtious thing to do when asked.", "title": "LOVED THIS RESORT", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "dennyd58", "date": "May 11, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15933309, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 beach", "disliked": "\u2014 NO DISLIKES"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I recently spent the week of may 2nd to may 9th at this faboulous resort.

Upon arriving at the airport we were taken back by the 50's style airport --open air, the plane pulls pretty much up to the front. Gates 1 - 4 are open air and gates 5 and up are a/c. Be prepared to move quickly cause it is extremely hot in the airport. Upon getting our luggage the baggage boys were all over us like white on rice to take our bags to the bus. Let them do it, it will save you a lot of stress and you only have to slip them a couple of dollars (they're very appreciative of anything you tip). Our bus ride was interesting as you get to see much of the depressed countryside. Some areas are really saddening to see. After dropping off passengers to their respective hotels we finally got to see ours, breathtakingly beautiful. Like a palace!!! Pristine exterior and landscapingly appealing---we were impressed. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous and spacious. The desk clerks are very helpful and do their best to accomodate. There are really no beach views but a garden view is very, very nice. We were in room 0065 which was a mini suite. The rooms are recessed from the halls and when you enter a mildew smell will overwhelm you. It's not a \"caribbean\" smell, its a funky smell. We took candles and it mellowed out the smell. After a couple of days, you get used to it and don't even notice. The rooms are spacious enough with a large bed, beautiful tiled floors and marble tops. The balconies offer a nice view of the property. We could see the beach and pool from our balcony, as well as the restaurants and courtyard. We rose early each day to see the sunrise at about 6:15. So beautiful to see. You should place a towel in your beach chairs that you want at that time (if you wait until after breakfast you won't get your pick of chairs/spots). You get towel cards at checkin. If you lose them or your towels, you have to pay extra to get them. Breakfast everyday was at Don Manual's Restaurant. Same food every day for the most part. I enjoyed the fruit bar. At 8:45 everyday they accept reservations for dinner. We ate at the Gourmet, Italian and Brazilian. If you like food you'll enjoy the Brazilian Rest. The food just keeps coming. As far as the beach...the sun is best from around 8:00 to noon. We both used 30 spf and got a nice deep golden tan. The sun is so intense, you really can't stay out all day or you'll look like bacon. At about 3:00 we took a nice stroll on the beach, very enjoyable. Not too hot, nice breeze. They do have satellite TV if you like to watch news...NBC, ABC, CBS. Cable was out some of the time as well as the electric. It would go out in the middle of the night. Only rained about 3 times the whole time we were there and that was in the middle of the night for about 10 minutes. Crazy! The shows were absolutely horrible, the \"casino\" was a joke---about 20 slots and only 10 of them worked at most. The neighboring casino \"Macao\" was not much better with maybe 5 tables and about 25 to 30 machines all using pecos. Towers casino---about a 15 minute drive by taxi was available off the site. We heard a lot of mixed reviews about the excursions so we didn't go on any. The frozen drinks were either watered down or had big chunks of ice in them. Not like the caribbean drinks I've ever had elsewhere. Tip: If you want a decent mixed drink (Vodka sour, Scotch and water, etc...) order from the show bar. They serve more Americanized drinks. Only a handful of the help spoke English, so we had issues with translation. Ordered a scotch and water 3 times before they got it right. They do try to please though. Don't try room service, you'll wait forever. And very, very limited menu. BTW, you have to tote your safe key around with you everywhere. They put the cumbersome lock on a long string. Kind of weird and bothersome when you want to lighten your load to the beach and elsewhere. Long story short: If you enjoy total relaxation, beautiful beach (TOPLESS female bathers) pool, ho hum food and a very subdued, snippy atmosphere, then this is the place for you. If you enjoy lots of activities, having entertaining options, sounds of people laughing and having a good time, excellent food and a nice, comfortable bed/room then pick another location. This is not a location that we will personally go back to. Very boring.

We also ate at the brazilian place which doesn't compare to american brazilian restaurants, the steakhouse lobster and steak dinner was excellent, and sir oscar was above average. A tip..... the bars DO NOT put alcohol in your mixed drinks unless you ask for it. We figured that out 2 days in when nobody was getting drunk!!! :) The wedding was beautiful although we did have a blackout with power outage for 2 hours during the reception dinner... still had fun. Another power outage the next night but only for 30 min. Don't go here expecting the best food you ate, the best service you've ever gotten, the biggest casino with wins you ever had, or the most beautiful island in your life. Go here for a relaxing vacation where you don't have to take your wallet out once at the hotel and can put your feet up to chill.", "title": "There are some parts that are good, and others that are not", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HeatherTBH", "date": "May 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16438874, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Pool and beach", "disliked": "\u2014 Food"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just got back May 23, 2008. Not any problems at all. The resort was beautiful and clean. The staff was very helpful and most of them freindly. I felt that most tried very hard to speak English as best as they could but the ones that did not speak well, it might be taken as rude, but they were probably scared to talk if they didn't udnerstand you! We have stayed at many RIU throughout the Carribean and since some complained about a musty smell, that is a fact in all of them! It has airconditioning running constantly and the moisture in the air is going to do that anywhere! The food was good to above average although the ones in Mexico were superior....but that was our taste. Anyone with a negative review has come to expect way too much and comparing it with most Americans. They give you your moneys worth and you have to remember you are in another culture and society that isnt as priveledged. We probably wont go back to this country because outside, everyone has their hand out. From the minute you go thru the airport upon arrival, they make you buy a $10 tourist card, he hands it to you and a few feet later they trash it! Money trap! They say you need $20 each upon departure too. We did not run into that, but do expect it from what we understand. I love how they try to get that last dollar buy making you wait in your bus or taxi until the PORTERS take your luggage from the vehicle and you have to get it from them. Almost guarantees a tip because it makes you feel bad if you dont. The boys trying playing a trio of music upon boarding the flight with a hat out for tips. So expect that you may need to have a few bucks on ya! The waters are very pretty and lots of Palm trees and plent of drinks. Just say \"Mucho Rum\" if you want to get all waxed up! The buffett has a different theme each night and we just preferred to do that. We tried the formal restaurants at other RIU/s and they are pretty much the same. I dont like having to be a sitting for a 615pm or the 900 pm dinner. I prefer to go when I am ready. But the buffett does require MEN to wear long pants! Weird, because you can have a T shirt on and the women can be half naked! lol This is just at dinner. One night I decided to drink in the room and just ordered room service...it comes with it and was pretty good. The nice thing about this place too is that 5 RIU resorts are there back to back and has a long paved trail along the beach and you can hang out at any of them! The casino isnt much so dont get excited about that. Youll lose every time. They are very small and not much choice in machines. Not like the casinos in USA. If you get a decent price, it is a very good value and since the transportation comes with it, that went well also because it will cost you about $50 each way for taxit or what ever or more. So if you havent been, you will enjoy it. If you are a multi millionaire, you probably wont.
