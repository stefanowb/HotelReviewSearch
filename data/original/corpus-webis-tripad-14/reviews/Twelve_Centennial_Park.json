We didn't want the hassle or expense of getting or parking a car, so I chose this hotel because of it's proximity to CNN and the Aquarium. Both are within walking distance to Twelve (CNN was 0.7 miles and the Aquarium was about a half mile) . As someone else mentioned, one of the streets to the Aquarium is quite steep, but we found that going over a block and using Ivan Allen Blvd. wasn't nearly as steep. The MARTA is right across the street from the hotel, but with both CNN and the aquarium so close it didn't make sense for us to use it.", "title": "Great hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "KarenSMichigan", "date": "February 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13544546, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 comfortable bed, nice linens, great televisions, within walking distance to what we wanted to see", "disliked": "\u2014 downtown location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with family", "text": "A downside to the location is the fact that it's downtown. There wasn't a lot of foot traffic which surprised me. I didn't have a lot of time to research before I made the arrangements for this trip, so didn't find out until later how the sidewalks roll up after business hours in downtown Atlanta. We were able to find a couple restaurants within walking distance, but there wasn't a lot of action on the street. In fact, when we walked to the Aquarium on Saturday morning, we seemed to be the only ones ON the street.", "title": "Great hotel, ideal service", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "HoangCheng", "date": "December 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12083288}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Twelve is a beautiful hotel.
