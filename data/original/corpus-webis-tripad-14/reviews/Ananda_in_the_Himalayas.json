Each showed a genuine interest in my wellbeing and did everything they possibly could to take care of any request or need that I had no matter how big or small. The spa was fantastic. The services were amazing. They used many local, organic ingredients for treatments and treatments had a strong quality of attention and spirituality. The food was out of this world - the very best Indian food I've ever had. Every meal was a pleasure and nourished me deeply. The chefs care deeply about what they produce. I spent 4 nights here and left totally refreshed - mind, body, soul, spirit - everything. I've never before experienced such transformation so quickly. This place, this energy, the food, the people - all made it possible. I have just one complaint - and that's that the buildings (rooms, restaurant, spa) are all very ordinary in style and construction approach - just like any other high end hotel, nothing so special. All of the advertising for Ananda shows a picture of a gorgeous castle. Turns out the castle is not part of the resort and is off limits except for a bit that's used for the offices and meditation class. I feel mislead by this point. I'm still offering a 5 star review because it's primarily about the people, the people who work here were so wonderful they deserve 5 stars and the experience was 5 star because of them.
