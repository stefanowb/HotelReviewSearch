Whilst the views were indeed superb, this possibly once grand resort provides very substandard grubby accommodation, with stained carpets, poor bathrooms and rock hard pillows and grimy bedding. Although accommodation of this standard is not unusual in Nepal, at a non-negotiable USD80/night this place is grossly overpriced. Only the thought of a three hour drive down the mountain roads in the dark persuaded us to stay.", "title": "Great views, shame about the hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Intrepidtoo", "date": "November 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6184795, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The views", "disliked": "\u2014 Everything else"}}], "location": {"country": "Nepal", "region": "Central Region", "continent": "Asia"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 3, "very good": 4, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 2}, "aka": "Everest Panorama Hotel Daman", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
