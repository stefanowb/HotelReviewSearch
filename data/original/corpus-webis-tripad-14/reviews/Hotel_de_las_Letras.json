The room and bathroom were both good sizes, the bed was marvoulous and I had to struggle to get myself out of bed, it was very quite in the hotel and my room. The only complaint I had was that the shower water would get very hot and then back to warm so I had to step away from the stream every 30 seconds are so. The receptionists were great and provided me with great directions and recommendations. The location of the hotel was also great, it was on a major street, and I was a bit worried as I read on a tour book that Gran Via was not recommended at night, but the staff assured me that it was quite safe and there were always people around. I was within walking distance to shopping, museums, and parks and was able to find great tapas bars along the way. I walked home at night alone at 1am and 3am and never had a problem or felt unsate.
