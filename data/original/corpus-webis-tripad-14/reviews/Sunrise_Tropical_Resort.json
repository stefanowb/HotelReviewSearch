Yes, the hotel is on East Railey but it really is only five mins walk to the proper beach on the W. The staff are friendly and the room lovely, large, dark wood, white walls and bright fabrics. There wasn't any of the best rooms left when we booked - others said you should go for the deluxe (or whatever the nmae of the better ones is) but the standard was great. Small pleasant pool. Bad breakfast but didn't matter to us. Hotel is dry but so close to a range of relaxed bars both E & W that it didn't matter. The renowned Phra Nang beach was a disappointment mind - very busy and did have boats zooming in. We preferred W Railey beach though it was pretty busy too - this is not a castaway, beach to yourself place. So easy to get to from Ao Nang and when we arrived at Railey we were pleased by how low key it all is - not 'built up' at all. Yes, there are a fair few hotels but they are all low rise and attractive from the beach and look more like beach bars.", "title": "A tropical beach break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AlYorks", "date": "January 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6558078, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beach and relaxed beach bar scene on W Railey", "disliked": "\u2014 No good on advice for us re getting to our next destination"}}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 26, "average": 59, "very good": 157, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 89}, "aka": "Sunrise Tropical Hotel Railay Beach", "slim_ranking": 0.363636363636, "description": "Sunrise Tropical Resort, an exclusive resort on Railay East Beach."}
