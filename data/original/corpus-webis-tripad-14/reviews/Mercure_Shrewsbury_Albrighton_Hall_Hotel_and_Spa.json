The spa facilities were really good, but it was quite busy by the pool and very noisy. We had bedroom number two, which was beautiful with a very comfortable bed. The curtains were dark so you could sleep well... Apart from the extremely loud banging noise coming from below which was the kitchens! It woke us up at 7am which wasn't planned for our relaxing trip. We did complain to reception and they took \u00a325 off the bill. But the receptionist sounded surprised by our complaint which I have since read about on tripadvisor so they do know about this issue. The staff were very helpful and polite during our stay.

The setting is very nice and the grounds are well kept, although it was raining all the time we were there so we weren't able to enjoy the outdoor areas. Our room was in the extended part of the hotel near to the spa. Room was a decent size and clean but there was no air conditioning and it got really stuffy at night so we had to have the window open, and consequently it wasn't a very comfortable night's sleep and we were woken by the birds singing at 4:30am. The pool was clean and the water nice and warm, although the jacuzzi was a bit small. The extended part of the hotel must be at least 15 years old and is starting to show its age - everything is a bit 1990s. It is desperately in need of a lick of paint and the carpet on the staircase was threadbare in places. The original part of the hotel is really nice and the Oak Room Restaurant is a pleasant place to have a meal. We enjoyed our evening meal and the food was tasty and well presented. We'd chosen our evening meal time when we booked which turned out to be the right decision as when we checked in another couple were having to eat a lot later than they wanted to. Breakfast was a self-service buffet which I always find a bit chaotic and I had to wait a few minutes for more eggs to arrive, but considering it was late in the service it was good to find that the food was still being freshly made. Throughout our stay the staff were really helpful. Overall not much to complain about given the price but I wouldn't stay again mainly because of the issue with temperature control in the room. There is still some way to go if they want to compete with the likes of a Hilton Doubletree and they need to invest in a refresh in the extended part of the hotel. Little touches like having a supply of newspapers in the bar would make a difference.", "title": "OK but needs a refresh", "user": "Peejdj", "date": "June 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 131619816}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I booked in here for a quick anniversary get away.

Upon our arrival at the hotel the grounds were beautiful and we were initially impressed. We checked in at Reception and were greeted by a friendly and amicable receptionist. We asked if we could book a table for four people for dinner, and were told that no table would be available until 2030 hours which was too late for us and had to go out for dinner in Shrewsbury town centre. This greatly inconvenienced us as it was supposed to be a relaxing break. When we were handed our room key we checked out the bed and were disappointed to find that the kingsize bed was two single beds pushed together. This left a large ridge in the middle of the bed which was uncomfortable. We then looked in the bathroom and discovered that when taking a shower, the shower head was faulty and sprayed water onto the tiled floor. There was no bathmat to soak up the water and we were forced to use bath towels instead, this is a clear health and safety hazard.
