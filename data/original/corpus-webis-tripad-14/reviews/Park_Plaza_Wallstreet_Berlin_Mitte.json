Just make sure you exit out of the right set of stairs.... For the hotel itself I was rather disappointed after reading some of the glowing reviews and seeing pictures. The rooms look MUCH better in photos than in person. We found them rather tacky and cheap looking which can be easily overlooked. My biggest complaint however is that it was filthy! I had to wipe down the counters in the bathroom because there was hair and soap residue on them. The floor was really disgusting with hair everywhere and stains like someone kept their shoes in there. We asked the front desk if they could mop it quickly the next morning but it was never done in the 3 days we were there. I think they just swept it once. There is so much dust and grime built up that it was really disgusting. It's like they never dusted, even though there are ledges right beside the bed. Sleep quality was poor for myself and my husband. We don't really like hard beds and these were like sleeping on the floor. The good thing was that you don't get any street noise as the hotel is located in a very quiet area. Oh and there is free internet you just need to ask the front desk for some vouchers to get the username and password for 24 hrs. There isn't however free breakfast which was rather disappointing as this was the only hotel we stayed in that didn't provide that. You'll have to go to Alexanderplatz or somewhere else to find some restaurants as there didn't seem to be anything close to the hotel. For a hotel that was recently renovated I expected the rooms to be in better shape.
