The hotel was everything I had imagined - lots of charm and individuality which set it apart from the normal 3* experience. The hotel management were very friendly and helpful at all times. The rooms were immaculate and cleaned each day very throughly and quickly. The hotel's gardens are lush and proved a most relaxing experience - lots of little nooks and crannies to explore. There are a couple of patio areas next to the the pool which are worth getting up early for if you want a bit of privacy when sunbathing. We always managed to get a sunbed, even in the afternoons which was a welcome change. The pool itself is not large and if you enjoy a really good swim this will not win any points but very clean and warm. The views from the hotel are stunning and cannot be beaten. However, make sure you get a bedroom on the 3rd floor if you want the best views - our room was number 59 - private terrace with loungers and in my opinion, the best room right in the middle. We had to pay quite a large supplement but it was definitely worth it and the view at night was absolutely fantastic and very romantic. It definitely made our stay just perfect. Some bedrooms on lower floors mayl be obstructed with trees and could possibly prove frustrating. Avoid bedrooms at front of hotel as road runs past which although not a main road as such, can prove noisy as the Italians do like using their car horns rather a lot! Our room was not huge but had everything in it that we needed and the bed was really comfortable. We had to ask for extra pillows and these were provided immediately and with a smile. Breakfast was typical for Italy - I personally really enjoyed it and left feeling satisfied and ready for the day. If you expect egg and bacon, you should probably not be considering Italy anyway. The hotel is ideally situated for the town - only a short stroll taking you past the public gardens which are absolutely lovely on a hot day and well worth wandering through. I cannot fault the hotel. We have stayed in lots of 5* concrete jungles and this hotel beats them all. I would not hesitate in booking again when we return to Taormina which we definitely shall as we absolutely fell in love with it all. Take plenty of money as the whole experience does not come cheap but worth every penny.", "title": "Charming hotel in excellent prime location", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "janglebangle", "date": "June 25, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3610091}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love this hotel", "text": "I stayed at this hotel twice last year, once in May and again at the end of October.

The hotel itself is lovely. Appears to be family owned and managed, so there were lots of children and families. The views from many of the windows were incredible -- looking out over the sea and a vista of flowers. We have lovely weather, so the pool was packed with sunbathers, but there are lots of little nooks and crannies to take a book and hide. We were fortunate to secure a sea-view; our friends were not as fortunate, with a room at the back. It is definitely worth spending the extra money for the view; I'm not sure I'd want to stay here without one. The rooms are clean and well furnished, although not particularly spacious. This isn't a problem if you have a balcony or patio, but if not, things could get a bit cramped. Lunch is available pool-side, and is very good, though expensive. Breakfasts are great, with lots of choices. The parking is another story. There is a large driveway and small parking lot; all cars are somehow miraculously parked; looks like a jumble, and you really believe you'll never see your car again! As we were staying 3 days, our car was somehow moved into a corner; I couldn't watch as the porter got it out -- somehow, with no scratches. If I had it to do over again, I'd park in one of the public lots and then taxi to the hotel, so that at least I could feel that if I needed the car, I could get to it!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 15, 2005", "id": 3473774}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent our last 4 days of a 3 week trip here and loved it all.
