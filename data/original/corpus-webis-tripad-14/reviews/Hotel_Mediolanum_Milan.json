One drawback: broken lock box in the room that refused to open following the input of the programmed password by the hotel guests but was easily opened by one the hotel servant with the press of only one button (the lock box did not behave as was described in the instruction). Who needs the lock box that is managed not by its owner but by any hotel servant? Best way to avoid this problem is not to use the safe box.
