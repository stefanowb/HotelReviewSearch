We were heading on down to Yosemite the following day but looked forward to an evening in Reno. Because it was just a one night stay, we didn't want to hassle with staying at any of the casinos and opted for a location where we could get in and out of easily. After reading other reviews we thought the Comfort Inn Airport location was perfect for us and we were not disappointed. The room was very nice with very comfortable beds and 4 pillows on each bed. We were interested in going into town to try our luck at the Casinos and the free shuttle service worked perfectly. When we were ready to come back all we had to do was call the front desk and request a pickup. The breakfast the next morning was more that adequate with plenty of seating. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this facility to anyone who wants a no muss-no fuss approach to Reno.", "user": "ocsurvivor", "date": "June 23, 2008", "id": 17167531}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Place for the Price", "text": "We decided to stay at this property after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor.

I must say that the hotel is not in the best of neighborhoods and we were a little nervous about our choice at first. The parking lot to the hotel is surrounded by walls, with one entrance, so that is good in terms of security. But there were numerous \u201csketchy types\u201d rolling around the area on bicycles, which appeared to be burglars and/or thieves just waiting to break into your car.
