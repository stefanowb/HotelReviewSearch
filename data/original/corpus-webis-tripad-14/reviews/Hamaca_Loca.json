This is not luxury. The constant wind from the sea is what keeps these places bearable without A/C or ceiling fans during the muggy summer months, and yes, the wind and waves are loud. We loved the sound but others have complained that it's too noisy. We saw a few bugs, in particular a giant centipede. This can't really be avoided - the palapa roof lets the wind in, but also critters! Luckily the mosquito netting above the bed let us sleep in peace and we didn't get a single bite while we were here. As is typical in Mexico, the beds are hard, and due to the graywater system the shower water (as well as most likely the washing water) is salty, meaning the sheets and towels were a bit stiff. Like I said, this isn't a 5 star hotel.
