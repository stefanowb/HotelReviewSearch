Very pleasant work out room had two eliptical trainers that did not have functioning displays, though they worked fine if you watched the clock. One person tried hard to fix this and a manager finally told me that a battery charger was missing and that they would try to get it fixed. Hotel very attractively decorated - had Mitchell Gold chairs in the very clean king bedded room in which we stayed.. On a Saturday, the lobby was taken over with special events in the am. Attached Peoria restaurant was fine and service was attentive. Transportation to nearby Macy's at Stapleton Mall was excellent.

It was the worst experience . The front desk person Patty did not even know how to direct us to our room she sent us to the farthest elevator in the wrong direction . After being sent in the wrong direction we went all the way around the hotel. It was 99 degree's in Denver today and the Air conditioning was not turned on the second level so it was about 100 degree's on the second floor wandering almost passing out we finally located our room which was 15 steps off the elevator by the front desk??? When I asked Patty why she sent us that way she said \"Oh I do not know this hotel very well???? Entering our room to find the ac unit was turned off. We arrived at 7 and check in is after 3 no one turned the ac on in our room for our arrival our room was 93 degrees? The ac is still struggling freezing up every so often it is 80 degrees 3 hours later. We were not offered a remedy for this situation they stopped answering the front desk phone. We secured the room on Hotels . com and Frances from Hotels . com called and spoke to Patty then came back on the line with me trying to remedy the situation then went back to speak to Patty and Patty is no longer answering her calls??? .
