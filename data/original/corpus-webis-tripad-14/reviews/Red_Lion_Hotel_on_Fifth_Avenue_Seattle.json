We checked in at noon and the lady there was really nice and put us on whatever floor we wanted. When we entered the room it was still messy and it looked like people were still staying there - luckily no one was in there at the time so we just slowly backed out. Anyway, when we went back down to mention that the room was still occupied the lady at the desk upgraded us to a water view room for free and was just really nice. The water view room was nice because you could watch the ferries come and go at night and you could see pikes place and the sun (when it was out) was really nice on the water (there was a lot of construction in our view too, but hey..free upgrade?). Other nice things that lady did for us: gave us change for bigger bills so we could use the bus, found out which bus to take when we wanted to get to other areas or the airport (the 194 to the airport was only like $2 and it stops 2 blocks from the hotel), printed our boarding passes and was just really nice. I'd stay here again, but just if I got it through priceline - hey I'm cheap. Do avoid hotel dining though: we decided to try it out since we were soaked and freezing one night and didn't have time to change and get out to another place - overpriced and gross (rubbery chicken, tasteless sandwiches, overpriced hot chocolate (a swiss miss packet tossed into a cup of tepid water).
