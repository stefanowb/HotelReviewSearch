We were here for two nights on our way down to Milford Sound. The motel is in the perfect position. Just a casual and pretty eight minute stroll into town, yet also far enough out of the centre of town to enjoy a bit of peace and quiet (Queenstown is very touristy). It is worth paying that little bit extra to get the room with the Panoramic view. Even though you are perched at the top of the hill and you do look out over roof tops it is still a very lovely and interesting view. By interesting I mean there is always something to look at. Out to the left you can see the Remarkables, out in front the lake and more mountains and then out to the right, the gondola going up to the skyline restaurant and the zip trek course. The room isn't flash but it has everything you need and it is clean. They could use a ceiling fan. Or even a portable fan. Even with the windows open it was still quite warm. But then again, I suppose it does not get that warm there that often. Staff were pleasant and recommended some good places to eat. We stayed in one other place on our way back through Queenstown just to try something different. In hindsight we wished we had just come back to this place. We will definitely come back again on our next trip.", "user": "Tarin C", "date": "February 15, 2013", "id": 152229220}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just stay one night on our way to the Southland area. We booked a big room and we just got a partial lake view from outside the living room (since we were not at the end of the property). Room was fine but no A/C in bedroom, so you may need in summer to open the window to get some fresh air. There is no breakfast included in their rate and as other reviewers mentioned the 30 minutes free internet is a kind of letdown and we will not stay here again.

Out of one window we looked across the lake to the Remarkables and out of the other across another part of the lake and the peninsula to the mountains. It must be one of the most beautiful scenic views on earth. The room itself was large, spacious and very airy. A king size bed which was very comfortable, a well equipped kitchen and a very nice ensuite. The Motel is very handy for the town and you can easily walk into town. Although for us it was uphill back to Alexis and very difficult for us oldies. Parking is in an underground garage. Plenty of space for each car unless you get the idiot who thinks that you park astride the white line. Somebody left him a note on his windscreen. We never saw him again. A couple of problems, Because of the views from our room we kept getting Asian photographers outside our window taking pictures. You either draw your curtains and lose the view or watch your dress attire in the room. Breakfast was an extra cost, something not mentioned in their website or on their communications which are through the AA. WiFi is free but only for 30 mins per 24 hours something else not mentioned in their website or communications. Although when I pressed the point I was given another 100 MB but that can only be used for text.

We selected this place based on outstanding reviews and it\u2019s easy to see why everyone likes it. It\u2019s located about a ten minute walk from the heart of Queenstown but enough outside the hustle and bustle that it\u2019s very quiet at night (and this even included New Year\u2019s Eve - but we were close enough to be able to watch the fireworks from a balcony and sheltered from the rain). We asked the proprietor for a recommendation on good seafood and he gave us two choices. One was a fairly expensive but highly rated restaurant. The other was a seafood shack on the Marine Parade that was cheap but really good. He didn\u2019t even know the name (it\u2019s Aggy\u2019s) but knew it was a great deal. He was right! The rooms are spacious, clean, and ours included a spa tub. The view from our front window was of the Incredibles and the Frankton Arm of Lake Wakatipu. From the kitchen window (kitchen has cook top, refrigerator, sink, and microwave) we could see the gondola up to Skyline. Not bad for a budget location. There is a charge for local calls and we had to make five to confirm or change tour reservations. We went to the office to settle the bill and they said it\u2019s only $2 so forget it! What a great place and what great people! Note that they provide 30 min. of free internet per device per 24 hrs.
