The day we arrived, Launceston was blisteringly hot, and so was the room. The \"air conditioning\" was an evaporative cooler, and failed to reduce the room temperature less than 26 degrees. The fan in the bathroom did not work. The broadband did not work. There was no DVD player with the television. Despite leaving feedback, the hotel staff failed to make an attempt at fixing our problems.

We stayed on the 5th floor. The room and the bathroom were spacious, and the bed was comfortable. The decor was dated and is in need of an update. The breakfast was great; wide choice and well cooked. My biggest issue was with the heating in the room. There was no heating control. I presume there was heating coming in through the vent high up on the wall, but I found it cold (it was a minus 2 degree C. night). The water pressure was good, and the rooms seemed well sound-proofed. There was no noise at all in the rooms. The television channel selection is ordinary. It didn't have a full-range of free-to-air channels, while two of the limited range were dedicated to sports.
