The hotel was very easy to get to, and they thankfully had their own private car-park tucked in behind the building, as there was none available out on the street. The staff were warm, friendly and welcoming. We were pleasantly delighted by the room. We stayed in room 214. The bed was a decent size. Everything was clean, and the room was really nicely furnished. The curtains were nice and darkening, meaning we were able to sleep through the sunrise without getting disturbed by light entering the room. The walls were thick and we could not hear our neighbours at all while we were in our room. The bathroom was fancy and clean, and had a plentiful supply of shampoos etc, and even a shower-cap. Wifi was freely available, high-speed, and easy to connect to, even in our room. Plenty of tv channels and great reception. Food was wonderful too. We ordered room-service for dinner, including a 'sharing platter' of wings, ribs, wedges, and corn and it was very delicious - especially the ribs. We also ordered the sausages and mash which was delightful - the sausages tasted amazing. The food came quickly. All in all, this was a very comfortable stay, and if we ever came back to Chertsey we would stay here again for sure. The only down-side for us (and why I did not give it a full 5-star rating) was that there appeared to be no elevator. We had a couple of large suitcases, as we were trekking around the UK, and we had to lug the suitcases up a flight of stairs in order to get to our room. But, having said that, the stairs were not too far - we are young and fit and were able to carry them up without difficulty. The corridors were perfectly wide to allow us to take our suitcases down to our room without difficulty. There's also no swimming pool at this hotel, but that's no big deal.
