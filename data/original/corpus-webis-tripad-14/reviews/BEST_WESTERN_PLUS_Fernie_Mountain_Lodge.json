The bathroom was lovely and the shower produced lots of hot water. Our grandson enjoyed a swim in the pool and I noticed a hot tub in the pool area as well. Before checkout we ate a hot breakfast (included in the room price) which was better than many similar offerings in other places. Friendly, helpful staff included the front desk clerks, breakfast room servers, and housekeeping employees. And did I mention the value? Our lovely room and breakfast for three was $149 plus taxes. Only two minor problems: the hair dryer didn't work and we couldn't access the hotel's wireless on our laptop (although we had no difficulty on the iPad and iPhone.)
