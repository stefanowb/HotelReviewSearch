The lobby is pleasant and there is a large area for seating. The rooms were designed when Fairfield had a slightly larger footprint for rooms. My room was clean and quiet. Ask for an odd numbered room because these rooms are not up against the freeway which runs right by the property. The service at the front desk is friendly however they fail to recognize Marriott's Gold Members with any particular greeting or small gift. The breakfast is pretty standard selcetion of breads, bagels and waffles with a few add on items that re prepared off site. The one staff person that manages the breakfast area does a very good job of keeping the area well stocked. There is also a business center with two computers, free of charge, and a small pool and spa.", "title": "Friendly Older Fairfield Inn", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DCSacramento", "date": "April 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 102590842}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010", "text": "The worse hotel ive ever stayed at!
