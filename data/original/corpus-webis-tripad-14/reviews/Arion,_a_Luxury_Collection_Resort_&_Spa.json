It is right next to Westin, and customers have access to facilities at both places. The view is fantastic, and the atmosphere is relaxing with pools and other beach facilities. There is room in a building and room in bungalows (some with a private pool). The property is extensive and it takes quite a while to walk through. Breakfast has quite some variety. The sushi restaurant Matsuhisa has good ambiance but I found food so-so. The resort is about 45 min drive from city center (and the airport), and they do have a free shuttle that goes there but not so frequently, so if you stayed past 5:30pm be prepared to take a taxi (which is around 25-30 euros). Hotel staff is generally friendly and helpful. But I did have a quite unhappy experience one morning in the breakfast room. I chose a table and told the waiter to bring coffee, and I brought a glass of fruit to the table too. Then when I came back with my plate, the table was occupied by a family and my things were moved to another table in the corner, and the waiter who was serving the family (very attentively) did not even explain or apologize, just plainly told me that he moved me over to another table. I have never been treated this way before (in the 20 some countries that I have been to, and at similar high end hotels or resorts) and think things do need to improve in Greece.", "title": "Beautiful resort, far from city center", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lizzylizzy", "date": "August 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 117248608}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed there from a Saturday afternoon to Sunday midday for a romantic get-away with my wife.", "title": "Could be a real 5 star experience, let down by typical Greek problems.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "KonNikas", "date": "August 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 117175334}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011", "text": "Their published rates are hugely expensive but bargain hard right through until the time of check-in and you can get some good deals.
