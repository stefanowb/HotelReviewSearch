They seemed to run every 20 to 30 minutes so if you missed one; it is quicker just to walk it. We stayed in a grand master suite which was very nice. Buildings 7 through 12 offer the benefit of new units; they are very spacious. Maid service was very good; they did an excellent job of cleaning our unit every day (including our dishes!) The maids do not speak English, so communication is a bit difficult, although we did manage to explain that our unit did not have a coffee maker and one arrived within 10 minutes.
