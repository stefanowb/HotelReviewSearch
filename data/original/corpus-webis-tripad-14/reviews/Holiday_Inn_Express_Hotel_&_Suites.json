Yes, this is a Holiday Inn Express so there is no bar and the breakfast offering is exactly what you would expect from an Express hotel. If you want a drink, walk across the parking lot to any number of local establishments. How this location performs is the beauty of staying here. It changed my mind as to how high an Express hotel could perform. OK, I would like the pool water a bit warmer, but others would say it is perfect. Are there kids in the pool area, of course, it is a great place for families to stay. The rooms are dead quite, the beds are wonderful, and the staff is extremely friendly and eager to serve. If there was one thing I would like to see changed is that the room AC fan could be left in the \u201con\u201d mode all night.
