The Riad is indeed very beautiful, a peaceful retreat after the frantic hustle and bustle of Marrakech. However the general management of the Riad is poor, the staff,although friendly, are not particularly efficient and the standards of a so called 5 star accommodation just don't match up to expectations. I would advise any visitors to ask prices when ordering drinks as the staff will bring you the most expensive if you don't, and around \u00a38 for a glass of Morrocan wine is no joke! Also ask what is available on the breakfast menu as the buffet is basic but you can order omlettes, however the staff neglect to tell you this when you first arrive. Never sure about what standard of service was on offer and the more fluent your french the better experience you will have at this Riad.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "abbeyorchard", "date": "October 9, 2008", "id": 20762822}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Our party of four returned last weeked having spent a week staying at the fabulous Palais Sebban. As we had booked for 7 nights we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to two luxurious suites, Berbere, with its own private terrace & fountain and Mogadar, overlooking the pool & inner courtyard. The staff are without doubt the most accommodating we have come across in over 30 years of holidaying around the world - nothing was too much trouble and the standards of cleanliness were exceptional. Fortunately as the temperature is so high in July/August we almost had the pool and attentive all to ourselves on certain days. During our viist we saw several meetings designed to promote the Riad in various brochures for next season - our advice would be book early ahead of the crowds and enjoy a very unique experience. The Riad's restaurant also 'undersells ' itself - delicious filet de beouf served differently on two separate evenings. The only drawbacks were the approach via a couple of doubtful back-alleys and I suspect as the Riad will become far busier the bathing facilities may become a little strectched. Having read other trip advisor comments prior to visiting I would suggest the breakfast is more than adequate with the staff happy to oblige with additional dishes such as omelettes and toast. Also at lunchtime they prepared us sandwiches which agian weren't on the menu. Overall excellent facilities which all of us highly recommend.", "title": "An oasis in the chaos that is Marrakech", "user": "MagianWestBerks", "date": "July 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17842895, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff", "disliked": "\u2014 The approach"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This Riad is a architectural gem & worth a visit just for that.
