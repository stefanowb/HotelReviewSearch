When we arrived only one of the three reservations arrived, but luckily they had two extra rooms they booked for us. Rooms were clean and bed was comfortable.

Didn't see any stores or restaurants nearby. Breakfast wasn't supposed to be served until 6 am, however we were catching the shuttle and 4:30 and breakfast was already out. So we did get breakfast, which included bagels, fruit, and juice. I'm sure there was more, but I didn't look closely. The clerk at desk was friendly and accommodating.

One of the negative reviews I saw before my trip has disappeared. It was from a gentleman who had just arrived in his room and could tell things weren't right. I figured his negative review was just a fluke. Big mistake! We arrived after midnight and it was too late to try to find anything else. First, the room was clean and the staff was friendly, but that should be expected anywhere. I did enjoy the shower. My teenage daughter was nervous because of the neighborhood the hotel is in. The beds were small and I have never slept on a more uncomfortable mattress. My mattress at home is pillow top, but nothing too fancy - not Sleep Number, Tempur-Pedic, or anything like that. I could feel the springs poking into me on the mattress at Carlton Inn. About the time I was able to finally get past my discomfort and get to sleep, the ridiculously loud heating/cooling unit would start up. It woke my husband and I up several times in the night. With the shape of the property, the parking was in the middle of all of the rooms, and every time someone else would arrive or depart, the noise would wake me up. I woke up early the next morning and called the hotel office immediately. I was informed that all of the hotel's beds are the same. I got on the phone with Orbitz and made arrangements to check out and get as much of my money back as possible. We stopped by the Carlton's continental breakfast buffet before we left. The donuts were stale and the breakfast sandwich was still frozen. We moved to the Holiday Inn and Suites by O'hare. We got a two-room suite with 2 queen beds for $89 per night. Our rate at Carlton was $137. The Holiday Inn beds were plush and comfy and the bedding was good quality.
