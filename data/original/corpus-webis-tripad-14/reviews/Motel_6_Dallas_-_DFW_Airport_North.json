I'd stayed here with him several years ago and was not happy - he promised me this time would be different since the renovation. I was very pleasantly surprised - only thing I could really find to complain about is the thin towels - rooms are incredibly spotless - and new decor is very functional and actually pretty attractive - clientele is no longer seedy (a lot of commuting airline crew stay here also). All in all, a hell of a deal - someone is doing this one right!! One of nights we were here some sprinkler heads went off and flooded one entire side of first floor and the next morning we saw workers already pulling out the old flooring and putting in new - the management is definitely on top of things here!", "title": "Pretty Unbelievable", "user": "mikesluckywife", "date": "October 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 45739247}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled solo", "text": "Airport shuttle works great also -", "title": "Absolutely terrific value for the money", "user": "JoOcala", "date": "September 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 40202537}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I needed a place just for one night.
