Second, our bill was hand written on a compliment slip itemised as just food, accommodation and drinks. Third, rather than receiving a warm welcome on arrival the owner seemed surprised by our entrance (although she quickly composed herself and found our booking). Fourth, there were used towels from the previous occupant behind the bathroom door. Fifth, the bedroom was superficially clean but not as clean as it should have been.

The new owners of the hotel since October 09 have really put a lot of effort in bringing the hotel up to modern day standards. We spoke to the owner who was a ex business person and clearly must of stayed in a lot of nice 5 star hotels in her time has incorporated these touches into decor and service of the hotel. We stayed in the newly refurbished Loch view room which has a new bathroom very nice decor gone was any hint of Scottish Highland tack. The food in the restaurant was also very good and worth it even if not staying hat the hotel. The had employed a new chef who was using fresh ingredients, my wife thought the salads where great.

The rooms that they have recently redecorated are beautifully done & are warm & relaxing, we cant wait to visit again to check out the rest of the refurbishment which we are sure will be to the same high standard. The bedrooms were very roomy with en-suite bathrooms & the family room was great for us. The meals were good and the owners were great with the kids, adapting the menu if needed to suit the kids taste (we have 1 child who doesnt like chips!!!). The atmosphere in the bar was great & the locals are very friendly & welcoming too. Overall a fantastic family friendly place to stay & we are already planning our next visit.
