It's great that the beach is nearby and there's a busy street with shops, restaurants & supermarkets close by as well, but it's dangerous to walk on this street at night because there's no lighting and buses/cars barely fit the narrow lane and are always threatening to run you over! On our first night, we decided to go get drinks/snacks at the supermarket and walked on the left side of the road which was a big mistake because there's a ditch you can't see in the dark and my husband fell into it while walking! I know it's a fault of the city, not the hotel, but when you put a hotel up somewhere you should do something to get the city to fix this problem! Or at least put up some lights around the hotel.", "title": "Great except for the dark narrow street it's on!", "user": "Scar604", "date": "February 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 56763193}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled solo", "text": "Apart from this scary road making the location less than desireable, I can't complain much.

The hotel was exceptional value for money. Very clean, and great service with a smile. The setting was a hidden away gem down a back alley not too far from the beach, just watch out for the snakes. Staff were on hand to provide local knowledge, tips and tours. The only real negative I could say about this hotel is that the hotel caters very much towards the french and german markets. In general I would recommend this hotel as a cheap, clean and well poisitioned hideway from the hustle and bustle of kuta beach. Boss Boss 1 dollar.
