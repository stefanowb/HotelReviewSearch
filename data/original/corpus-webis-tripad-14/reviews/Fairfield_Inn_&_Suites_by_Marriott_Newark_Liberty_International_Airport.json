Needless to say that when we're suppossed to be enjoying our time off we're to busy worrying about what can go wrong, how we're getting to the airport or if we forgot anything. I was a little skeptical about staying at the Fairfield because i'm a loyal Starwood customer, but a friend recommended it so i gave it a shot. It was great from the start. We decided to do the Park & Fly package, so we drove to the hotel. Well, we were lost for about 20 minutes and decided to call the hotel for directions. The front desk personnel stayed on the phone with us until we were in front of the hotel. After that it was smooth sailing. The Staff was excellent, from the front desk to the breakfast attendants. The rooms were clean, they provided coffee service all hours of the night and they had an indoor pool which tired out our kids which got them to bed nice and early. This is my hotel of choice when flying out of Newark Airport, at least i know i have one less thing to worry about.", "title": "Great Experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "banga07086", "date": "June 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7999324, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Customer service, clean rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 hard to find"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007", "text": "Stayed at this hotel while chaperoning a class trip.
