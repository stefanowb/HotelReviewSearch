We were in town for a cheerleading competition in Disney and were traveling with a young child. We got a great rate of $119/nite. The hotel is situated on a quiet part of International Drive, in an area where there seems to be some new resorts being built. It is adjacent to an outlet mall that you can walk to easily. In addition to the food court at the mall, there is a supermarket and a couple of restaurants across the street. We were tired each day after watching cheerleading and doing the parks, so we just ordered food at the convenient pool bar and relaxed while our child enjoyed the beautiful pool. The room had a fullly equipped kitchen, and if we return we will plan better and do some of our own cooking. One night they showed a kid's movie right next to the pool - our child was in heaven! The room was very spacious, beautiful, very clean, and furnished very nicely. We had a one bedroom unit with a king bed in the bedroom and a full sized pullout in the living room. If you had more people in your group additional bedding might be a problem as there are no rooms with more than one bed. (There was plenty of room for a rollaway , but I don't know if they have them.) Everything looked brand new. We were in building #2 which was the perfect location - very close to the pool without being exposed to the noise. Some of the other buildings are located across a body of water, connected to the rest of the resort with a dock- like walkway. I would not prefer those locations - it's not a really long walk, but we liked being close to the main part of the hotel. There is a pizza place and deli right on property. We had no trouble parking. We never waited for an elevator. The place was immaculate. The staff was friendly. The location was a short drive to Disney and Sea World.

Overall this was a pretty fantastic place for our needs. The hotel's grounds & pool are beautiful and well-maintained. I booked a package through orbitz and got a great rate. After a mix-up with my room, which was supposed to be next to my family, I was upgraded for free to a 1 bedroom suite which was absolutely HUGE and gorgeous--full kitchen & dining area, huge bathroom with jacuzzi and large separate shower, screened in porch. Also arrived around 11am, and they had the room ready to go--impressive. The studio rooms are also nice, but the suite really made the stay and would definitely be worth the extra expense, especially for families. Maid service and amenities were excellent. We were in one of the buildings at the end of the property, by a smaller pool, but a bit of a walk across a bridge over the lake to the main area. We didn't mind, but could be an issue for the older folks. On the plus side, we were located directly next to the gate for the huge outlet mall across the street, which was really a great place to shop. Ate at the food court there a couple times--good selection and fairly cheap for a resort area. There is also an Outback and some fast food within walking distance across the street. The large pool area was also a beautiful area to relax in at the end of the day, ate at the poolside restraunt a couple times which was pretty good.

After acting like their best friend and pressuring them to stay longer, my parents declined to immediately decide to pay the $37,000 time share buy in (not to mention maintence fees, etc). The presenter was extremely rude--shoved his chair back from the table, abruptly jumped up and loudly announced, \"This presentation is OVER.\" Come on--how many people actually agree to spend that much money without thinking it over? It kind of ruined the first day for my mom--she just couldn't get over how rude he was.

The grounds are only glorious and the pool area is one of the most spectacular we have ever seen. The only gripe we had about this lovely place was that there were not enough parking spaces outside each block which meant you had to park outside the main reception area which is about a 10 minute walk from the farthest block.
