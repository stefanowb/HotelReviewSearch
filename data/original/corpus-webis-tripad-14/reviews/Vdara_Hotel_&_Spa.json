The location is great, the rooms were lovely and the front desk staff is totally a pain.

Upon check-in, we were given a handicapped room and told there were no upgrades available. We didn't care for the handicapped room and asked to charge rooms. They accomodated us without problem and we continued to press them about there allegedly being no upgrade available. After the front desk staff \"spoke with his manager\" a corner suite magically appeared. I found the corner suite to be just gorgeous! The bathroom was huge and there were panoramic windows the entire length of the bathroom. It had double sinks, a separate vanity for make-up, a stand up show and a bathtub. The only complaint was there was not a door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom so privacy was a little bit of an issue. The bedroom area was a nice size and also had panoramic windows on two walls. Fortunately the blackout curtains were highly effective at keeping the sun out of the room in the morning. The bed was extremely comfortable. The sitting area and kitchen were very spacious and well equipped. The decor is modern and clean and I really liked it a lot. Upon check-out, the front desk staff unsurprisingly didn't apply any of our dining or bar credits and protested when we told them this. We ended up having to negotiate a final bill which was ridiculous considering we had paper proof of all the credits we were extended.
