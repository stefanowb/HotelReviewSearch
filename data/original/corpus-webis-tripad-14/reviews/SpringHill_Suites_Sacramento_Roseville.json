From the minute you walk in, it's obvious this is not the old-style SpringHill Suites (which are nice in their own right). The lobby area is very chic and modern. Extremely inviting! The rooms are laid out like most SpringHill Suites - a separate living room area with desk, pull out sofa, and wet bar area - but the furnishings are much more modern and sleek! A large LCD TV is a nice high-end touch.", "user": "Calif0rnia_traveller", "date": "February 24, 2009", "id": 25112152}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled with family", "text": "The breakfast is great - both hold and cold items.", "title": "Good but has some minor problems", "user": "AHM", "date": "January 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 23159854, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 New and clean", "disliked": "\u2014 Room noise and temperature"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I'll be staying here on future trips to Roseville and highly recommend it for everyone!", "title": "Really nice experience at this brand new all suites hotel!", "user": "2cents4u", "date": "December 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 22395223, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The cleanliness, friendliness of the staff, the amenities included in the price, especially the breakfast!", "disliked": "\u2014 That there was no door or curtain between the bedroom area and the pull-out couch"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Roseville"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 6, "very good": 27, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 35}, "aka": "Springhill Suites Sacramento Roseville Hotel Roseville", "slim_ranking": 0.444444444444, "description": "Welcome to the SpringHill Suites Sacramento Roseville, where our stylish and smartly designed suites are 25 percent larger than a comparably priced hotel room, giving you room to succeed.
