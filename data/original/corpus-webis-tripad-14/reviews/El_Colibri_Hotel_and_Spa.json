We met friends in the wine bar and had a lovely cheese plate. The wines are all local. Staff were very friendly and helpful.It was my significant other's birthday and staff put rose petals in the room with a bottle of wine I had requested and a lovely note to him confirming his surprise massage. The masseuses were very well trained and a delight to work with. Do the hot rock massage and do 90 minutes. You won't be disappointed. We had dinner at the sea chest to top it all off.

Total silence and no noise could be heard so for light sleepers the back is very quiet - the windows are very well insulated so I would imagine the same is true at the front. Plenty of free parking at the hotel and also free Wifi. Breakfast is ok - its enough to get you started for the day - no hot options mainly cereal, breads, juice, yoghurt, fruit. Lovely beaches/walks/boardwalk 3 minutes from the hotel - turn left when you exit the hotel and you cant miss it. Lovely walks and a nice place to relax. Cute little grey ground squirrels all along the boardwalk which goes on for maybe 2 miles. The hotel is across the road from the town of Cambria which is really in 2 sections - the first part is like a 3-5 minute walk the second part maybe 15 minutes. Everything closes early in both sections of the town. This was our first stop having a lovely drive down from SF so it was great to relax here for 2 nights. The rooms in the hotel are beautiful - very high standards and very new and large. Didn't do the wine tasting as i'm not sure if it was on when we visited. For European visitors expecting big spa facilities they may want to make enquiries but I believe the only spa features are the outdoor Jacuzzi, and a steam room that would burn your feet as its one of those instant steam type ones. Many hotels we visited in California that were spa hotels but they would not have anything like the range of spa services available in European hotels so just be advised of this. It's not a criticism of the hotel as many of the hotels we stayed in had spa's attached with just the same facilities. The jacuzzi in El Colibri is outdoor and open 24 hours I think which is really good. Didn't try any treatments so could not comment. All in all very good and would recommend and would stay again if in this lovely area. One word of thanks to the manager I think his name was Tanu or Tonu - very helpful, friendly and welcoming.", "title": "Very good", "user": "max29", "date": "April 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127431473}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We visited Cambria last week and stayed at El Colibri and even though they allowed pets they are not really pet friendly facility.
