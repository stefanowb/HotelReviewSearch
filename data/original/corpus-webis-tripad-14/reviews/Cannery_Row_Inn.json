Given the price and some reviews we were pleasantly surprised. The room was very clean and comfortable, fireplace, comfortable big bed and fridge in room (empty) and ice maker in the hall. Location excellent and a busy spot. First impression was noisy, but we didn't find this a problem at all. Had breakfast every morning which was decent quality and variety. I would recommend it to friends and stay here again given the price. Free parking was also a big bonus. Bearing in mind that this is an Inn and not hotel I thought it was good value for the area.

The location in Cannery Row allows you to walk anywhere, but it's also on a main street, so we had traffic noises well into the night. The beds were newer and very comfortable with higher end linens. Breakfasts were advertised to begin at 7AM which consisted of coffee. The better breakfast offerings like waffles were not available until after 8 AM.
