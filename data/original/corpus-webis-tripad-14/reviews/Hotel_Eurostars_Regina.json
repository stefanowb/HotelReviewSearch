In fact, we walked ALOT! It was quite a walk to get to the center of anywhere, and after 8 days, it really wore our patience thin. At first we thought it was romantic to walk to town together, but that got old pretty fast. A cab would have been easy, but it would be expensive (7 euros each way, that is 14 euros a day) and for 8 days, it would have gotten expensive. We found the staff to be very helpful. The lobby was very nice, and the buffet breakfast was amazing. It was quite the spread. Our room was 2 double beds stuck together, and it left zero walking space. It was extremely hard for my husband and i do get ready without getting in the way of each other. The walls are super thin, so we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, and above us. There also was some funky smells that filled our room at times. The bathroom was nice, though. It was cleaned and fully stocked daily. The TV had only 2 english channels, and both were news channels (CNN and BBC), which was really anoying (and depressing). Not that we spend alot of time watching tv, but when you come back to the room midday to shower and change before dinner, you sometimes want some down time and like to watch a few minutes of some tv.", "user": "PriscillaWong", "date": "September 28, 2006", "id": 5884661}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Laundry", "text": "Overall, the staff was nice, location was bad, room was way toooo small.

Regarding the walk to the center, the comments are only partially relevant, because you are not obliged to step out the hotel every day and walk to the Cathedral like a robot. Seville starts outside the hotel door: the walk to the Cathedral and the Alcazar is through pretty streets, where you can see the really beautiful houses in which the Sevillans live. Much nearer the hotel is the Alameda de Hercules, a slightly run-down but charming, shady square with caf\u00e9s, where a mostly youngish local crowd hang out in the evenings. The hotel staff are generally friendly (I\u00b4ve had worse service), my room was small but clean and the bathroom very nice and clean (with bidet). The only drawback is the price of a Wifi Internet connection for anyone with a laptop: \u20ac9 for a two-hour connection, and \u20ac22 for 24 hours, which is extortionate. There is an excellent Internet place on the Calle Conde de Barajas, near the hotel (see a map).", "user": "nprmaster", "date": "July 21, 2005", "id": 3689482}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "I recommend it", "text": "I travel to Spain with a group of students every year and we have stayed at the Regina 3 years in a row. The hotel is on San Vincente, a quiet street far from the tourists and noise. That's good and bad, long walks and long waits sometimes for cabs. Avoid rooms by the elevator (103, 203) and those overlooking the courtyard/reception area: it's very noisy. There are two sections to the hotel: as you come in past the reception desk turn right into a causeway which leads into the section with the cafeteria. These rooms are much quieter, and it seems like this section is newer. I stayed in 241, very comfortable. The buffet breakfast costs 11.25 euros but it's worth it: sausage, ham, eggs, breads, deserts, juices, even a diet section. There is also a small bar/cafe as you come in to the left: order the cheese dish for 5 euros, it's enough for two people. They charge 9 euros for two hours of internet use (even if you have wireless), but when you exit the main entrance, go left to the corner, turn left and go a block to the main road: there is an internet cafe there. To get to town turn right as you leave the hotel, walk until the street ends (at the Bellas Artes), turn left, then right at Burger King and keep walking, you'll get to the cathedral eventually. Don't walk during siesta, you'll cook. There's a great little bar with outdoor seating on the corner a couple blocks as you turn right at the entrance: it has some of the best food and cheapest drinks in Seville. It's a great hotel for the price.", "user": "kostasf", "date": "July 13, 2005", "id": 3662444}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very Good Hotel", "text": "Lovely, new hotel with excellent decoration, nice english-speaking staff, full facilities (even wi-fi internet in the rooms) and in convenient location if you have a car, otherwise prepare for a long walk to the town centre.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 31, 2005", "id": 3512350}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Andalucia", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 32, "average": 93, "very good": 202, "terrible": 16, "excellent": 88}, "aka": "Regina Hotel Seville", "slim_ranking": 0.494047619048}
