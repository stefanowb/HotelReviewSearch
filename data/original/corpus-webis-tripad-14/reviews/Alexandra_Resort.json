One thing that is different about the Alexandra compared to many other resorts is that they do not have a resort representative at the airport meeting planes and securing taxis for guests. While this is not a big deal, I did notice that the people who were going to resorts where they had a representative at the airport got taxis a lot faster than I did. Anyway, upon arrival at the Alexandra, a bellman put my luggage on a golf cart, and the reception staff quickly processed my credit card, and I was off to my room. Check-out was efficient too. I didn\u2019t ask for a lot of advice or services during my stay, but the staff were always polite and responsive. What was particularly impressive was that some of the staff were proactive about providing assistance. One thing I did ask the front desk staff to do was to call the Gecko shuttle when I wanted to go somewhere. The process is that the Gecko tells the resort staff when they will arrive, but often what the Gecko driver tells the requester is grossly inaccurate. On several occasions, when the Alexandra staff saw me waiting for the Gecko past the time it was supposed to pick me up, they called the Gecko back without my asking. I really appreciated this, since I didn\u2019t want to bother them to keep calling back, because pretty much everyone knows the Gecko operates on extreme \u201cisland time\u201d (i.e., they tell the resort they will arrive in \u201c10 minutes\u201d, but that can turn out to be anywhere between 10 minutes and one hour in my experience). Other staff (beach, grounds, bellman, housekeeping, and management) were friendly and helpful as well.
