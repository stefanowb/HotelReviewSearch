It is ideally located a block from Paddington Station which makes it easy to get to from Heathrow using the Heathrow Express. It also makes for easy access to the rail and Tube for getting around the rest of London. The Paddington area isn't as nice as some areas of London but we still felt safe walking around even in the evenings. The hotel rooms are not huge by any means but are very clean, have all the basics and are very smartly designed and decorated. The only downside really was that they pump in a vanilla scent into the lobby which while my wife liked made me sneeze like crazy (I actually had to take allergy medicine to keep it under control), but this may not bother other people. The staff were friendly and always smiled and said hello whenever we came and went. We didn't eat at the Phi restaurant in the hotel, but it looked well managed. There are several great places to eat in the nearby area which are cheaper options (for breakfast try Mimo's Cafe next door and for a very nice locals style pub try Victoria's just down the road on Sussex Pl.) The only other con is that recently the prices have seemed to have climbed rather high, in the past I would have rated the hotel a good value, now I would only give it an ok value rating, but overall this is a great place to stay.", "title": "VERY BAD!
