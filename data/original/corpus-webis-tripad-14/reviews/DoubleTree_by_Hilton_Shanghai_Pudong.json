There are no shopping center or resto or a 7-11 near the hotel so the only option is to dine inside the hotel. The bfast spread was not good. Congee and some preserved veggies only but no dimsum or soybean milk for chinese guest. The fried noodles sucks. The entrees (ham, bacon, sausage, etc) were few and the wait staff was only 3. Not a good deal for a US$138/room/night/bfast/net. Location wise it sucks, F&B needs a lot of improvement.

I'd stayed in another hotel operated by this French-owned chain and was quite pleased with this development. On checking in, I was offered an upgrade which, for an added Y400 per night included the standard executive package of buffet breakfast (very nice), broadband Internet, one free piece of laundry per day, an open bar happy hour with ample noshes from 6 to 8 each evening, and a very spacious suite on a non-smoking, upper floor with an incredible view of the Pudong skyline. I've stayed in hotels with rooms smaller than this suite's entrance foyer, which even had its own half-bath. Service was superb throughout. The one potential drawback is that the hotel is not in a major business, shopping or tourism district either in Pudong or in Shanghai across the river. Taxis are cheap, but the drivers invariably offer an unpleasantly thrilling race through dense traffic. Curled up in a defensive fetal position in the backseat of a taxi is not the best way to enjoy the scenery. Fortunately, the Lan Cun Road subway station is a block away down the street running perpendicular to the front of the hotel. (Unlike subways elsewhere, Shanghai's system is clean, new, efficient, well air-conditioned and has lots of signs and announcements in English. The ticket machines are even bi-lingual.)
