The Holiday Inn Silom is situated quite centrally with short walks to the sky-train (one stop to central pier on the river) and shopping centres and markets. Although there was some rennovation work being done during our stay, this took place during the day when we were out so did not affect us. Our room was excellent - modern with all the usual facilities you would expect. The breakfast was comprehensive and of high quality, and as it was not inluded in our room we were offered a deal for braekfast which I though was reasonable if not a bit on the high side, but as I said the quality was very good. We also ate in the restaurant which was also of a high standard, but if you are on a budget there is the Silom Village with lots of good quality places to eat only a couple of minutes outside the hotel.
