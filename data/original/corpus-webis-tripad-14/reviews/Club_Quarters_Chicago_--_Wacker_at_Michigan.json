It is an excellent location just across the river from the much more expensive mega hotels. This smaller boutique hotel has smallish rooms and is merely a nicely furnished, liveable scale place. It has the advantage of being near breakfast shops and convenience stores but also close to the Trump Hotel and Sheraton, Hyatt and Hilton for the conventions that regularly use Chicago's Magnificent Mile neighborhood shopping and energy for clients and convention parties. This small hotel is built in an older office building. Rooms are in the heart of Chicago and close to everything. The check in was fast and efficient, check out was great and service was handled well. Overall, great value and highly professional stay for business or leisure on a getaway. Go elsewhere if you want more space or better views, or have ideas of a vacation for coupes or kids.
