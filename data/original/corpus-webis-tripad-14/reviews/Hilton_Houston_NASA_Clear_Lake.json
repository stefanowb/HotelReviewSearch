We had a great view overlooking the lake. The room were very nice. We enjoyed the pool and would have enjoyed the onsite water activities had we had more time. I would recommend spending the little extra to get a room with a view, because we found it to be very relaxing. We liked it so much we are going to make it a once a year tradition.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 29, 2005", "id": 3508248}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Good location, not much else", "text": "I've stayed here many times over the past 6 years on business trips to NASA.

My daughter left a CD (autographed) in our room and I have contacted the hotel 4 times but I still have to hear from them.
