We just returned last night.I was careful to read all the reviews both before and after I made my reservation. I am so glad we chose the FACGB. It was super. I have no complaints. From the check in to the check out everything went perfectly. We did not do the Grand Club nor did we stay in one of the huge suites. We had the Ocean View Mini Suite. This was perfect for us. Upon our arrival we were greeted by a wonderful staff and led to our room where there was a bottle of champagne (our anniversary) awaiting us. The food was great the pool was warm..the pool bar(s) were great. I will stay there again and I highly recommend this fabulous hotel to anyone.", "title": "Heaven on Earth", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ennaejb", "date": "July 29, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 2329714}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Absolutely love it!!", "text": "This is our 3rd visit to FAGCB.

My kids are ages 14 & 9. When we arranged our vacation through AAA our travel agent advised that this hotel required that we book 2 rooms because my son was 14 so he was considered an \"adult\" for booking purposes. I was ok with that figuring the extra space & 2 bathrooms would be nice. Upon check in however, we could not get 2 adjoining rooms or even 2 rooms on the same floor although this had been requested on our booking. The check in clerk said there were no adjoining rooms available even after I offered to upgrade to the club level. She (Carmen) was totally unhelpful. When I asked to speak with a manager she simply replied that none were available however she kept going into the back office (offering no explanation for her disappearance). Also, although we were checking in around 4:30 they only had one room available and we were told we would have to check back for the 2nd room. Overall the check in process took 45 minutes with a net result of 1 room immediately and they would call when the 2nd room on a different floor was ready. I finally relented on the floor situation as I did not want to spend alot of my vacation time arguing with the hotel clerk and as it turned out my sister was planning on joining us and she stayed in the other room with the kids. If this was not the case however, I would have found the 2 rooms on different floors to be unacceptable.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 9, 2004", "id": 2430845}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach-AMAZING!", "text": "That was the downside of staying at this hotel.

The service there was really slow and the rest of us had finished eating while my daughter was still waiting for her order from the kids menu. Tired of waiting we finally got up to leave and told the waiter we were going to the market down the street to get my daughter a snack. They then apologized and did not charge us for our dinner.

We had 2 rooms and at $80 per night for each room it was not a good fit for our family.This was due largely in part as we could not eat $160 in snacks or drinks. Also we heard a group of 20 somethings at the pool say how easy it was to walk into the Grand Club and eat and drink without having to pay for the service, \"They don't even ask what room you are in\" , we heard them say.
