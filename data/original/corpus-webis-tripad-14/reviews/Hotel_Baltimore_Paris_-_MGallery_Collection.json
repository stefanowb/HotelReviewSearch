When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that all the connecting rooms were sold out but that we had been given superior rooms. I told the receptionist that I didn't give a damn about superior rooms but I did wanted connecting rooms as per my booking. She replied that all those rooms were sold out since midday so I'd better not bother her with discussion, Again I specified that connecting rooms were confirmed in the booking and again she repeated not to bother her with discussion. At this point I walked out the door, took my car, drove around the neighbor and found a wonderful hotel with connecting rooms. I went back to the Baltimore, canceled the booking without paying an euro (and they didn't say a word about it), greeted them and told them they would never see us again.", "title": "Rude rude staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "eli014", "date": "November 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 87998996}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed in this hotel this summer and I really enjoyed it!

The room is bright with a really nice balcony facing Kleber Av and the bed is very comfy! Most hotels in Paris have small beds, but this one was a king size bed! The bathroom is ok but I found the tub too high for some people to step over comfortably. Hotels in Paris are overpriced and are not as nice as this one! It worth staying in!

What cleanliness is concerned the rooms get a definite minus though. The bathroom was plainly filthy and unacceptable for a \u20ac250 charge per night.
