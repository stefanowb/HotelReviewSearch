Colin and Karen are excellent hosts who go our of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcome. They provided lots of useful information on the local area and their recommendations for restaurants etc were spot on. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated with a lovely outlook. The bathrooms are modern with very good fittings and lovely big bath or large shower. The breakfasts are excellent with a great choice ranging from continental to full English breakfast or scrambled eggs and smoked salmon (my favourite). Lots of little extra services are offered such as washing and wi fi. I would have no hesitation in recommending this Bed and Breakfast to anyone visiting the area - we loved staying here and would love to visit again.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DebJD", "date": "August 24, 2008", "id": 19310298}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed two nights at the Highland View whilst on honeymoon in Scotland.
