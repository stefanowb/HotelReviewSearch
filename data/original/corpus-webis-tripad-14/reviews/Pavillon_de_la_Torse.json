Most websites tend to overstate their features or omit things they don't want you to know. In this case, Marie and Francois have very modestly understated the beauty of this home, the fluffy linens, the individually decorated rooms, the comfortable library, the amazing park-like setting, the wonderful breakfast service, and on and on. Guests should not miss the 6:30 cocktail hour. This isn't just drinks and snacks, this is a hosted gathering of guests giving one an opportunity to meet interesting people from around the world and just visit in a delightful settting. We were interested to find that the conversations from the night before would frequently pick up again over breakfast. The hosts offer free internet service and free worldwide telephone service via VOIP. This is clearly a \"first\" in our experience. Another \"first\" is the use of the laundry facilities on the property. Included in our welcome package was a list of recommended restaurants in the area. We tried several and weren't disappointed. Marie and Francois are also very happy to suggest short day trips outside of Aix, and as with the restaurant recommendations, they didn't disappoint. The property has a magnificent swimming pool and sunbathing area and also backs on to a large public park which is convenient for walking or jogging. As we drove away, we felt that we had just spent a week with friends in their lovely home.
