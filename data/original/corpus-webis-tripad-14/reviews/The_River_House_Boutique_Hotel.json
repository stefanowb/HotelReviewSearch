The last available room was no. 5 (Fels) and as it seems to be bigger than the others it was also quite expensive (just above SF 300!). We liked the size and warm interior design of the room, but there isn't any furniture to put away your things -no problem for just two nights in summer, but what do you do while on a skiing holiday?!. The bathroom, with a huge and nicely done bathtub in the corner, is beautiful, but not practical. I personally would have preferred a door to the bedroom... When I opened the bathroom window I looked immediately into the eyes of the waitress and the customers on the bar terrace, which is just next to this room on the same level.
