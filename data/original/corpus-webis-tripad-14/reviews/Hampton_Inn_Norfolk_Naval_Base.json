Staff was incredibly friendly, helpful and accommodating. High-five to Helen and Dominic! Unfortunately, the hotel itself is in desperate need of renovation. Though it appears that public areas have been upgraded, the rooms leave much to be desired. Upon walking into the room, I was greeted with the pungent smell of mildew. The room seemed stale and without proper ventilation. The mattresses were lumpy and in need of replacement, and the bedding held a faint odor as well. Sadly, the hotel windows didn't open. Lighting was poor, making it very difficult to utilize the work desk for much more than a luggage stand. The carpet was sprinkled with stains and had an overall darkened color, like it was weighted down with ground-in dirt. Thankfully, the bathroom was roomy and well lit, with plenty of bath linen.
