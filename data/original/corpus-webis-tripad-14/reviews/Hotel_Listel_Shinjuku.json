Was cheap by tokyo standards, near the bars/clubs of shinjuku and very much a 'local area'. The hotel itself was great for singletravellers. Its small compact, but very clean and fairly modern. All tv channels were in japanese but was too busy exploring tokyo instead! Make sure you ask for a room in the main building and not the annexe part. The main thing that this hotel fell down on was service. I expereinced great hospitaility everywhere i went in tokyo (even if they didnt speak english!) but the staff in this hotel were very un-friendly and not wishing to help. I arrived at the hotel at 10am but the room wasnt ready until 2pm. I was made to wait as were all the other guests. Then suprisingly enough right on 2pm ALL the rooms suddenly became available! Miraculous! You can pay extra to check in early, and i would have done but for the way they went about it. Brisk 10-15 min walk to the main shinsuku station which is a great platform from which to explore tokyo.", "user": "qprjames", "date": "April 16, 2008", "id": 15071608}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location", "text": "Oh and dont bother paying extra for breakfast.

Stall but comfortable. No closet, just a hook that can hang about 5 items. Few TV Channels, none in English. Typical small Japanese bathroom. However, all very functional, and great value for Tokyo, and awesome location walking distance to Shinjuku. When to arrive at Shinjuki Station, just take a taxi for 660 Yen, don't try to find if your first trip to Tokyo. However, once there, easy to get around and great location to shopping, night life etc! I would absolutely recommend and stay there again. Breakfast was buffet style, mostly Japanese but eggs, toast and Japanese ham/bacon available. Inluded in price. Noon \"late check out\" included with a two night stay. P.S. A/C worked fine, and I slept great!", "user": "DLCharactr", "date": "September 24, 2006", "id": 5833383}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fantastic value, good location!", "text": "I chose this hotel because I found a couple of reviews on the web that said it was a decent hotel. Although the room was typical for Japanese standards (very clean, small, hard bed, toilet that squirts warm water), the overall experience was uninviting. The worst thing for me is the 10:00 am check out time. When I'm on vacation, that's usually the time I wake up. And at 10:02 that day, I got a call from the front desk that it was check out time and I needed to come down now.", "user": "Boop2", "date": "August 29, 2005", "id": 3813267}], "location": {}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 13, "average": 72, "very good": 101, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 15}, "aka": "Hotel Listel Shinjuku Tokyo", "slim_ranking": 0.608695652174, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 3.5, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 3.5}}
