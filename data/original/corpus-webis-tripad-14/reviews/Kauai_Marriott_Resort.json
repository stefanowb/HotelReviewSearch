They offer a mug that is very tall(12oz) for $39.95 with all the refills you want. For a 14 day stay this more than paid for itself. You can also request a toaster, larger refrigerator(dorm size) and a microwave. If you have a car, Walmart is easy to find. I strongly urge you to purchase your drinks, bread, lunch meats, butter for toast, condiments and snacks to save money.

It rained somewhere on the island everyday out of 10 but particularly got washed out 1 entire day, 2 other half days...but that's the luck of the draw isn't it. Vog was a problem. That's right Vog. Been to HI 4 previous times and never heard of it until now. Something to do with lack of trades. Blocked some of the views. Snorkeling was OK in Hanalei at Tunnels (better in Maui & Oahu). Surfing was excellent along North Shore (3-6 HI feet) but again luck of the draw in May and for the experienced only. 1 decent hike near NaPali for the less adventurous (though still fairly strenous) but I am told several more back along this coast for the prepared (camping, trekking...that sort of thing).
