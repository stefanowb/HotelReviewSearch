Great to receive a cold towel and a fruit punch cocktail whilst checking in. Room was big and spacious, but yeah a bit worn around the edges, but how much time do you spend in your room. Pool was clean with sun loungers around it, plenty of sun loungers on the beach, but beware....the towel gestapo were in full force on putting towels on sun beds at yes 06:30hrs ....I thought I could beat them at 0700hrs but no. This was the English doing this and many didn't turn up till midday or not at all. Shade was precious, specially at midday. I have been to a couple of hotels were you have to check your towels in and out daily and they assign you a sunbed and mark it on a plan...maybe this could be adopted by the Halycon Cove...?", "title": "Pure Relaxation.........Bliss", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "courtod", "date": "March 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126458787}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Food was good, with a good choice for everyone.
