The villa was large and spacious with separate bed and lounge area and several balconies to sit on and direct access via stairs to the beach. However ours (no 300) didn't get much sun throughout the day. We also had a beachfront bungalow no 112 which was direct onto the beach infront of the others and 10m walk to the sea. We spent most of our day on this balcony! Mossies are a pain and the hotel fogs and provides DEET. Yes there are plenty of sea cucumbers but wear the reef shoes available from the bar and forget them. The lagoon is shallow and the coral reef provides plenty of fish life to see. Having been, the beachfront bungalow is all you need. Restuarant and local night are reasonable value but the whole resort isn't cheap, but what a beautiful setting. The view of the reef lagoon is enough to set you up for the day and makes the bill that much more palateable.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "watchitLondon", "date": "September 9, 2007", "id": 8681459}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Definitely do the Kia orana cruise ;small boat 10 people max, for a stunning day out.

The beach was amazing, and you're right on it. The views are spectacular, really once in a lifetime job! However, that's what we were expecting because that's what we paid for. The first few days were lovely, the staff were friendly, the food was amazing, and the rooms were lovely. Unfortunately, we had one problem, and it was a big problem that ruined out honeymoon to an extent - cockroaches. We could handle the little lizards and big spiders that we came across in our room occassionally, but not the cockroaches. They seemed to have infested our room. We came across them running up the wall, across the ceiling, in the bathroom - little ones, medium sized ones, and giant ones. The locals thought that this was totally normal, and the management talked about sorting it out. But after every major psticide spray - they just kept on coming back! We recieved no apology, or any acknowledgement of the severity of the problem. The irony was that we specifically choose this resort based on previous reviews from trip advisor saying that it was cockroach free as compared to Fiji/Tahete/etc.", "title": "Such a dissapointment!!!!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Frank H", "date": "August 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8347961, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 It was awesome", "disliked": "\u2014 Mozzies and Sea Slugs"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "my husband and i spent our honeymoon here and found the pacific resort to be pure bliss! our beachfront bungalow was perfect, quite roomy and the service was excellent. the staff was at our every call and even delivered our room service dinner in courses! i would highly reccomend this amazing resort to anyone looking for a romantic and beautiful place to spend their time in the cook islands.", "title": "a true fantasy - perfect in all ways.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "kategr", "date": "May 14, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7616709}], "location": {"country": "Cook Islands", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 13, "very good": 48, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 543}, "aka": "Pacific Resort Aitutaki Hotel Aitutaki", "slim_ranking": 0.2, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "An intimate collection of 27 secluded hideaways with absolute beach frontage while set amongst lush,palm filled gardens for privacy.
