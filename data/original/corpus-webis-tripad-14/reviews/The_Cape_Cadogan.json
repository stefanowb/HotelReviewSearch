I arrived late in the evening, and had pre-arranged for a meal to be delivered to my room. All arrangements handled promptly and perfectly. I stayed in one of the separate apartments in the block behind the main house. Very nice accomodations - just a short walk to the main house for morning breakfast, which was delicious. Loved eating on the terrace by the small pool. The staff behind the desk were always very helpful to arrange tours for me, dinner reservations, and even provide assistance in securing my packed goods to take home! Location is great - not far from the Mount Nelson Hotel. Nice restaurants nearby. Table Mountain in the background.
