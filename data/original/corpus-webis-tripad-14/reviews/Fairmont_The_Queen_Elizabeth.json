The woman walked away and shortly returned, saying we could have a renovated room (usually $199) for $149. I should say so! I've never heard of a hotel trying to raise the rate of a credit-card-guaranteed reservation. Not what I wanted to hear after a nine-hour drive.

The Lobby was out of this world. The hotel is an excellent location nearby to almost everything you need, even the nightlife. However the rooms were disappointing they were clean but very small and certainly not worth the amount we paid. In fact we paid considerably less in Ottawa for a 3* hotel and it was far more luxurious than the Fairmont. Service was friendly but they allocated us a room that was already occupied. They did allocate us another room after we had disturbed the current occupant and then kindly charged us for the service a day or so after we checked out of the hotel. Again they did refund the charge after we complained.

The location of the hotel is very convenient for walking around downtown and old Montreal. The hotel is not particularly attractive from the outside. I understand that 2/3rds of the floors have been updated and those rooms cost more. I stayed in an older room which was ok, not great, bed was comfortable, bathroom was fine and clean, very nice view of the large church adjacent. Depending on the rate you can get, this is a good choice of hotel. There are some new boutique style hotels in Old Monteal that are very nice, but pricy. Also, this hotel is very convenient to the underground city and central train station and metro stations, you don't have to go outside at all if you don't want to. I ate at the Beaver Club restaurant in the hotel, it was one of the best meals I have ever had and I have eaten at some very nice places. The fixed price 6 course meal paired with regional wines was absolutely fantastic, with impeccable service, incredible local ingredients were used mostly and I cannot praise the Beaver club enough, absolutely first class, you cannot get better food anywhere.
