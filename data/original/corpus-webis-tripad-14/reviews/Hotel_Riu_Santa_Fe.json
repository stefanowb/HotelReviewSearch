We booked through Jubilee Travel in Vancouver and we did not receive any instructions for our transport from the airport to the hotel. In Cabo this proved to be very important. Once you depart your plane, collect your baggage and clear customs you will come out to a large room lined with many desks and workers wearing bright coloured shirts. They all look very official and have badges but they are all working for timeshares. If you ask them they will tell you that they are with whatever tour company you say you are looking for. When you go through the next set of doors you will encounter the same thing. Once outside of the airport you will find the REAL transfers. Had someone explained this to us we may not have missed our transfer. As it was it turned out fine.

It was clean and the decor is very contemporary. The king bed could have used an extra pillow (4 instead of 3) and the bed was a bit too firm for me. The safe is way too small for a laptop and I would be surprised if it could fit an iPad. I have a 13\" Macbook and there is no way it would fit so I was happy to have read previous reviews about this. The balcony has a clothes rack to dry off your bathing suits which is nicer than hanging them off a chair or the railing. The toiletries are pretty much non existent.
