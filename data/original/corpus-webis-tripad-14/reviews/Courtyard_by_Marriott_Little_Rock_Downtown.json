The servers will bring a carafe of coffee to the table which eliminates the necessity of trying to flag down the server for a refill.

I was impressed with the new room design and really hope this will be the new room set up for all future courtyards. The bedding was on par with a 4 star hotel and not the old \"apartment rental style\" furniture where the sheets slide off the bed when you sit down. The main wall in the room was a long desk that also offered a place for the coffee maker and fridge along with designer lighting. This location was great (you can walk to shops, eats, the riverfront and the Clinton Library)and the staff was friendly. There was a charge for parking and this courtyard does not offer the free breakfast found at other courtyards.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 27, 2005", "id": 4305943}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice hotel, great location", "text": "We stayed at this hotel the nights of September 17th & 18th.
