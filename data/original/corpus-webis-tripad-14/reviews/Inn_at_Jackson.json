We have stayed at many Bed and Breakfasts (as well as nicer hotels), as we do a lot of traveling. We can say - unequivocally - that the Inn at Jackson is PERFECT! First, it's very clean (that's always our major concern). The location is great; not right in the hustle and bustle of North Conway, but just a few minutes outside the tourist spots. We love mountain hiking, and the Inn is close to Mount Washington and other natural attractions in the White Mountains. The Breakfasts were wonderful - considering both quality and quantity. We had ours served up at our room for a few mornings, which was a nice touch. However, the downstairs 'communal' breakfast was great, too, as there are separate small tables for each guest party if you don't like being forced eating with everyone at the B&B. Don, the Innkeeper, was friendly and knowledgeable about the area, as you'd expect. But he made the extra effort to try and think of ways to customize our visit based on our unique set of circumstances, which we greatly appreciated. Good restaurants nearby, incredible views, and a great massage at Moondance. The Inn at Jackson deserves its reputation - it's absolutely perfect.
