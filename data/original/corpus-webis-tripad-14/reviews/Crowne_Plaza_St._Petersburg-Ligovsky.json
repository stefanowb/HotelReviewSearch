I walked in late after a horrible experience elsewhere and was therefor unable to speak to reservations about the length of stay I really needed, but the very friendly and helpful girl behind the reception desk did her best to find me a room for the first night that had no reservation marked against it on the computer system for the time I wanted. The room was very nice, if a only little cramped, but had a nice modern TV, comfortable bed, coffee making facilities and a nice big shower and sink in the bathroom. I had a room facing out the back of the hotel and while the view was pretty awful really, at least it was nice and quiet; I'm unsure what the rooms facing towards the major shopping center and metro would be like. Had excellent black out curtains and good air-conditioning - a must while traveling during Saint Petersburg's summer white nights. Room service was great, but expensive, but then where is room service not over priced? Laundry service is available but the price is ridiculous. The location is ok, but it depends on what you have come here to see, if you have come to see the main sites like St Isaac's, Peter and Paul's fortress and The Winter Palace/Hermitage etc, your best best would be to find something further west on Nevsky as its a bit of a hike. The one and only real disappointment was the fact that internet access incurred an extra charge (about $20 a day) and a network cable is needed. All in all I would stay here again, but would split my time up between here and somewhere further west for ease of access to everything this wonderful city has to offer.", "title": "Good location but pricey buffet breakfast!", "user": "Tyrone64", "date": "June 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 131659940}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The staff, especially the front desk manager who checked us in are so nice.
