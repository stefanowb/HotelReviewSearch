The hotel building is an old granite pile of 3 stories like so many of the Brittany seaside villas. It has been decorated with great charm and nautical style (residents of Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard would feel very much at home). Rooms are comfortable with a nice, homey feel and the downstairs sitting rooms actually feel like a private seaside home. Add to all this traditional charm, a modern wooden deck and a fun restaurant serving all manner of seafood and a view of sailboats in the harbor and you have the makings of a perfect, relaxing seaside retreat.", "title": "Nautical charm and style", "user": "FloridaTravelmum", "date": "August 6, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36915628}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007", "text": "Breakfasts (not included in the lodging price but worth the extra charge) on the deck overlooking the harbor and watching the young kids take off for their sailing lessons were a real treat and a great way to start a day. We like nothing better than seaside villages of charm with just enough activity to hold your interest. La Trinite sur Mer furnishes all of that (and some pretty good shopping and dining options) and Petit Hotel des Horensias is the perfect place to stay in order to soak it all in. Natalie, the manager, saw to our comfort and seemed like a friend or neighbor stopping in to visit us in our own seaside villa.
