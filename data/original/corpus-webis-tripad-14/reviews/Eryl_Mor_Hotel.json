This hotel is in 2 buildings .. we stayed in the building next door, It was a very nice looking hotel with great views across the sea. Unfortunately the room we was given was a family room on the ground floor at the back ... room 17, this room was adequate for an evening stay. It was clean and comfortable, a little dated and could do with a facelift .. new carpets, doors etc ... ceilings and bathroom in 'our room' could do with a lick of paint as mould/damp was showing, and the bathroom tiling could do with a regrout!! The TV was a tv/dvd ... which is what was stated on the hotel room description, as we were travelling with 2 children ages 8 and 9 they wanted to take a couple of dvds for the evening, however due to the placing of the tv .. dvds could not be put into the machine ...it was a side loader and there was a permanant shelf right next to the wall mounted tv .. hence not able to load a dvd, children were disappointed, but by the time we got back to the room at 9.30pm it was a bit late anyway!! We did not have an evening meal at the hotel, however, due to prior arrangements, the menu looked very good, and prices are what you would expect to pay. Breakfast was very nice and plentiful .. the children opted for cereal, yoghurt and melon, my husband and I had a full breakfast .. very nice indeed. My overall opinion is .. it is a nice hotel, in a nice part of Bangor, walking distance to the town centre, I would definately recommend this Hotel .. and we will more than likely stay again ... however would request a seaview room if available.", "title": "lovely location", "user": "JegeT", "date": "February 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 151752158}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This is a good hotel with friendly staff (though the waitress at breakfast was a bit stern).

We had rooms above us and occassionally you could hear people walking around, but nothing significant. Great views if you have a room overlooking Menai Strait.

The staff were very pleasant except for one surly young woman who served breakfast. She actually made me feel a nuisance. The hotel looks and is shabby. the first view of it reminded me of Norman bates house in 'Psycho'. The bedroom that I had was tiny and shabby. The bathroom was small but looked new. The only part of the hotel that did! I have a problem walking and there are absolutely no disabled facilities whatsoever! Firstly the car park', which is on the road, is at the bottom of a long flight of steps and you have to lug your luggage up them. The reception and bar areas are extremely shabby and unwelcoming. I had to climb up five flights of narrow, steep, stairs to my room which was in the first building. if you are unlucky enough to be in the building further up the hill then you have more external flights of steps to climb up and then even more narrow stairs inside. The breakfast was OK except for the surly young woman and I only paid \u00a340 for B & B. My colleague and I took one look at the empty restaurant and went into Bangor to look for somewhere better but that was not easy!

When we went to the so called restaurant for breakfast, the waitress was wiping the table opposite us with a cloth so filthy you wouldn't wash the floor with it, and the bits went straight on to the floor, she then set the table up again placing clean cutlery onto the plastic tablecover she'd wiped with the dirty cloth.We ordered our breakfast although the episode with the cloth left me not wanting to eat it, and when it arrived I definitely didn't want to eat it - it was all deep fried (apart from the beans) even the bacon, just too greasy.Having said that,there are cereals, yogurt, fruit juice etc. if you want it.
