We were not the easiest guests. We rented a larger cabin for my mother in law and ended up with three mini-cabins. We made and cancelled and changed reservations up until and even after some of us had checked in. All changes were accepted with a smile and the feeling that I was working with a good friend and not with someone i'd never met. We were given heaters for the cooler nights and even had a birthday cake and flowers in the cabin when we checked in. The cabins are comfortable and close enough/far enough from each other to be able to enjoy the evenings with close friends yet have complete privacy. The customer service at the Coast Village Inn and Cottages is EXCEPTIONAL and was MUCH APPRECIATED. I will never stay anywhere else in Wells and highly recommend this property.", "title": "Love this place - and the staff!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JSGidney", "date": "November 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 85654404}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Coast Village Inn is a great place to stay while exploring the south Maine coast.

A few things though i'd point out. Though I am sure the bed sheets had been cleaned, there were a bunch of hairs (5 or 6) between the covers. I am guessing it was probably from whoever made the bed. Not a huge deal, but you know...Also, the kitchen didn't have a microwave. I expected that a cottage that mentions it has a \"fully equipped kitchen\" would've had a microwave - notwithstanding the fact that the property sign in front listed \"microwaves' as the first feature. (I will note that the lady at the front desk was nice and told my husband she'd try to get one for us, but I guess it didnt work out because we never heard anything back - nice of her to try nonetheless). The unit also did not have an electric coffee maker - they did offer coffee in the front office, but would've been a nice little feature to have (at the low cost of cheap coffee makers and microwaves nowadays, seems it would be worth the investment). Also, the water was a bit of a pain. For the hot water to come on, you would have to run the water for quite a while, and when it finally did kick in, it was pretty difficult to adjust the temperature.
