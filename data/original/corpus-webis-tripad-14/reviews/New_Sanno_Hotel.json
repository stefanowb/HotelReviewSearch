Once we got inside we went to the desk to check in. I had booked on the hotel's website and marked the box for NO ROOM SUBSTITUTIONS. Well they ignored my request and now we were stuck in a room with one bed for the 4 of us. I was not very happy and extremely tired. So we figured we would make do versus going out into Tokyo at night to try and find another room. We get into our room which was more like a motel room, and order room service. It took 45 minutes for room service to arrive so in the mean time I got ready for bed, pulled back the sheets to find several large hair balls in our ONE bed! That was the final straw for me.

So we showed up there with our suitcases just to be rejected at the gate. Apparently it is only for american soldiers active and retired.

Well appointed decor, excellent staff, and great price/value. Convenient location for doing all the touristy things available in Tokyo. The hotel has a Tours Desk to help you decide what to do during your stay. The dining opportunities available at the hotel range through a large gamut: A breakfast coffee/pastry snack bar, a traditional style sandwich snack bar, a coffee shop style dining room, a Japanese restaurant and culminate at an elegant gourmet dining room with ala carte or fixed price offerings. The fixed price menu offers some rather exotic choices and is very reasonably priced at slightly less than $50.00 per adult. This is a very enjoyable dining experience. On Sunday an all you can eat buffet for less than $25.00 per adult is available. One day laundry/dry cleaning is available through room service plus a well maintained coin operated laundry facility in the basement. DVD movies are available through the desk at a minimal charge. Cautions!!! Taking the train/subway from the Narita airport to the hotel is a cultural experience but it involves lots (No, Really! Lots) of stairs climbing at some stations. Take the bus (see the hotel site for info) as it offers basically door to door convenience and is also quite a bargain at about $30.00 per person. Taking a taxi from the airport to the hotel or anywhere in the downtown Tokyo area costs approximately $250.00 - one way!!
