This place exceeded all of my expectations. Each room is uniquely designed and is decorated with antiques, Mexican crafts, and tile and ceramic work which the state of Puebla is known for, which are all available for sale. There were little pieces of history throughout the hotel; in fact the heavy wooden door to our bathroom supposedly originated from an old colonial jail. I opted for a honeymoon suite, which had a balcony that overlooked a cobblestone avenue lined with colonial buildings. At sunset the entire street would be cast in an orange glow, as the bells from the Catedral nearby rang and echoed. I loved that this hotel has it's own personality and spirit, as I am not a fan of large corporate hotels where every room looks the same.", "title": "A place with soul and character", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DawgHouse78", "date": "February 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 25344827}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled with family", "text": "The staff was more than accommodating (and extremely patient) with us.

They were also extremely patient with us when we woke up late on the day of our departure and didn't check out until after the appointed check out time (a corporate hotel would have nailed us with a charge, or charged us for another night entirely for being late). Since we got the honeymoon suite, our package included breakfast, and I loved the chilaquiles with verde sauce.
