The rooms were a decent size, but very clean and cozy. Our room also had a balcony which was great to relax after the beach.

Free parking space no more than 1/2 block away. Free wireless Internet access. Full range of cable TV channels. The room size is definitely as advertised -- \"modest\" -- so one isn't going to want to hang out in the room a great deal (especially with active kids), but that's what the beach is for. There is a table that functions as the TV stand with a refrigerator and microwave next to it. You can hear comings & goings of others, but the loud fan from the window a/c works well to cover most of that.", "title": "A good option for an Ocean City visit", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "consultant007", "date": "August 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 36603112}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Ocean City"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 10, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 31}, "slim_ranking": 0.111111111111, "description": "The King Charles Hotel invites you to relax and enjoy your summer vacation in our clean, comfortable and friendly hotel.
