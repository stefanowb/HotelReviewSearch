The bathroom is beautiful and very spacious and modern. Air conditioner works perfect. The lobby also is very unique and modern, I loved the atmosphere and colors. The front reception upon check in was swift, friendly and very accommodating. There was also an outdoor garden/courtyard area that is beautiful and looks very inviting. In the lobby breakfast area are little pods with televisions which would be wonderful with children during breakfast meals. The only two drawbacks were the pool is very small so if I had my children it would be disappointing to them. Also I was quite surprised to see that although the breakfast area is nice, you have to PAY for breakfast. It was only my husband and I so it was inexpensive; however if I were traveling with my children I would have been shocked. I am used to courtyard Marriots being continental breakfast free of charge. I feel unless it is a full fledge restaurant on site that we should not have to pay for breakfast on top of hotel fees. The staff at the breakfast bar were not very friendly, unlike the front desk staff who were very friendly. Also at 8am they were out a few things on their limited menu.

We have tried nearly all of the hotels in Bangor, especially all of the hotels closer to the airport, on Odlin Road. I am very impressed with this property in both terms of the service received and overall comfort/cleanliness. First, service was wonderful from check-in to checkout. The staff was the most pleasant that I have encountered in all of my stays in Maine. They were always smiling and easy to converse with. Our room was great, without any concern whatsoever. The bright d\u00e9cor and sharp design give the room a trendy feel. Many hotels in the Bangor area are stuck in the 1980s with their room d\u00e9cor; this is not the case with the Courtyard. The bed offered a nice sleep with plenty of pillows. Each room is equipped with internet access. Not once did we think about dirt, as the room (and bathroom) was spotless. The lobby is spacious with a trendy feel. It certainly would be welcoming to the business traveler for those quick meetings or to find a place to socialize with coworkers. The lobby offers plenty of spots to kick back and relax or to catch the big game. Next to the check-in desk is \u201cThe Market\u201d, a signature amenity of the Courtyard properties. The Market is a 24-hour pantry, offering snacks and beverages and other items that you may need during your stay. Another central feature in the lobby area is the Bistro. The Bistro offers a small food menu as well beverages. Alcoholic beverages such as bottled beer cost between $4-$5 while a glass of wine cost between $7-$9\u2026 price right to avoid making the lobby into a bar. Guest can find complimentary coffee in the lobby as well, and a full service business area with computers with internet and printers access. The hotel offers onsite laundry service (coin-operated machines). The pool was a bit of a disappointment with it\u2019s size (approximately 20 ft x 14 ft) though I must say the water left our skin feeling unusually clean and smooth (I can not say that a public pool has ever done that before!). There is fitness room adjacent to the pool. The late checkout (12 noon) is wonderful as well. A few items worth mentioning: the hotel does not allow pets and is with a short drive to the Bangor Mall.

Then entering the lobby I was immediately pleased, the colors of red and black gave the entrance a modern look. There was even a Starbucks and sandwich counter. My boyfriend and I entered the elevator and rode to the third floor. The elevator smelled bad and the rug was very worn.

I presented the authorization form and was asked for a piece of photo id (which the form states is required). I was given my room cards and on my way. Very quick and with a smile. 2) Highway noise. One reviewer figures that if one has a room on the front side of the hotel the highway noise would be nearly unbearable.
