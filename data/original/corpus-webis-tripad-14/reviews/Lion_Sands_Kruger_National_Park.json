The staff were intuitive to your every desire and our 4 night stay was one of the most luxurious we have ever experienced! Our game ranger and tracker were incredibly knowledgable and with them we had some great sightings of lion, leopard and buffalo. I was travelling with my husband and his South African family who have been to going to Kruger for 30 to 40 years and these sightings were some of the best they had ever seen. With that said, I must comment on our disappointment in Tinga's policy not to drive on the private roads of the concession after there has been rain. Unfortunately we had rain during part of our stay and therefore were not allowed on these private roads for 50% of our game drives, and instead had to stick to the main roads that everyone in Kruger travels. I think part of what you pay a \"very\" high price for is to be able to go where the general public cannot. The reason we were told that we could not go on the concession roads is that they could be damaged when driving on them within 24 hours of rain and may need to be repaired. Again, for the price you pay there should be some way to effectively repair any damage that may occur. I would understand if you were not allowed to go \"off-road\", that is entirely different from the graded dirt roads of the concession. Bottom line is that we had our best sightings on the concession roads, but on the public roads our sightings were minimal.", "title": "Fabulous stay but would have liked more game drives on the concession", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "WHERESWAUGH", "date": "October 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10112156, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Privacy of the lodges and the feeling you were out in the bush with nature", "disliked": "\u2014 Not all games drives were on concession roads - see review for details"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "An excellent location and first rate accommodation and guides.

It\u2019s one of the most luxurious lodges my partner and I have visited and in a quite stunning location, within the Kruger Park. Tinga has two lodges, Legends and Narina, both accommodating 18 guests each, I believe. We stayed at Narina in an extremely luxurious suite, with private deck and heated plunge pool overlooking the Sabie River. The room facilities were second to none and everything 5 star was available in the main lodge, including the meals and superb South African wines. Why not ask Tinga to send you a brochure \u2013 it\u2019s mind blowing quality, even better than their superb website!

The Ranger and Tracker were excellent, very friendly, informative and brilliant at spotting anything from the elusive Black Rhino to a small Scorpion on a tree at night. We have been on many game drives but we still learned something new from these two guys. If previous sightings or tracks were found they were relentless in their effort to find the animals in the bush, in particular the big cats and did on a number of occasions track on foot, close to lions so that we could then drive closer to photograph. We had some fantastic sightings of Lion, Buffalo, Elephant, Zebra, Giraffe, Warthog, Hyena and very, very close encounters with Hippo. We also followed a male Leopard in the early evening for several hundred metres, close up and that was very special.", "title": "very good but one complaint", "user": "JESSEIRELAND", "date": "April 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7483689, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Insects"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006, traveled on business", "text": "We played golf at the nearby Skukusa Golf Club which was a fantastic experience as it is unfenced to the Kruger Park.
