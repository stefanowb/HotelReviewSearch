My partner Linda and I arrived home yesterday,20th, after spending a week at the Belsana, Linda is wheat and gluten intolerant so the food on offer was not too good for her, but she muddled through in salads and fish. Yes the drinks are served in plastic cups but one dropped glass would be dangerous on the terrace/pool area. We went to Porto for a restful week and that is just what we got, a leisurely 10 minute walk to the beach every day and no reps trying to sell you a trip every other day. All in all a great holiday, with relaxation aplenty.
