Instead of the impersonal scripts of the major chains you meet a real Berliner (I'm not talking sugar-topped doughnuts here); whatever your interests, suggestions are lightly made as to things you might enjoy doing. For instance, Christian suggested we could easily travel as far as Potsdam to see Frederick the Great's palaces, and to the beautiful Peacock Island near Wannsee; these turned out to be some our most enjoyable excursions. There is only so much history one can take when travelling (no matter how many museums one planned to visit). With the guidance of a relaxed and friendly host, there are many low -cost yet intriguing and pleasant options you would not know about even from the top 'official' guidebooks. The plumbing may be a little eccentric - well, a few odd noises and poor drainage in a shower - but perfectly OK. Wi-fi good to keep in touch with home. Only lack - a kettle in the room to make a cup of tea at night. I would stay here again if I get the chance.
