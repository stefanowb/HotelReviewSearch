Clean room which is an absolute must. Just a few minor complaints; I travel with my own shampoo and bath gels but I do expect hand soap to wash hands after visiting the bathroom, there was none until my husband relocated the dish washing detergent to the bathroom and we purchased soap for the following day. A pancake with a side bowl stuffed with gray steaming brown n serve sausage hot out of the microwave does not a breakfast make. The alternative I selected was from a bowl of yogurt with what I thought was fresh fruit until I bit down on a frozen blueberry right out of the freezer. Not sure where the wonderful breakfast was but we didn't see it. Skipped out early and headed straight to Ihop for some protein to prepare for a very physically active day the following morning. The \"no locked doors\" was something we found a bit odd but others may not. We are long time Alaska residents and understand the concept of \"we're safe out here in the woods\" in \"theory\" but I would like to be comfortable leaving a laptop or other personal items in a room. Not a fan of two unlocked doors to gain entry to the room I am renting (one via an outside entrance), this may just be our own personal idiosyncrasy. We are accustomed to removing shoes upon entry to a home here in Alaska as we do this in our own home but I thought it odd that we were greeted by the enormous, furry, husky family dog as we came upstairs to approach the breakfast table (barefooted to be respectful of the no shoes rule). Didn't really mind the dog being there but I would have worn my shoes to breakfast had I known and think it should be mentioned (if it was I didn't see it) in the advertisement that there is a family dog that might make some people feel uncomfortable. Did the dog remove his/her shoes ? All in all it was a comfortable bed, clean and served our purpose for the two nights we spent there.
