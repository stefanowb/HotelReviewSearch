Our dinner took an exceptionally long time- our total dining time was 1 and a half hours. My husband's beef was well done, when he asked for medium rare, and the morel mushroom topping described on the menu was absent. Also, the serving size was exceptionally small- his meat was probably less than 5 ounces. The price for this entree was $30. I had the pecan pork tenderloin for $28 which included about 6 ounces of meat (the meat tasted good) accompanied by an undercooked potato and a few asparagus stalks. The waitstaff was very sweet, though, and we thought all of this was a fluke. We dined again on Saturday night, and my husband ordered the beef entree again,(medium rare) reminding them to not forget the morels. I ordered an indian chicken dish. The beef entree came well done + , and was topped with ordinary mushrooms. My chicken dish was awful. It was approximately 2 ounces of grilled chicken on a bed of al dente mixed peppers with curry sauce over the peppers. I told the waitress that this was the strangest indian dish I had ever tried, and I asked for some rice to go with it. She gave me a plate of rice pilaf. I ate the chicken, but left the rest. I also pointed out that on the menu, the indian dish is advertised to come with tomatoes and onions, she shrugged and explained that they had a new chef. The cost of this chicken dish was $21. None of our entrees were presented like the entrees pictured on the website.

Our server was bright and bubbly and let us take our time through all the courses of a wonderful dining experience in the very crowded dining room.
