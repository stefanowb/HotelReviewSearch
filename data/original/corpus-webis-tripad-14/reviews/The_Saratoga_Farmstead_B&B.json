It was a step back in time with all the comforts you would want on a vacation. The only thing missing was a TV (my partner and I are TV addicts!), but we had such a good time we didn't miss it. The comfortable parlor room was stocked with snacks, soft drinks and local wines and beers - what a treat! Best of all, you wake up to a fabulous farm to table breakfast prepared by two chefs.
