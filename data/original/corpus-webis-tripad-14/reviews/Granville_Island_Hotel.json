Service seemed fine enough then, although we had no reason to really deal with them. The second time I stayed there was a marked contrast -- so much so that I'm not sure I want to stay there again. We requested a king, but were booked into a room with two double beds, overlooking a boardwalk so we couldn't open our curtains. When we saw a couple check out, we asked if we could be switched to their room instead (we were just there for one night) and were told the same \"sorry, we are fully booked.\" I don't quibble with hotel management since I'm sure they have reasons for doing things the way they do, but I don't like being lied to. Some kind of simple explanation would have satisfied us instead of a template response. When we were leaving to go the airport, we asked for a cab, to be met with the response, \"oh, there are always cabs outside.\" After waiting 10 minutes outside to no avail, we decided to hoof it to the nearby cab stand. Amazing that the hotel staff couldn't even be bothered to call for a cab on a quiet early Saturday morning. When we stored our bags in the hotel's baggage area, one of the bags' handles was damaged when it was returned to us. After the annoyance of being treated rather shabbily we decided to forego complaining, cut our losses and learn from this experience. What a shame.
