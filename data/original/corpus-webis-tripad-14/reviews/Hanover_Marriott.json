For starters, it's absolutely lovely to look at. All new, recent renovation, and spotlessly clean. Very high marks for whomever was in charge of the decor. The lobby is done in a very spacious and airy sort of Scandinavian style. Beautiful glass fixture----really too large to be a chandelier, it's more of an art installation which happens to have lights---on the ceiling as you walk in, and a smaller version near the check-in desk. tasteful, unadorned furniture, pretty and unusual paintings and sculptures throughout, big atrium, lots of natural light. The rooms are done in a vaguely Asian style with lots of attention to detail. Nothing here looks like standard-hotel-issue (raise your hand if you're sick of burgundy paisley), it looks like someone's house. Someone with good taste.Color scheme is pear green and dark walnut brown with a few touches of aubergine. (did I mention I was sick of burgundy colored patterns in hotel rooms? It makes me wonder what it's trying to camouflage!)The lamps, the mirror frames, the light fixtures, the wall art AND the frames they're in, even the taps and faucets are all very tasteful and pleasing to the eye. Beds and bedding very comfortable and brand-spankin'-new, and you get a whole pile of pillows to nest in. I found my room to be very clean, very quiet late at night, and when you turn on the heat, it makes only gentle white noise, not the jet-engine sounds you get at some hotels! We had several occasions to consult the front desk staff: how to get to nearest train station, where is there good shopping, etc and they were always friendly and helpful. We had drinks in the bar twice, very pleasant and cozy Irish style pub with lots of heavy wood and subtle low lighting. It's called Ye Olde Shebeen.(I had to look that up---shebeen is an unlicensed drinking establishment. I'm sure they're kidding.) and my travelling companion dubbed their bartender \"best Cosmo maker ever\". We had breakfast in the restaurant once, got the buffet for $16, everything fresh and tasty. Would definitely recommend this place to all.
