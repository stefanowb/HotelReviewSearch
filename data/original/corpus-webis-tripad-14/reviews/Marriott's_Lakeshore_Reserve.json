I don\u2019t see why this request shouldn\u2019t have been fulfilled with this much notice. We had a room in the front of the building right next to the front door and elevator. To top it off, our little corner area where our room was at was the only area with tile floors outside the room, instead of carpeting. Let\u2019s just say we heard even the slightest noise. When we walked into the building, we were greeted by about 10 loud construction workers leaving. Not a big deal since they were leaving. Not so. Sitting in our living room, all we could hear was tile being chiseled in the room upstairs- something that should have been done earlier in the day before guests arrived. Also one of the previous guests thought it would be funny to go around and put the parental lock on all of the TVs in the suite. The front desk sent up an engineer who tried his hardest but could not ultimately figure it out. So we only got basic channels. My concern is I called the front desk and was told there was nowhere else they could move us, nothing they could do- even with all the noise and non-working amenities in our bottom floor room we asked not to get.
