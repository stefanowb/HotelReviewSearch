There's some sort of strange eatery on the corner that's open nearly 24x7 and thusly attracts a lot of strange people. There's no overnight parking in the area. The rooms were filthy, the plumbing is circa 1960s. My bedspread had cigarrette burns in it, my chair had a knife slash in it. The room smelled of fresh vomit when I arrived and it did not have AC. The bathroom towels had stains on them and the water coming out of the tap was brown. The doors have 4 locks on them and trust me you'll feel like you need them. I lost track of the number of drunks I saw, and at one point had to ride in the elevator with a woman who was obviously on drugs and had a stun gun that she kept clickin on and off at her side.

Though even if you don't, like we forgot, the room you'll get is clean as can be. Make sure you get a room with it's own full bathroom. It's an old hotel so there are some rooms that don't have a bathroom inside and then you have to share, which you DO NOT want to do. The hotel itself is well worth the price. Really the only thing we ran into as far as not impressed were the people that stay there. It's a variety, but you can tell that the local druggies do rent I'm sure by the week, they stick to themselves though and we didn't run into any problems.

Everything was OK by me, I always got my favorite room. Never had a problem until one night there is a banging on my door late at night. I answered and a security guard pushed his way into my room saying he had a noise complaint. Standing outside my door he could have heard if there was any noise or not, but instead he chose to knock and push his way in. He looked in my TV cabinet and then even looked in my clothes closet, then just non-chalantly said \"go back to sleep\" and left my room. I got dressed and went over to a police precinct a short walk away and complained. The police came back to the hotel with me, one spoke to me, the other to the guard. The next day I went out in the morning for a short time and came back to find a metal plug in my room lock. When I went down and questioned why, they told me I had to leave because I called the police when the security guy was only doing his job. Looking back now, I guess I over-reacted by going to the police, but I couldn't understand why this particular guard did this, because the guards knew me well from coming and going for a few years previous to that visit. I was always on \"hello\" basis with all of them because I was in and out often on my trips and sometimes they didn't even bother to check my ID any more when I went in and out.
