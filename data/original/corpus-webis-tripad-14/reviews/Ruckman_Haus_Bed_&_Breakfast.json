We stayed in the Luxembourg Room for 3 nights. Even though it is their smallest room it was beautiful and quaint. The bed was so comfortable we did not want to get up in the morning. The entire house is decorated so nicely and Ron and Prudence make you feel right at home. We were served breakfast each morning and all I can say is bring your appetite. The food was delicious!!! If you are ever in the San Antonio area and are looking for a B&B this is it. We will definitely be staying here the next time we visit Texas.", "title": "Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!", "user": "traborn", "date": "November 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 49595596}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I were travelling with my sister and her husband so we actually had access to 2 rooms...the English Room and the French Room. Both were decorated beautifully and were comfortable and very clean. The bathrooms were not overly large but big enough. The shower in the English Room is AWESOME. The bed was heavenly with very luxurious linens. The house itself has been decorated to retain its hystorical background without being stuffy. Ron and Prudence are very welcoming hosts. They are both very helpful in steering you in whatever direction you might like to go and pretty much give you the run of the house. The breakfasts look great and taste better and access to soda, beer or wine is a really nice touch. The only drawback for us was the distance to the Riverwalk area. However, with Ron's help and directions we were able to navigate with relative ease.

They even served it at a time that accomodated us. They were so helpful and thought of everything! The best part was the price! They are so reasonably priced and even gave us a military discount!

It is located on a quiet street in the Historic district, about 2 mi from the Riverwalk. We chose the Sun Room mainly because it had a King Bed & a private sun deck. It, like all the rooms were lovley. Excellent bed & amenities. There are 4 rooms on the second floor & one on the third. Two of the second floor rooms have a large varandas & ours had a sun deck.

Your car is parked in a gated area. When asked for restaurant suggestions, their choices were wonderful and they always provided you with the best directions. We wanted an idea of what we could do the hour and a half before our flight left and they recommended the botannical gardens. What a perfect choice to end our vacation.

The room was spacious and well lit. It offers a private deck at roof height. Trees thick foliage and the roof itself offer privacy. The rooms furniture was very comfortable to cuddle up with a good book. There isn't a traditional closet in the room. However there is a space across from the bathroom sink with ample hanger space and small bench to store your suitcase. An antique chest of drawers houses the clothes you do not hang. The shower stall has 5 directional water spray heads and the water will be as hot as you can stand it. Prudence Ruckman knows the city well and will gladly assist you finding points of interest. The night was quiet because you are Not on the Riverwalk. It is a few minutes away. The common areas are comfortable and clean and interestingly decorated. I had no issues concerning security in the neighborhood when parking at the curb although you can park behind a security gate if you prefer. The breakfasts are included in the room rate and are wonderful. You will not go away hungry! Ron and Prudence would be happy to share a little bit of heaven on earth with you.
