We booked direct with the hotel. We were due to stay at the hotel next door but got this one $20 cheaper per night. Money well saved. Sure the place is more like a motel and a bit dated. The rooms were clean, the showers could get a little cold, parking was $4 a night and i would of liked to of checked in earlier after a 14 hour flight...BUT i came to see Disneyland. PERFECT location..BY FAR!!!!! I just wanted a place to sleep and my belongings were safe when i was at the park, but to be honest i think i got more. The rooms were pretty big. We had the kids (4 of them) in one room and us in the other. All six of us did not get in each others way. Sure the tv is a little old, but i didnt come to Disneyland to watch tv. The beds were ok and the pillows. We were so tired after the park we could of slept on the floors. The rooms were clean when we got back each night. VIP tours has an office and pick up from there. Hotel has a handy laundry and a ok gift shop for snacks and such. Always went out to the many places to eat along the way to Disney so never ate in the hotel. Would not use the rent a car in the hotel though. The guy running it kept me waitng nearly an hour while seeing other people that came in after me. Sretty much not to know what he was doing...the Alamo just down the round and around the block was PERFECT in every respect, also a better rate and so much better service. We would walk to the park each day (10 mins max at a slow rate) so no need to stay at a hotel with a shuttle. The front desk staff were neither here nor there. Not good or bad. Didnt do anything bad but also didnt blow me away with great service. They do have internet to use near front desk, but were expensive. Better off going down the road to some of the stores that have internet in them or you could use the net at the Cleaver Bros who also had it, though i didnt use it. Bought citypass through them and got 3 days at Disney,1 at Universal, 1 at SeaWorld and 1 at the San Diego Zoo. GREAT value. We hired a car and drove around with GPS. VERY easy. All in all would gladly stay here again. It was perfect for what we wanted and at a great price. $130 US a night for both rooms. Right across from California Adventure. How could you possibly ask for more. Rooms clean, large and felt safe. We had a fridge in both rooms and a microwave in one. Huge swimming pool and spa. If you want to go on holidays and spend lots of money to be pampered and stay in your room this is NOT the place for you. If you would like to save money to spend more time seeing the parks and sights this is perfect...

The second trip we utilized the 2 room-combo (two rooms with interconnecting door) for only $109 so we could bring Grandma along.
