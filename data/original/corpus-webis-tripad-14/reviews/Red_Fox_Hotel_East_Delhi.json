The facilities they have at the hotel is above my expectation and the condition of the hotel is just like the 5 star hotel. I am glad my stay was a pleasant and the credit goes to the Hotel staff especially under the management of Mr. Ajay. The buffet i had for the 3 months was very nice as tasty as everyday i got to try the variety of indian taste. The chef has done a wonderful job. The staff at the cafe are very nice and friendly and they are always ready to provide services. In overall i didn't expect i would feel like home away from home while i was in New Delhi. Thanks to all the staff and the management of the hotel for making my stay the most memorable.
