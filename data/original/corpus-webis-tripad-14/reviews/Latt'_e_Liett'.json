He is a traveler, too, and knows what matters to travelers. He had lots of information about Naples, including his favourite restaurants. He was very friendly and even left some delicious cake for us. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The location is very convenient, just a bus ride away from the central train station or the Circumvesuviana train station, and across from the port which is very convenient if you're looking to take the ferry to Capri. It was a short walk to Spaccanapoli and Galleria Umberto, plus lots of good restaurants nearby.", "title": "Very nice apartment; good location", "user": "LizardBang", "date": "September 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 45320138}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The only thing to improve, which I suggested to Giancarlo, was to provide healthier breakfast alternatives like muesli or oat meal.
