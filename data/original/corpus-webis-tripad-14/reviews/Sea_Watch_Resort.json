We have stayed here before with our children and had a great experience then..and an even greater experience this time! We have stayed at other resorts in Myrtle Beach, but there are some things that the Sea Watch offers that we haven't found anywhere else. First, there is the convenient parking. The parking garage was right under the building we stayed in. We always have had access to luggage carts and a minimal wait for the elevators. This is important especially when traveling with children. Also, we love the easy access to the beach. Some resorts don't have the easiest access in the world. The tiki bar is awesome! Again, we didn't have to go out of our way to find it. It was right on our way down to the beach. There was a DJ there on the Saturday since it was Labor Day week-end. The DJ was great. The pools are nice and clean however one of them was extremely cold! And have I mentioned the breakfast?? This is the main reason my husband wanted to come back here! The breakfast is out of this world!! The omelet station and waffle station are AWESOME! I had mine made with egg whites and the cooks made them however we wanted!! We had our breakfast oceanside every morning!! The breakfast was included with our room, and I can tell you that we don't know of any other resorts who offer this caliber of breakfast! The exercise room is great also. High quality commercial treadmills, bike and elipitical. GREAT! Housekeeping was great, too!!! You can't beat the little things that make this resort so spectacular. It does need updating, but one can certainly overlook that when you consider the price and all of the personal details that make this resort so special.
