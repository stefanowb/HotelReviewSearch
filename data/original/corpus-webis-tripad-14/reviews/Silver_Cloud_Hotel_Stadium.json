Arrived from Victoria, BC on saturday afternoon and to our surprise our room door had a \"Privacy please\" sign, that we did not leave there. I thought my room had beed given away to another guest. After trying to open our room door a few times and seeing that the key was not working, we decided to give it a little push, discovering that it had been opened by someone else and left open. The room had not been touched by housekeeking at all, for 2 days. It was just as we had left it. Nothing we could do at that time since we had made reservations for dinner and were kind of in a rush. We called the main desk, asked for soap and fresh towels, which were delivered soon. After dinner we returned to the hotel, it was around 10:15PM, tried to open the room, keys did not work this time. Went to the front desk, reprogammed them, tried again, nothing. After going back and forth to the front desk to reprogam the keys, three times, our door still remained unopened. 5 staff personnel, (as if I did not know how to do it), came and tried to open the room, for a total of eight tries now, finally realizing that the lock was somehow damaged. It is now past 11:00PM, we are still locked out of the room and the maintenance person is gone for the night. Front desk stated that the hotel was at its full capacity and they could not provide us with a courtesy room to spend the night, therefore; we had to wait for the maintenace guy to come back from his home, at that time of the night , and see what was wrong with the door lock. We went back to the front lobby to wait there, were given two small bottles of Minute Maid orange juice for consolation, and were told that maintenance had been contacted and that within 15 minutes the problem was going to be solved. At 12:30 AM, after 2 hours and 45 minutes locked out of our room, tired and sleepy, front desk finally told us that our door had been opened by maintenance and that the problem was that the lock since it is electric, had run out of batteries. WHAT!!!!???? Don't they perform preventive maintenance or their equipment???? Don't they change the door lock batteries periodically?? For the price they charge for their rooms, the lock ran out of batteries, that's it??????. How do they explain that someone opened that door, left it open, placed a \"privacy please\" sign on the door, but no one reported that the lock was having problems?

The walk to Pioneer Square is about 10 minutes but is a lonely walk if there is no sporting event. It didn't feel unsafe after dark, but not many folks were around. Breakfast is not included and parking is valet parking for $20/night. The very comfortable room had fridge/micro/coffee. Counters are granite and the TV is a 42\" LG flat screen. There is a couch, we had a king bed and the desk has easy access power for your laptop. The room safe holds one laptop. Wireless connection is free and quick. There is an hourly free shuttle to deliver you to restaurants etc. Good deal? Yep, a really good deal as long as you are not intimidated by the lonely neighbourhood after dark. Oh yeah, there are two Italian restaurants a block south of Fado Irish Pub. One is street level but the one with atmosphere is downstairs. Great atmosphere but the worst Italian food ever.

First time visiting and this hotel made it just the best experience. We loved the room, sooo clean and lovely to sleep in. The tv and movie service just topped off our evenings. The pool/hottub area are just awesome and overlook the pier area and the safeco field. It has a nice restaurant in the hotel as well right across the street. It is a little far to walk some days to the pike market or pioneer square but the shuttle offered could not of been any better. When we called for pickup it seemed like we waited no time at all and the drivers were fantastic with all sorts of suggestions. We used the shuttle extensively and it never let us down. Will definitely be staying here again.
