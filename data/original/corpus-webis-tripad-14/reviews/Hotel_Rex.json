I can understand why the other reports on this hotel are poor, as the 3 star rating is a bit surprising however if you just want a clean bed to put your head down in every night that isn't going to cost a fortune go for it. We only had 3 days in Florence so we didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room anyway Our room was at the front of the hotel overlooking the Irish bar it was a bit noisy so if you're a light sleeper request a room at the back of the hotel or bring earplugs.Breakfast was a typical continental breakfast just basic no thrills tea/coffee, cereals, croissants, rolls, preserves and tinned fruit.The main thing this hotel has going for it is the location, its central to all the main places of interest with just a 3 min walk from the Cathedral if that.On summary I would say go to this hotel just don't go with any great expectations.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 25, 2002", "id": 703821}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel was a great find.

The hoilet was also inside the shower part so we had to wipe everything down after using the shower so that the next person could use the toilet without getting all wet.

The hotel's biggest plus point is the location which is superb as you can literally fall out of bed slap bang bump right into the middle of the Historical Centre of Florence.

Our room was very small. We had three people, so we had the \"triple\" room with 3 smaller than avg twin size beds, but from judging from all our research before we booked this room, most of the hotels in rome looked like they had relatively small rooms. Also, the bathroom was huge, but the bathtub was tiny and high so if you are tall you would hit the mildew infested celing. The showerhead was detachable but not really usable as a real shower because if you hung it up on the stand, then it would shoot straight across the bathtub and get the bathroom floor all wet, you would still be dry in the bathtub. Overall the bathroom was clean besides the ceiling of course, and the sheets were always crisp and clean, which was good and the there was plenty of hot water. we did not use the ac since it was pretty cool when we went. The rooms are probably a little outdated, but if you just need a clean place to stay this place works. Its in an excellent location, near the main train station so you never have to go far to get a bus or train. Also, I read in another review of this hotel that you have to leave the keys with the front desk. YES, you \"have\" to leave the keys which is kind of weird, that is what we were told when we took them with us one day. and also, there is only one entrance to the hotel so they know everytime you go in and out, which is kinda weird. You can always use the safe in the room for valuables. Also, apparently Italy has several different types of plugs, so you have to have a shape changer which the front desk was out of. The breakfast was ok, they had the basic things. Overall the hotel was pretty good, def. not \"four star\" quality but clean with a good location.
