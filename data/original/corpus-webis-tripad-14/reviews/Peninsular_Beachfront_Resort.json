Technically you could see some water, but probably not the view we had hoped or paid for. The furniture was a little dated, but comfortable. However.. the glasses and plates were dirty (very) and one glass broken in the cupboard. The shower needed a good scrub and there was mould in large patches on the ceiling. Our window blind also broke - these things happen, and a serviceman turned up to fix up despite me asking not to send someone til the next day as we had a wedding party in our room getting ready. Anyway, the serviceman just missed the wedding party, but not me getting out of the shower. Lucky I heard him, but he didnt realise I was there. I thought he could have offered to come back at a later stage but didnt - and he was sitting on the coffee table whilst repairing the blind which I thought was a little inappropriate. Having said that, we found the place relaxing and quiet, and the location was absolutely fantastic. I would stay here again - but hope that I got a cleaner unit and a bit more of an ocean view", "title": "On the whole, a nice place to stay", "user": "Heyco", "date": "September 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 41009226}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed at these apartments for the weekend.

We chose the Peninsula due to its location to the family pool, beach, restaurants etc... E'mail correspondence was quick offering me good advise in regards to which apartment (sea views essential!) would suit our needs. Unfortunately when I went to book on-line all their 3 bedroom sea view apartments were booked out due to Aussie school holidays, we were offered non sea views or we could up-grade to the Penthouse. We decided to 'splash out' and take the upgrade and paid them the booking deposit the same day, receiving booking confirmation and receipt the next day. I phoned a week out from our arrival and was reassured that our booking was fine. Upon our arrival we were given a key to a Floor 14? apartment, I asked \"wouldn't the Penthouse apartment be on Floor 21?\" and we were told that \"the penthouse was closed for plumbing maintenance\". So my e'mails, phone calls, deposit paid in advance, booking confirmation etc all means NOTHING!!! They mentioned the reception staff member should not have taken our booking and ended up leaving their employment a week later due to slack work issues. We were offered a very outdated apartment with no views at all, but chose to leave feeling very disgruntled at the way our family trip started so badly. Fortunately the hotel Oceans down the road were very sympathetic to our plight and were very helpful to make amends. The Peninsular was quick to refund our deposit, but feel they totally misled me intentially. Oh and they neglected to tell me the pool would also be closed for maintenance...", "title": "Not what you booked?

The location was fantastic and the apartment was extremely spacious, well decked out and had a large balcony. We also arranged to spend part of our holiday in Coolum and after spending 7 days at the Peninsular we arrived in Coolum and absolutely hated it so could not wait to get back to the Peninsular. At the Peninsular we were not able to stay in then one apartment as there were no vacancy but we stayed in one three bedroom for two days and then transferred to another for the remaining 6 days. The apartments all differ and each one is decorated according to individual owners tastes but all were comfortable and spacious. One apartment even had a multitute of DVD's and games which kept the kids happy. The pool area was lovely and well kept and sometimes we were the only ones in there which was great. I could see the older ones swimming with their dad from the back of the apartment while the baby slept. All apartments we stayed in had sea views but the ones on the side had the bigger balconies and views. The higher, the better. We loved this place and it was just across the road from the beach and also very close to a lovely playground for the kids. We will definitely come back to Mooloolaba again and when that day comes, we will have no hesitation to stay at the Peninsular again.
