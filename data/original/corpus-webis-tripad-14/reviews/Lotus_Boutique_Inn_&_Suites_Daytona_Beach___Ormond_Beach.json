The room was luxurious and very modern. We only met one of the staff people who checked us in, but he was very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.

We are Orlando residents so this was a quick weekend getaway. Unfortunately, the weather was poor but this resort was fantastic! In a nutshell - I felt like I needed a passport to get there. We love Daytona, but this is not one of your typical Daytona / Race / Bike Week / Spring Break hotels. This place has class and is incredibly clean. Beer, wine, cheese free happy hour, 24 hour coffee machine and the rooms have a modern vibe. What you don't know from their website is that every room has a refridgerator, coffee maker and microwave. We stayed in room 205 and it had two beds, separated by the glass shower bathroom. The staff, a perfect fit for the resort. Everyone we encountered was pleasant and eager to help and answer any questions. As soon as we can predict hot, sunny weather, we will be returning.
