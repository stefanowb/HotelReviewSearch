If I can sum it up quickly we liked it so much that we extended our stay one night just to enjoy the comfortable room, the amazing swimming pool, the unbelievable breakfast buffet and of course the friendliest hotel staff I've ever met while traveling. I could seriously go on here about how excellent it was but I don't want to bore you. Staff was super super friendly and they catered to our babies needs without hesitation. The baby bed was initially a surprise because it was more like a playpen than a crib but it had a soft cushion bottom and baby sized feather duvet. For 9 months our baby has never ever slept as good as she did in this bed. What a relief for tired parents. In fact we (including the baby) loved the duvet and child sized pillow so much we purchased them fro the hotel. And for only 450 baht.
