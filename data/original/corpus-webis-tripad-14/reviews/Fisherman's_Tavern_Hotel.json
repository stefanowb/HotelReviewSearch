Also,at breakfast staff were fantastic fun and could not do enough to ensure we had everything and more that we needed to have a fantastic start to our day. We were all so hungover from all our celebrations the previous evening!!!! A walk on the beach after a hearty breakfast did the trick and gave us the energy to browse the incredible array of bijou shops and boutiques. We hadthe best laugh, though, at a fabulous shop called Topsy Turvy. It sells beautiful gifts and the funniest (and some of the rudest cards I have come across in a long time) The lady owner i a delight too and didnt mind my friend and I helplessly laughing at some of the cards, along with several other lovely customers) We must have been in there for 20 mins, just laughing-dont miss any of these places if you find yourself in BRoughty Ferry.
