The atmosphere is relaxed , serene and gives one an appreciation of what it's like to live in one of those homes you see in magazines. We had a brillant time at the thoughtful hands of the excellent hosts Jacques and Joel who made us feel very welcome.

My husband and I took my parents to Bruges for a two day trip on their three week trip to Europe and stayed two nights in the de Triptiek B & B. We had a fabulous time mainly because of the wonderful hosts of the De Triptiek. We have traveled all over Europe and have never had such a pleasant stay. The B & B is wonderfully decorated and just laden with luxuries to make you feel special. Chocolates from Stephan Dumon's are on the pillows and special bath products are simply one more reason to want a long soak in their elegantly redecorated bathrooms! Although it was quite chilly while we were there, every night we came into a welcome fire in the fireplace downstairs and soft classical music playing in the background. While waiting for my mother to finish getting ready for our dinners I had the opportunity to peruse the hosts' library collection, which covered just about every subject. The icing on the cake were the hosts themselves however. Our breakfasts were scrumptious and full of warm laughter as they beguiled us with charming stories about the local area. Since our trip was on Valentines day they made reservations at their favorite restaurant and we enjoyed the best seafood meal we have had in Europe, in the last five years. Enjoying Bruges was really just an added pleasantry to the whole experience. Needless to say we highly recommend this B & B and will be going back there again as soon as we can!!!", "title": "Fabulous B & B!!!!", "user": "pharlap31", "date": "March 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14319552, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The hosts and the beautiful decor.", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing..."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved De Triptiek", "text": "We are from Switzerland and recently stayed at this newly opened B&B and felt we just had to tell people about it. De Triptiek is a beautifully renovated (understated elegance) old house with a charming walled garden where we could just picture ourselves having our breakfast if it had been in summer. Our room overlooking the garden was spacious, light and airy with a large comfortable bed and crisp white bedding; breakfast was delicious and copious and we had a hard time not to overeat!

Jo\u00ebl has personally overseen the renovation work on this gorgeous typical step-gabled Brugge house and the result has been exceptional. There is a living room for guests to use that is to die for - with beautiful antique portraits, gorgeous antique furniture and a lovely crackling fire lit in the fireplace! Two of the three rooms have wonderful views of the gorgeous garden that is tended by Jo\u00ebl.
