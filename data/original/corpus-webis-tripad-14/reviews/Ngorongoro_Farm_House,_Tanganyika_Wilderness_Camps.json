Not a big fan of buffet meals, but they were well laid out, good food, hot was hot, and cold was cold. Prices for drinks from the bar was reasonable considering where you are. Wait staff was very friendly. Sadly, in May it's cold and damp. We could not get things to dry in the shower as we usually do, but a little sun on the terrace fixed that. It was cool and damp at night and we could not figure out why until we realized that some of the windows behind curtains do not actually close, so the night air was coming in all the time. In the hotter weather, this would probably be a good thing. Yes, there is a fireplace in the room, but you have to pay for the wood service, and we're kind of stingy.
