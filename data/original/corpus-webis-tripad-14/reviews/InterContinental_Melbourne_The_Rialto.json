The Southern Cross train station is within a few blocks as is the river walk and its restaurants and casino. The building is a pleasure. It is two 1891 Venetian styled buildings joined by a glass roof over what is now the hotel restaurant but originally an alleyway. Valet parking is available. My room was fairly small, but with all amenities. Iron and board, robe/slippers, hair dryer, wall safe big enough for most laptops and equipped with AC power inside the safe to charge while storing, 32\u201dLCD TV, 3 phones, kettle and tea/coffee, wired and wireless internet ($29 for 24 hours, $10 for one), scale, Bose i-pod stand, newspaper, rain shower but no tub and a balcony overlooking the dining area. What I did not like was a credit card surcharge of 1.5% and the internet charges. I did like the blending of 19 century architecture with modern d\u00e9cor, the comfortable duvet covered bed and the trendy room furnishings. Since the 5 star Rialto has a gym, pool and business centre combined with all above it might be the best stay in all of Melbourne.", "title": "Euro style deluxe", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AlegreVancouverBC", "date": "April 5, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 60474571}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Hotel Intercontinental - The Rialto certainly impresses when you first enter with the massive glass atrium between the 2 historic buildings containing the rooms, however entering the room you are in an ultra modern room with everything you would expect from its 5 star rating. The room was well appointed, with a large plasma TV, desk which is excellent for business and comfortable bed. The bathroom, although large enough for one, lacked a bath tub, and the massive shower leaked a large quantity of water out onto the rest of the bathroom floor which did not drain away - poor design. As impressive as the view from the room out over the atrium was, the room did suffer from a lack of natural light. As can often be the case, extras not included in the room rate such as the internet access and breakfasts were rather over-priced, but overall a hotel which would be equally welcome by business travellers or couples after some indulgence.
