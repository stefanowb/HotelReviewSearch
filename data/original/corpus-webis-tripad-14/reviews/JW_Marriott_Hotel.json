Quite frankly the both rooms I experienced are a bit of a disappointment, they are small and the windows are tiny! Why anyone would design a hotel in such a magnificent location and then skimp on window size is simply beyond me. The Othon Palace for example has wonderful balconies and floor to ceiling sliding doors. I was expecting much more of JW Marriott. The Atrium rooms are dark. Two thirds of the rooms are Atrium rooms.

I perfectly understand how hotels work and was not slighted the least by this. So I waited up top at the rooftop pool where I was told I could order lunch from the bar. The \"bar\" is literally a tiny table-sized area w/ a few drinks basking in the hot sun with no one attending to the bar. I went back downstairs and asked for someone to come up to take my order or if I could just order there. They told me someone would be up any minute.
