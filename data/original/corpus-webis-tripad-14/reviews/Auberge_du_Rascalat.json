The location is very convenient for those travelling through France on the A75. It is in the bottom of the Gorges du Tarn, close to Millau and near the Viaduc de Millau. The rooms were quite nice, although parts of the hotel look in need of some tlc. Our room looked onto the balconies of the rooms below and these were in a very sorry state and the gardens have gone to see rather. The food very good and what I would expect in France. It appeared from the website that the hotel was next to a river but it was more of a stream really. There is nowhere obvious to walk to although we did not attempt to explore very much.

It is about ten minutes from the A75 autoroute to its west and borders the Parc National des Cevennes to the east. It was originally a mill for pressing oil and it seems to suit its surroundings. We received a friendly welcome and were shown to our room in the traditional manner - very personable. The room was what one should expect of a logis: clean and functional with a time honoured ambience. There is a small swimming pool for cooling off in the summer heat. The hotel was reasonably priced. The restaurant elevated the stay to an experience; the food was everything you would expect from a good, honest, regional French menu set in a light airy dining room with a large fireplace, in summer, you can dine outside. Breakfast was bread and pastries served with the best caf\u00e9 au lait I\u2019ve had in years.", "title": "Reassuringly Traditional", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "stuart462", "date": "June 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 33133142}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Midi-Pyrenees", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 6, "very good": 15, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
