Both the Resident Manager and the Duty Manager took personal interest in making me feel at home. There are several restaurants that cater to your taste buds and the ambiance just adds to your your feeling of comfort.

This is reflected in the style of the buildings and interior. It is not the most modern, but is in no way below standard - I disagree with some other reviews that suggest it needs refreshing.

The children wanted to enjoy the swimming pool; unfortunately they didn\u2019t carry the swim suits and were turned down from the pool. My special thanks to Ms Dinpuii who made it possible by arranging swim suits and ensured the children had good time at the pool. Thanks Ms Dinpuii for the wonderful time you had given to my children. I have to equally thank Ms Richa Gupta & Mr Swamy for arranging Spa at short notice and to Miss Priyanka for taking care of even the small things to make our stay very comfortable. My special thanks to Miss Aarthi Iyer for guiding us to choose the right restaurant in the hotel to suit us and giving us a good dining experience.

Though I have stayed here on many occasions earlier but a continued positive experience is compelling me to share my thoughts with other frequent travelers. As they say \u2013 \u201cBetter late than never\u201d. Apart from the convenience of access from both international and domestic airports and from business perspective, what keeps me bringing back to this hotel is the warmth, hospitality, friendliness, positive approach and professionalism of the staff. From the reception at the airport to the check-in to stay to check-out, the procedures are so seamless and there is always someone from the guest relations who reaches out to you with a genuine smile and concern to know as to how the stay is and what they can do to make it more comfortable. You get a feeling of being a \u201cwanted guest\u201d and not just \u201ca guest\u201d. I do not know whether it is appropriate or not but I cannot resist myself in extending my special compliments to one of the guest relations executive Ms Aarthi who is a very pleasant personality and made me feel like a wanted guest taking care of even the smallest issue. I also observed her interacting with several guests at the same time so that none felt neglected and I have no hesitation is crowning her as the \u201cface of ITC Maratha\u201d. The other staff as well be it at the concierge or the atrium coffee shop or the Durbaan at the entrance, are all warm and genteel. As for the food, I have tried all their restaurants which offer you different cuisines to suit your taste and liking and the staff and chefs make sure that you don\u2019t miss home food. The rooms are very well furnished and cater for all the needs. I must also compliment the senior management and the senior leadership of the hotel for training their staff so professionally and setting such higher standards of excellence.

The interiors are muted and subtle, with elements of both Victorian as well as Maharashtrian inspiration. It is in close proximity to the bustling business districts of north and central Mumbai, the NSE Exhibition Centre, and is a short distance from Film City, the Bombay Museum, and Borivili National Park. In addition, The Maratha is only a stone throw from the airport (2 km from the international terminal and 5 km from the domestic terminal) making it convenient for the transit traveller."}
