Location is just seconds around the corner from Victoria station and a lot of the theatres (we saw Wicked). Plenty of restaurants near-by for pre-theatre meal. Taxi rank also a stone's throw away. Also very central to take the tube anywhere. Beware if booking a \"family room\". They give you a standard room and attempt to put a single bed in the room aw well. This would mean absolutely no room to walk around either beds. To the hotel's credit, when I complained, they changed our room to the disabled room which was much bigger with a much larger bathroom but has a walk-in shower (like a wet room). It was perfect for us and appreciated the hotel's attitude to help make us more comfortable. I had read reviews about the noise - we were on the second floor right by the lift and didn't hear a thing either from outside of other guests. We also took advantage of pre-paying for our breakfast the next morning (it wasn't included in my room rate) @ \u00a313 for me and the girls were free.

When I stayed there was no fitness center but they were giving out access to the nearby LA Fitness which has a pool and is in just about every respect better than hotel gyms.
