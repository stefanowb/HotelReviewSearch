The room was clean and of good size. Bed was comfortable. Staff was very helpful. F Street Cars just a short 2 blocks away. Bus #30 line was right behind hotel.

The location was fantastic for it is close not only to Fisherman's Wharf, it was also close to a trolley station and cable car station where you have access to much of the city (check your map -- the trolley and the cable car takes you to two different parts of the city). There are also two car rental places pretty much on the premise (next door to the hotel). We rented at the Avis (the pother one is Hertz) and not only was the price reasonable ($34.00 a day), we were able to return it to the parking lot without any cost (parking can be up to $36.00 a day). There are also various tour companies nearby that can take you anywhere you want -- the concierge at the desk is helpful for these things, Although the hotel Bistro only serves breakfast (it's not bad, but it could be better),there are many places to eat within the hotel area. Breakfast was probably the best at the Denny's a block away located in the Holiday Inn. But as far as restaurants, there are plenty more nearby and it's also two blocks away from Ghirardelli where you can get chocolates and ice cream (as well as food).There are many shops nearby, including a Walgreens just a block away for basic needs (you can also buy souvineers there for a much cheaper price -- this advise was given by a front desk staff).", "title": "Great Location!

But after staying at the other Courtyard across town many times, I thought I'd give it a chance. Overall, the service was great and attentive, the lobby has free coffee in the morning, and we used the market a lot for healthy snacks and toiletries (which were all between $1-$3 - they didn't price up anything! Corona was only $3 too!). We were on the 3rd floor facing the parking garage. It was a bummer, but we're adults and knew we couldn't have everything we wanted in our price. I would ask for a room facing Beech street if possible for the additional windows (they protrude out). Location was amazing and was perfect for our needs. The Bistro on the second floor served really good food and was conveinant right before we left for SFO. I wish we would have known that there was a bike rental in the back courtyard of the hotel that connects it to In N Out. That would be have been so much easier than what we did.

The staff at the Courtyard Marriott are the friendliest around! Everytime you enter or exit the building, they greet you with a smile:) They are eager to help you any way they can. We pre-paid 3 rooms (2 rooms with 2 queens and 1 w/king) and received a reasonable rate in doing so. They were very accommodating and kept the rooms close together and even gave us connecting rooms for the queen rooms. Check-in was fast and we were in our rooms within minutes. The rooms were spacious and clean with nice amenities, including a fridge to hold a few cans of cold beer and bottles of water. The beds are very comfortable and they supplied plenty of pillows which is something my husband and I like because we are pillow hogs. The hotel is also very quiet and we did not hear any noise from outside or the hallways. The hotel is centrally located to the wharf and if you exit out the back, you'll be on the main street that takes you to the eateries and down to Pier 39. But you don't need to go far to find a quick bit to eat. In the courtyard you'll find Hooters and In and Out Burger. Across the street is pizza and in the side alley Subway. Just up the street is a Joanie's which is a great place for breakfast with killer pancakes! My husband's favorite, a beer store right beside the hotel so he never had to go far to restock:) A great spot to try for dinner is out the back doors and up the street to the left a couple blocks to Cioppino's which is an outstanding place to eat. (Check out my restaurant review on Cioppino's for more details). There is parking available for $34/day with in/out privileges which really isn't bad compared to other cities we've stayed in. The only downside, there are no safes in the rooms, which would be nice to hold your valuables when you leave the room. However, if you ask them at they desk, they will put them in a safe downstairs for you if you like.
