The hotel is above Le Taverne pub which is handy during the day but can be very noisy until 2am especially if you are on the first floor. The location is great if you want to be in the middle of the action, shops, bars restaurants and close to the slopes, which are a 50 metre walk away via an escalator. Breakfast is included and consists of cereals, fruit, fresh croissants and French bread and is adequate. The rooms are small and very basic, none of them seem to have had any kind of work done since I first came here 12 years ago. That said they are clean and some have balconies with views over the main square. Room 22 would be my recommendation as it is on the top floor and has a little more space than the others. Overall it is a good value place to stay in Meribel and one of the few places that does short stays during the ski season.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Hungry T", "date": "February 2, 2013", "id": 151214333}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with family", "text": "This is a small, \"cheap & cheerful\" place to stay when skiing in the Three Valleys and based in Meribel.
