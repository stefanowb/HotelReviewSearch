The suite had an amazing view and amenities that made our stay extremely comfortable and enjoyable. We brought food with us for our long and arduous road trip. We had packed so much that we heartily filled our full size fridge. What a pleasant experience it was to forage off of these groceries during breaks from the ultimate beach. This was my first time in Ft. Myers and we spent most of our days on the beach soaking up sun and ocean. We brought our own lounge chairs for the beach use and rented an umbrella from the neighboring beach activities rental company. This company also provided chairs and umbrellas for 20 bucks. 10 just for the umbrella. This money is well spent and I didn't find it to be too much of a monetary hassle. We were spending 6 to 7 hours on the beach each day. The hotel staff kept the beach and surrounding grounds in impeccable shape. This applies to the hotel as well. Not one single corner or edge had a crack or any dirt. I would like to personally thank Herminia for her dedication to keeping our room in order. She was prompt, courteous, and so very thorough. The pool was a bit crowded with children, but what can you expect from spring break week. However this may be, it did not alter our plans to take a dip or two. We found poolside lounge chairs available when needed. The ocean took precedence for us, and you may find the same experience once you realize how refreshing and delightful it is. As for breakfast, it was perfect for us. A Danish, donut, breakfast sandwich, and fresh coffee delighted us every morning. I did not sample the waffles, but my wife had cereal, fruit and bagels. I would also like to thank the staff who coordinated this for keeping it fresh and in plentiful quantity. The hotel also is within nice walking distance of the pier and surrounding shops and restaurant. Overall I give this hotel and the accompanying experience a 9.8 out of 10.
