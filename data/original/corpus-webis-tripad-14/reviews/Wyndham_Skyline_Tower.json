It was fantastic, none of us felt like we didin't have enough space. Beds were comfortable (even the sofa bed) kitchen and balcony were great. Staff was remarkable, always friendly and giving us great advice on where to go. The elevators were not as bad as other reviewers posted, as long as you weren't waiting for one during check in or check out time. The hotel is very well located near resorts casino( which by the way is the only casino where we won any money) and we tried quite a few. Grab the Jitney and you can pretty much go anywhere without moving your car. Parking is 6$ a day. with Valet. so we didin't move it until we left. You want to avoid the side streets of AC and mainly stay on the boardwalk and you won't have any problems. The pool is quite nice and they have a small hot tub outside which is fun. Also an activity center if you have kids. We actually rented some of their board games which are free (for a rainy day). The kitchen really is well equipped, a coffee maker is also in the room but you only get enough coffee for one day. So you have to buy some for 1$ downstairs. Which is understandable. The only thing to really consider if you should stay here or not is that they do not clean your room for you everyday like a hotel, this is a timeshare place, so unless you want to be pampered or don't want to clean up after yourself, this might not be the place for you. But like I said, we were 3 couples and no problems with even changing our own sheets. With that in mind, enjoy your stay. and don't waste your money anywhere but resorts casino. only place with 10$ tables. and the drinks don't taste watered down!", "title": "Enjoyed Our Stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "schoollady", "date": "May 9, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 15872971, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The service from the staff, the cleanliness of the suite.", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing negative to say"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled on business", "text": "My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Wyndham Skyline Tower.

Last year we stayed at the Fantasea, which is located right on the boardwalk, that was convenient, but the rooms weren't as nice. At the Wyndham, its a short walk to the boardwalk.
