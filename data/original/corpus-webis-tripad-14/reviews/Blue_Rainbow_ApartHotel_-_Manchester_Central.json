The Blue Rainbow Apartments fail in my experience to provide the most basic requirement of a place to stay in that they do not enable the customer to get a night\u2019s sleep. The place is incredibly noisy \u2013 and I mean LOUD! The apartments design is partly at fault, the large central atrium magnifies the sound of every single door opening and shutting throughout the night and the clumsy window and balcony door mechanisms mean the entire building seems to shake when they are opened and closed. By far the major problem with the Blue Rainbow however is the general clientele it attracts. The vast majority of the customers, who turn up clutching additional duvets and mattresses, return back in steady intervals throughout the night and early morning to continue their partying in their presumably overcrowded apartments.
