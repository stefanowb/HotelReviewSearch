Friendly, helpful staff too. BUT...it was so noisy (with the windows closed and curtains drawn) outside in the narrow street that we were woken several times every night. The revellers party on until the early hours, singing their way home and then the refuse/tradesmen seem to start VERY early in the morning...in other words, very little consideration shown by locals for those on holiday. We stayed at Blauvac for the first two nights of our holiday, hoping it would be less raucous the second night but it was no better, and consequently we were shattered for the rest of the week. The room was comfortable, if a little on the cramped side. The spiral staircase was a little precarious, as I had read, but the upstairs room was useful whilst we were both tossing and turning! Breakfast was fine, a typical French breakfast!

The hotel is located down a very narrow street and the screaming echos through the alley and makes it sound 10 times louder! If it had not started to rain at 3 a.m. I don't know when the noise would have stopped. If you want a hotel that is in an excellent location for visiting the Pope's Palace, shopping and not too far to walk from the train station then this is the perfect place and a decent price - nice bathrooms and our room was very spacious.
