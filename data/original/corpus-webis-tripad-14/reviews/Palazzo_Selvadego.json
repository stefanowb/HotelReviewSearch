It is the \"sister hotel\" of the Monacco Grand Canal, which is just a few minutes walk. We checked in at the MGC and then we were escorted to the Selvadego. Our room was very spacious and had a great bathroom and huge closet. It didn't have a fancy view, but that's okay because the inside of the room was great! We had breakfast at the Monacco Grand Canal and enjoyed the beautiful view. The staff is very helpful and they gave us great suggestions. One of the best things about Palazzo del Selvadego is the location! It is literally around the corner from St. Mark's Square. It's great to be within walking distance of everything.
