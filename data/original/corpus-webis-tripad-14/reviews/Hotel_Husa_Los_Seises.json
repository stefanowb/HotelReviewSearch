A card allow you to go in or out at any time, any way a person is still present and help you also for tourist maps and suggestions.

I also picked it for the trendy non-traditional style, the rooftop pool and terrace with a view, the interesting architecture and design, and the garden dining/bar area. Really everything I wanted at an affordable price.The room was large, the bathroom was huge, the bed firm (I prefer that, but some won't). There was a separate sitting area, safe, aircon, minibar. My only complaint was the paid wifi in the room. Almost every hotel has free wifi now. The lobby-area wifi was free but limited to 30 minutes. It seems every room had a different layout. Mine faced a big light shaft, but that was just fine. Some rooms had private terraces. As pointed out by others, there is some noise from inside the hotel, but it's not much of a problem unless you are very sensitive. Overall, this is a really good hotel worth staying at, but to be honest, it is getting a little shabby around the edges. It just needs a little TLC and sprucing up. By the way, try The Duplex tapas resto-bar on the corner by the hotel.

The other hotel was extremely basic and there was no swimming pool. We were told that we would be refunded for the night's stay but two months later there is no sign of this money. The other hotel was definitely not worth the same amount of money as I had paid for the Husa Los Seises. I would not stay here again for risk of the same thing happening.
