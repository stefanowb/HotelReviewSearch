The decor and personality of the room is standard- don't expect to be wow'ed with SF character or architecture- the room had none of this- just the basic necessities a hotel room would, a slight disappoint. The hotel is very close to Union Square, which can either be a good thing or a bad thing, depending what you are looking for. It is extremely close to a mission (south of the main entrance) where they feed homeless people and I made that mistake when Im suddenly in the midst of people holding drug paraphernalia out in the open- not a very good place for kids- was very dicey and sketchy. My biggest gripe was the per day parking- a whopping $52 a day. Completely outrageous. I felt like I had been swindled. I dont see myself ever staying at another Hilton after that 3 days of parking.
