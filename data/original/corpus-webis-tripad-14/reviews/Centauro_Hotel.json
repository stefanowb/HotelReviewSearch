Hotel itself was very old-school, old furnishings, shabby furniture. We could deal with this though since location was so good and we somehow got a good deal. No lift, but we didn't mind going up two flights of stairs with our minimal luggage. The breakfast was a highlight: fresh brewed coffee, croissants, deli meats and cheeses and rolls, yogurts, cereals, watery juices, and a hot quiche-quesadilla type item, which was good.

It was simply wonderful and a stay right out of a storybook! From reading the other reviews it is apparent to me that choosing the right room, and being willing to pay a bit more, makes all the difference at this hotel. Our room was located above a side canal and directly above the beautiful, flowered balcony off the breakfast room. The view was quintessential Venice and every evening we were serenaded by the singing gondoliers passing beneath our large, shuttered windows that opened fully allowing a spectacular view. The room was extremely large and decorated with old world charm and comfort. Queen size bed, full size sofa, amoire, desk/chair, sitting chair and small refrigerator...plus room to spare. The bath was adequate and clean and the shower larger than most European hotels offer. There was no tub, but not an issue for us. Yes, there was no elevator but being in Venice you must walk everywhere so toting large or many suitcases is not advisable anyway. A small inconvenience for the plusses of location and luxury. The hotel is a very easy walk from the Rialto bridge and an easy walk in the other direction from St. Mark Square. It is located slightly off the beaten track which makes it quiet while still being very convenient walking distance from most sights and/or the water taxi stops. The breakfast room at Centauro was a wonderful, welcoming experience. Offering cereals, juices, hard eggs, various cold cuts and cheeses, brewed coffee, tea, hot chocolate and assorted Danish and breads, it was a typical serve-yourself, European buffet but offered in a beautifully inviting room with floor to ceiling doors overlooking the canal below. We had beautiful weather in early May and the doors were wide open both mornings we visited and we enjoyed sitting right in front of the doors with a spectacular view of what Venice is known for! The hotel staff was extremely helpful offering maps when requested and holding our suitcases without charge on check-out day until our departure for the airport in the early evening. There is even a lovely sitting/reading area with available computer and restroom on the floor just above reception for relaxing either before or after check in/out. We did have rain one evening and arrived back at the hotel a bit wet and would have loved to be able to make coffee in the room, but alas no in-room coffee makers. A very small complaint and overall we really couldn't have been more pleased.
