The food was good and the staff was very friendly. We did experience a few problems however. First, when we arrived, the Decameron was overbooked and we were asked to stay downtown at the Qualton, which we did....... The Qualton is nice but not as well kept as the Decameron. There were forty of us in our group and we all spent Sunday and Monday morning there before being brought back to the Decameron. My word of advice is that \"IF\" they ask you to move, make sure it is worth your while to do so!!! They gave each couple $$$ to move --- and it was worth it even with our inconvienience to do so. The second problem was with our Apple representative at the Decameron, Manuel... He was less than efficient and caused us all problems in scheduling things we wanted to do. His assistant, Raul, pulled the rabbit out of the hat and saved the day for some that would have missed out otherwise. Most of us wondered why Raul was not in charge!!! The other thing that I wondered about is that there is no Creme de cocoa at the Decameron. I asked and was told they used to have it but do not any more. There are a whole lot of drinks that could be made using it and I wondered why but no one could tell me. Enough on the negative. We walked into Bucerias on a couple of occasions and bought a few things. It was interesting and we enjoyed it. We lucked out and got a room in Building A on Monday when we returned which was an ocean view and wonderful. We went to sleep every night to the surf. We did not make it to any of the shows but heard they were good. We ate at the buffet and the specialty restaurants and enjoyed them all. What surprised me was that we enjoyed the Thai restaurant the best. The food there was delicious. Everyone has their own ideas as to what is best though. The grounds were beautiful and they were working on things all the time. At first it seemed things were really far apart but once you got the layout down, it was easy to get everywhere.. The pools were great and the adult pool was everything they said it would be. No kid problems even though we are not bothered. Just another observation.. We went whalewatching on the Isis, a 65' (?) sailboat and snorkeled at the Marietta Islands where the people that snorkeled stated they thought it was some of the best they had done. The fish were beautiful and large. I didnt snorkel this trip but I did the last time we went and enjoyed it. (Our second trip) The whalewatch company has three sailboats and we had a wonderful day seeing a lot of whales and porpoises. The other sailboat is the Elias Mann, and I dont remember the name of the other one. They had breakfast treats for us, lunch, and beverages all included. Well worth the price!! Please excuse the \"disjointed\" content as I am typing as I think of things. Our friends did the canopy tour and loved it. They also did the truck trip in to the back country and enjoyed that too.(Vallarta Adventure??) We did that the last time we were in P.V. We tipped our room maid every day and were well taken care of. The beach is great. We enjoyed laying out and just enjoying the view. There were beach vendors who were great. If you did not want to see their wares you just said so and they were on their way. It seemed to me the main bargains were for silver and they did bargain. Just across the bridge going in to Bucerias was a lady selling hand woven rugs. I mention this because I thought they were exceptional. I think one of these rugs would last a lifetime. They were approx. $100. U.S. but I think they were probably worth it. We went back but no one was around so we did not get one. As usual, we know better than to leave and not get something important but we wanted to think about it... Sometimes if you snooze --- you lose..... This was our second trip to P.V. (our first was three years ago) and we probably will not go back in the near future. Only because there are so many other places to see. We enjoy viewing cultures of different people so we try not to return to the same place every year. Also, I think we enjoy the Caribbean side more than the Pacific. Again -Just a personal choice here. Any specific questions??

The grounds are beautiful with lots of trees and flowers. When we arrived we were greeted with a pineapple drink which made for a great impression. We stayed in block 5 for a few days, this is at the back of the resort by the adult pool. This is the newest and quietest part of the resort. We then moved to block 3 in the centre of the resort, close to the beach. This is the only block with a elevator. Block 2 and 4 are very nice also and are central. The rooms are pretty basic with no shampoo, kleenex,iron, and writing paper, but are very clean. We left a tip and perfume sample everyday and they made swans with the towels, and even made a rose out of the toilet paper. It made it exciting to enter the room because you never new what the would make next. The rooms have a safety deposit box ($$) with a key. The food was great, I tried to try different things. We tried the Italian and Mexican restaurant and both were good. The only thing about the Mexican restaurant is that you didn't get a lot on your plate, so if your still hungry you can go over to the buffet. The day activities were fun(always something going on). Every night they had different things going on from jazz bands to a nightly flea market. The theatre was very entertaining and always included the audience. You must try the hamburgers at the snack bar , they are awesome!!! There are 4 pools to chose from ,so your always able to find a lounge chair. The beach was nice and clean. If you feel like taking a walk there is a 20 minute walk to a small town called \"Bucerius\". They have a great flea market with alot of variety. If you need a bank machine there is one in bucerius by the chinese looking market on the main road before the bridge. If you need to exchange money there is a place across from the royal decameron that gives a great exchange rate.(better than hotel). There is also a pay phone across from resort. If you use it at night just ask the guard at the gate for a flashlight. Make sure you bring a Thermal cup for drinks as they serve their drinks in small plastic cups, and your forever running back and forth for drinks. Sunset is awesome , so don't miss it!!! If you get a chance go out and rent the watercraft and jump some waves.

There are four fabulous restaurants that served the needs of everyone, my groups favourite was the Japanese place, mostly because of the cute waiter who requested to serve us every night. The pools are ok but we spent most of our time at the activity pool and on the beach by the volleyball court where all of the action was. The on resort bars were open at 10 am and the latest bar was open until 1am. They were very convenient and served anything you asked for. I enjoyed about this resort, but the best part was the activities staff and the kayak boys. They were all good looking and they knew how to have a good time. I especially loved the pub-crawls with the staff, watching them play volleyball and playing volleyball with them. They were amazing!!! This resort is good for people of all ages too.

There are plenty of palapas on the beach but many are reserved by 8 AM. (contrary to the rules) We found the food to be excellent at all the buffets.

On our second last day at the resort, a note slipped under our room door offered us a stay at another hotel, many other guests had the same offer.

No one wanted to help. They send us to the next desk, and the next desk. Then you ask for a phone book so you can it yourself, well of course they don't exist. Gimme a break. Another situation. My sister and a group booked to go on a zip-line trip, so a lot of money involved. They were given wrong information and time. They were stuck at a gas station for 3 hours. The other thing that really bothered us was the scheming individuals everywhere!!! They start at the airport. The first person that we saw (airport staff) sent us to a desk which we thought was for shuttle directions. It ended up being another resort that wanted to scheme us. Give us deals on this and that, just come visit our resort and pay $20 each kinda thing. This took very long as we didn't clue in until the end that this wasn't for our resort and we MISSED OUR SHUTTLE that we paid $160 for!! We ended up having a hard time after getting transportation, and even then we were flying by the seat of our pants. The transportation that we did end up going with was scary as hell. Fast driving. Asking us if we wanted to stop here. Stop here. Stop here. Plus this was late at night. Finally we made it, but really scrared. Mexico is a scary freaking place. I will never go again because of that.
