Having heard some bad experiences about Priceline customers getting small rooms and such, we were a little worried. No need to be...I called Hyatt upon learning of my winning bid and requested a King non-smoking room. We arrived and were given just that and more. Our room was beside the Governor's suite and was quite large. A separate dressing area and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi greeted us as we opened the door. The location is terrific...just a half block from the Cable cars and two blocks from the Wharf. Safe neighborhood...we walked everywhere and had no problems. The staff was friendly and helpful and the bed was about the best we've ever slept on in a hotel. The room had recently been renovated and had a new LCD tv and new furnishings.
