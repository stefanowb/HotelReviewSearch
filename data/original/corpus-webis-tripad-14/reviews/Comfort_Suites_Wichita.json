Hotel is clean and very quiet. There were two double beds and a sofa bed, so it was perfect for travel with two teenagers. ( Two flat-screen TV's in the room, too) Front desk personnel were kind and professional. We arrived very late both nights, and check-in was quick. The only drawback was that breakfast is over at 9:00 on weekdays. This doesn't work for traveling with teenagers....at least my teenagers. And the room was just a tad pricey, especially considering today's economy. But other than that, I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying on the west side of Wichita.
