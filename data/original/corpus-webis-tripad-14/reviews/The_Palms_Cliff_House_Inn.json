I have stayed in many resorts and hotels, and this one really impressed me. I thought it would be nice, but I was very surprised by what we experinced, and it was all good. Our room was very nice, it had a bamboo canopy bed, my wife said \"oh\" and \"Ah\" quite a bit. I'm not that romantic a guy on a daily basis, but I scored points for this stay. I even booked us a his and hers massage. My wife loved it. I think if you are looking for a quiet and romantic place, then this is the place for you.

My Aunt felt I need sometime for myself and gave me a gift certificate for two nights. I took me a month to make the two days that I needed to use my certificate. It was well worth the wait. When I arrived, I was greeting by a local woman named Starr. When I was checking in, she gave me a Hawaii Savers Card for discounts on all the Hawaiian Islands. I told her that I read on the web site that they offered massages and I asked her is it was possible to arrange one for me. With no hessitation she called a therapist for the next morning and made the appointment for me. It was just what I needed. When she gave me a tour of the place, it gave me a feeling of peacefulness and the veiw of the ocean was simply beautiful. I got to my room and the first thing I saw was a very large jaccuzi set intoa bay window over looking the ocean.
