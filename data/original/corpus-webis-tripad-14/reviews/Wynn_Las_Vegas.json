From the pool, to the service, to the casino, to the restaurants... This is the best property in Vegas. I had never stayed on the property but had visited several times and knew I wanted to stay here. When I was booking the trip, I was torn between the Bellagio and the Wynn. Looking back, I have no desire to stay anywhere else. We visited the Bellagio during our time in Vegas and after staying in the Wynn, it looks old, dated and dirty. Im so happy with our decision to stay at the Wynn. My only complaints are: we requested a smoking room, got a non-smoking room and had to switch the next day which is not a fun event. Surprisingly, the smoking room was even nicer than the non. We stayed on the 50th floor with a great view. Second complaint: No where do they tell you that they will charge you $200.00 per night for a security deposit. For a person like me who does not carry ANY credit cards, I was upset. I asked if I could give them cash and get my deposit when I check out. They said no. I make a point to carry cash.

My concerns were the noise and the sun by the pool. I stayed in room 2217. 22nd floor overlooking the strip, not the golf course. Yes, I could hear the music at night, not extremely loud, but yes there was some noise, which was disappointing, because when I checked in I was told that this room was quiet, but I guess they aren't going to say its going to be loud. The view was amazing, I loved it. So the pool(s) - The sun did go behind the hotel around 2pm, but there was sun at the main pool until 4:30 or later, I should say, at some parts of the main pool, you would need to move to follow the sun. There was a separate pool for the Tower rooms, this pool started to get shade at 2pm, and was in complete shade shortly after. The Tower pool was for guests who stayed in the Tower rooms, my friends stayed in a Tower room and I was able to join them at the Tower pool. This pool was small. Tower pool was the only area where you could get an umbrella, if you got there early enough, and if not, you put your name on a list. The main pool had no umbrellas and little shade, until later in the day. Both pools became warmer as the day went on, because it was over 100 degrees outside. At the Tower pool you were given complimentary bottled water and fruit during the day. The Tower rooms were an upgrade for $35 a day, over the typical room. I had a typical room and it was awesome. I knew about the resort fee, and was ok with that. The Tower room, for $35 more a day, waived the resort fee. So you spend $35 instead of $25. I didn't upgrade. I was very happy with my room. The casino was quiet compared to other casinos, maybe they turn down the volume on the machines, or maybe people weren't winning? The Wynn is at the end of the strip, I am a huge fan of MGM, and the location.

The bed is so comfortable and was the best night's sleep I had on the whole of my two week trip in the US. Don't touch the mini bar or use the fridge though not unless you want to incur a hefty fee!!!! The hotel itself is amazing its clean, plush, fab shops and eateries, helpful courteous staff and it doesn't smell of smoke or weird air freshener unlike some of the other casinos/hotels I went to. The pool is huge, by the late afternnon one half of the pool is in shade but in the vegas heat this might not be a bad thing for some, besides which its quite easy to swim to the sunny half or walk there as the pool is not overly deep. There are plenty of sunbeds and plenty of opportunity to order a drink from the hostesses that walk the pool area. I ate at the Terrace point cafe for breakfast and again its perfect customer service all the way.
