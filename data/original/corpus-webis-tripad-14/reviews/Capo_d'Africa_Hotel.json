Try to stay away from eating at the resturants over looking the Colosseum as these charge top prices and the food is not always the best! also it is recommended that you get up early if you want to view the Colosseum you beat the crowds and have it to yourself before the coaches arrive. Although the hotel is away from the Spanish Steps, Trivi Fourtain areas, a taxi is not too expensive and walking will take approx 1/2 hour depending on how hot is it!. Another plus for staying in this hotel is that the area is a little Bohemian so resturants are cheaper, A whole Lobster around the Spanish Steps area will set you back Approx \u20ac65 the one I had near the hotel cost \u20ac35, and it was fresh. What to wear? well I was scared off by reports that in Rome people dressed up and this is true to a point around the posher areas, the Colosseum area, jeans and t-shirts were fine, so too were shorts, just wear what you feel comfortable in esp during the day. The hotel itself was great! the rooms although small were clean and there was little noise in the evening. It was lovely to sit on the roof terrace enjoying a drink or to (although a tip is to buy a bottle of wine at the small wine shop just down from the hotel on the corner and bring it back!) much cheaper! breakfast was good, you can see the Colosseum from the hotel only if you breakfast on the small terrace on the left of the hotel roof, unfortunately this is not open in the evening.
