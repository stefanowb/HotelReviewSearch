It's no secret that these flights can be grueling and a night at the Fairmont can really leave you rejuvinated from a long trip or provide a relaxing environment prior to your next adventure. I would normally never recommend an airport hotel for romance but I would highly suggest a weekend getaway here for those living in the Vancouver area. The hotel is just that good and to top it off, the Fairmont is directly inside the airport. Everything is of the highest standard and I was quite simply blown away by the hotel's attention to detail. To top things off, the bathtub in my room opened up towards the bedroom, which was definately a nice touch. I could go on and on about the threatd count of the sheets and wonderful service, but I will briefly say that everyone should book a night at the Fairmont Vancouver Airport because it will definately be one of those rare experiences where you feel a hotel has done everything right.

My next request could be classified as unusual. I asked the hotel staff to arrange dropping off the car to the airport rental place for me or, failing that, arrange for the rental place to come and pick it up. I had been driving for a few long days, it was late, I was in no mood to get behind the wheel again, and this was a 5-star hotel. It turns out this couldn't be done; it was if I was asking for a ride to outer space. Surely at an airport hotel, this wouldn't have been the first request for this, especially given this 15 minute parking restriction. An unusual request, but hotels of this class are supposed to deal with unusual requests.

The hotel is located directly in the terminal and is adjancent to the US Departures area making it very convenient for those with morning depatures to the states--the hotel is only a 5 minutes walk to the other international depatures and the walk is entirely within the terminal. Check-in was a breeze and we were give a Signature Room on the 9th floor. The room is huge and has an incredibly large bathroom with jetted tub, separate shower and all the other acoutrements of 5* hotel bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the desk was very comfortable. The TV was a bit small for a room this big but nothing too problematic. We had a view \"airside\" so we could watch the planes at the gates and some of the landings. The other side of the hotel has views of the runway and, given the number of international departures, I imagine a great spot for planespotting. The restaurant was very good both for dinner and breakfast and the few staff we came into contact with were great. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone arrviing late in the evening or with a morning depature as it is a true 5* airport hotel. One word of caution about YVR: If you are travelling back to the States, try and determine if any cruise ships have just returned. Three or four cruise ships had arrived early on the morning of our depature and the lines to check-in, clear immigaration/customs and security were very long as it took us about 2 1/2 hour to complete the entire process!", "title": "Superb start to a bad holiday", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "eldrakyn", "date": "June 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5335595}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "We stayed at the Fairmont Vancouver AIrport on the first day of our holiday, prior to picking up an RV on the second day..... less said about the RV/Van the better", "title": "Still a great choice for stopping over", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "JLInternational", "date": "May 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5065776}], "location": {"country": "Canada", "city": "Richmond"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 16, "very good": 185, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 666}, "aka": "Fairmont Vancouver Airport Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0416666666667, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "The Fairmont Vancouver Airport hotel is the only soundproofed, luxury hotel and spa conveniently located within Vancouver's International Airport (YVR).
