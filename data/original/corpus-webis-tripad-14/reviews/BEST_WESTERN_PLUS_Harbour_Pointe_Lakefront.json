We checked with local police and there was an empty hotel next door where we could park the van, that was fine, as I said it was only for a few hours. HOWEVER it was also listed as a non-smoking property and in order to enter the lobby I had to go through an awful cloud of smoke to get into the building. The folks waiting for the casino bus stood right outside the doors to the lobby and smoked away. It was disgusting. Then to add insult to injury, they allow tour busses to park right outside the doors to the rooms and they start up a little before 7 in the morning. It was loud and stayed there for well over 30 minutes, so much for getting a little sleep. When I questioned about that, the front desk clerks just shrugged, and said we get alot of busses.

There were two couples travelling to the Mackinac Island area for a weekend getaway and had no idea where to stay. We checked in Mackinaw City, but eventually decided on St. Ignace based on a suggestion from a friend that had been to the area. I looked around online and came across the Best Western Harbour Pointe. Based on their website it looked to be a very nice hotel. After reading a number of reviews on this website, I knew that did not always mean anything. I continued searching and kept coming back to them. I finally called the hotel to get some info on the area and the lady at the front desk was very helpful and answered all of my questions. I booked the rooms on the phone and was looking forward to the trip. When we arrived, the front desk staff was very helpful and gave us info on good places to eat, etc. We made our way down to the ONTARIO building which is the key to your stay. Make sure you ask for the ONTARIO building. The view from our King room was simply amazing. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and our private deck was great. We did use the outdoor whirlpool and (supposedly) heated pool both nights. We had the breakfast on the morning we checked out and it was good (doughnuts, bagels, cereal, toast, etc.). I have to say our entire stay was as good as expected and would not hesitate to go back to the Harbour Pointe!!!! Mackinac Island is also pretty cool too. We were able to ride our bikes(2 minute ride) from the hotel to catch the ferry downtown St. Ignace. As for food in the area we at at Driftwood (sports bar) and the Mackinac Grille.

Call us back if anything else comes up.\" Harbour Pointe was easy to locate and is just a couple of blocks from Shepler's Ferry, well within walking distance. Check-in was a breeze and Pam was 'spot on' with information. She gave us tour and ferry information for the Island and a few valuable insider tips for biking around its perimeter. Kathy was our housekeeper during our stay and we felt comfortable leaving our belongings in the room while we visited the surrounding area. Everything was kept immaculate and we felt safe. No complaints. The hotel provided a nightly bonfire on the beach. There were two pools; one indoor and one outdoor, but we were busy doing other things and didn't take time to enjoy them. The grounds were groomed continuously and management paid attention to detail; very clean and well maintained. I personnally applaud this hotel for being pro-active in regards to guest safety. The shower tub's base is coated to prevent falls, which I appreciate after suffering falls at two different hotel chains. Our room had a balcony facing the lake with a view of Mackinac Island. The seagulls and Canadian Geese would gather in the courtyard below as if to welcome visitors. Raleigh worked the desk and was available to assist with questions and always queried as to how our trip was going. Couldn't ask for a nicer staff.
