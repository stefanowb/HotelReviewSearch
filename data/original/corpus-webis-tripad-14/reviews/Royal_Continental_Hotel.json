We has a very spacious room opposite the fort/castle with beautiful views of the sea. Nearby there are lots of bars and resturants but we chose to eat in the hotel and we were really pleased with the food and the service, we would have said we would return to the hotel in the future until arriving home I found an expensive purse still in its box a present received on the holiday was missing. We had stayed in 3 hotels on the trip the RC being the last before flying home, I called and emailed all 3 hotels . The Royal Continental told me without hesitation I had not left it whilst all the other said whilst they had no record of housekeeping finding an item but they would check again. RC also ignored my follow up email. I then called again and had a long conversation with a young lady who did put me on hold and then confirmed the hotel did not have the purse. I was convinced that I had not opened the hand luggage which contained the purse during my stay so I asked if the hotel could they review the log of entries into the room using my stay and which key had been used, the debate became heated and i was told to email the director. I did and did not receive a reply again. When I mailed for the 3rd time and asked them to support my enquiry i finally received a mail back to say they had my purse. I had to organise the courier and I finally have it back it cost me \u00a330 and it remains a mystery to what happened you decide !", "title": "sour after taste", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Nicky B", "date": "July 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167554724}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good base to explore Naples.", "text": "My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights following 3 nights in Sorrento.

The furnishings were created by the interior designer par excellence Gio Ponti, a master of modern 20th-century Italian architecture. The hotel has been entirely renovated and restyled; contemporary tastes blend with its natural elegance and spontaneity and with the refined mix of colours and sinuous but symmetrical shapes to create an ambience which is the epitome of hospitality."}
