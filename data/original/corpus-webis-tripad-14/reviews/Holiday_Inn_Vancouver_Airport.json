The hotel itself was a standard 3-star hotel, and we actually had a couple of hiccups when we first checked in. First off, the first night they were out of king rooms, so my girlfriend and I had to stay in two beds. They fixed this the next day for us, though. Next, we had trouble originally requesting a fridge in the room, but we were able to get that sorted out as well. Parking wasn't free, but $5 was pretty reasonable. Only problem is there's not much near the hotel... there's a McDonald's in the parking lot, but anything else and you'd pretty much need a car. Unless it's not raining. Oh yeah, the biggest problem we had was with the Internet... they have free wifi, but it's pretty bad. It worked great at some points, and barely acceptable at other points.
