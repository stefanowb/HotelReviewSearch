The lobby looks nice. Our room was clean but shabby. Maid service was intermitent. The front desk missed an important wake up call and didn't even apologize. Phone calls and internet are super expensive and don't work well so you pay even more. In fact, the phone calls are charged at a rate higher than their notification. You are charged for breakfast, even if you didn't have it and you need to call and ask to have it removed from your bill. The air conditioning/heating don't work. You can open the window but the loud road noise will keep you awake at night. We had scaffolding outside our window. Made us feel unsecure.

I hope he doesn't think everyone is a moron, or perhaps I looked like one. Perhaps he could have asked me to just stare and the problem will go away ??
