Ask for a room that doesn't face the street--we didn't, but got lucky. The hotel's interior decoration is rather schizophrenic, the spare modernist lobby-lounge-bar area standing in sharp contrast to the heavily draped and brocaded guest rooms. I would have gladly traded our room's fancy trimmings for more floor, drawer, and closet space, though I could easily say the same about most city hotels I've stayed in--there's rarely enough drawer space. That said, our room was clean, very quiet, and well-maintained, the bathroom spacious and spotless. (I don't understand what Europeans have against shower curtains or full-width doors--it's so cold in the partially enclosed set-ups they seem to favor.) We didn't eat at the hotel at all, breakfast being extra and expensive. We grabbed coffee and pastry at a bar on the way to wherever we were going each day, and for dinner would particularly recommend Trattoria Gabriello, Via Condotta 54, just around the corner from the hotel--best bruschetta I ever ate. For fantastic gelato, don't miss Gelateria Vivoli, Isola delle Stinche 7, just a few blocks away near Santa Croce. The best part of our experience at the Bernini Palace actually took place after we got home. I realized I'd left behind a scarf that I'd bought in Venice and called, not really expecting anything. But the maid had in fact found and saved the scarf, so my cousin (who lives in Florence) stopped by and retrieved it.
