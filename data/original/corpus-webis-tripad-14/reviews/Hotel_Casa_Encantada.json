All of us throughly enjoyed our weekend and would return in a heartbeat. The facilities are clean, beautiful and quaint. The location is great, on a quiet side street less than a block from the main plaza. Each room/suite is unique and uniquely decorated. Their website has accurate pictures and descriptions of each one enabling you to pick your quarters. The owners live in town and are very much involved in the operation. We had a substantial and delicious breakfast every day with fresh fruit, juices, coffee, Mexican sweet breads (pan de dulce) and an egg casserole. The kitchen staff readily accomodated my allergy to mango by preparing me a seperate fruit plate every day. The resident manager was professional, courteous, helpful and attentive. When we left he even gave us recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants at our next stop. During our stay we were in several other hotels and inns in Patzcuaro and I honestly believe La Casa Encantada has them all beat.", "title": "Hidden jewel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "EB3", "date": "May 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5068083}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Absolutely Amazing!", "text": "What a FIND! We had planned on two nights and stayed three weeks. Moved about to different rooms and every one is totally different, beautifully appointed and unique. The staff are amazing and absolutely full of great advice and ideas. The setting is magic and we spent hours sitting in the courtyard, listening to the fountains, birds, enjoying the luscious flowers and plants and art work absolutely everywhere. A totally relaxing and rejuvenating hacienda, beautifully restored and lovingly appointed which calms the senses, invigorates the imagination and lifts the spirit. We were made to feel so very welcome by the staff; it was like coming to a special home. The breakfasts are the best I have ever had at a B&B. Not typical at all, with fresh fruits and juices, filling main courses of great variety, lovely fresh breads and all set on a brightly colored table with flowers. Then there is the free Internet, piano, fireplace, books, CDs to borrow. I could not find a single thing missing from this place and we can not wait to go back again. The town is wonderful to stroll around in and we did so every day. There are some wonderful side trips as well and also a terrific recreation center with tennis, squash, basketball, gym, etc., etc. Worth the walk up the hill. An amazing place to visit. I can't say enough.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "canyongal", "date": "April 6, 2006", "id": 4943518}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wanted to stay forever", "text": "La Casa Encantada is truly a dream. The owners clearly love their city and have made their place so inviting that it's difficult to leave. It's the kind of city and B&B that makes you start wondering how you can chuck your entire former life and just send a mass e-mail to all friends and employers telling them there's been a change of plans, that you won't be coming home. The icing on the cake for us is that they love dog!

This lovingly restored Colonial Mansion built in 1784 is just steps away from the historic Plaza Don Vasco de Quiroga, in the heart of Patzcuaro, Michoacan. Immerse yourself it the quiet tranquility. Imagine being in an elegant 18th century Mansion yet with all the comforts of home. Here you will find peaceful luxurious seclusion in the heart of the city."}
