The location was breathtaking, with great views of the coastline from the hotel parking lot, perched atop a mountain. My only regret is that our ambitious impatience (since the shuttle wasn't coming for another hour) led us to walk with out bags up to the hotel, which was a huge no-no. Definitely take the shuttle to/from the hotel when you have your bags with you. Otherwise, it's actually a nice hike down into town. The room was nice and comfortable (you have to leave a deposit to get the remote for the A/C) and breakfast was satisfying. Overall, a thumbs-up.", "user": "drp231", "date": "June 27, 2007", "id": 8016561}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful location, nice hotel", "text": "My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

It is quiet and tranquil and offers a nice change of pace from the tourist-dense and busy town. The downside to this of course is that you are essentially totally reliant on the shuttle service. This runs frequently enough, so it's not a big deal, but it does take a bite out of your independence. Of course you can walk the 800 metres uphill, but that takes a lot of energy and courage.", "user": "Smartymarmy", "date": "August 17, 2007", "id": 8442209}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Great Location, Disappointing Hotel", "text": "If you have a car, it's a good hotel, because it has parking - a rarity it seems in town.

The check in was easy and informative. The room was clean and bigger than others we stayed at in Europe. The shower was the usual small European style, but the bed was comfy and we slept great. Best part of the hotel was the view! Absolutely beautiful. It was also very peaceful and quiet up there. We had no issue with the shuttle bus. We got in line about 10-15 minutes early to make sure we got on the first load.", "user": "Mstew77", "date": "June 19, 2008", "id": 17061085}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Stunning views, wonderful service!", "text": "We had a lovely 4 night stay at the Suisee Bellevue. Monterosso was very busy and it was difficult to find accommodation online (you can find cheap places if you take the chance of arriving without booking anything). Thrilled that we found this hotel, though I wouldn't say it was cheap but you got what you paid for. The views are magnificent, there are lots of areas to relax in the sun in, the staff are helpful and the shuttle bus is very reliable. Found it easily from the station. It was nice to stay out of the hustle and bustle of the town. We had to leave early on our last morning and one of the staff was kind enough to bring us a cappuccino and croissant each while we were waiting for the bus. Great hotel!", "user": "Schona", "date": "May 29, 2008", "id": 16484794}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Pros and Cons", "text": "Once I had decided to make Monterosso my base for my 2 days in the Cinque Terre, after reading up on several options, I noticed that most places on offer had their good and bad points. Ultimately, it sounded like a choice between staying down in the town (pro: close to the action and not dependent on shuttle buses for movement; con: train disrupting sleep) or staying up the hillside at Hotel Suisse Bellevue (pros: quiet, peaceful, nice view; con: reliance on shuttle buses and loss of independence as a result). So it depends on what you're after. I went with the good points of staying up the slope and I think I made the right choice. I could've been issued with more accurate directions to the shuttle bus collection point upon arrival in the town and not having a tree directly out the front of my balcony thereby removing my view but aside from that it met with my expectations. You just have make sure you peg your expectations at appropriate levels. I doubt any of the \"little things\" would've been much better down in the town. So overall, I was pleased with my choice and satisfied enough with this hotel.", "user": "AndrewP_72", "date": "March 22, 2008", "id": 14454406}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "You can do better", "text": "Cinque Terre is great, this hotel is not.", "user": "agun21", "date": "October 21, 2007", "id": 10207691}], "location": {}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 31, "very good": 48, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 30}, "aka": "Suisse Hotel Monterosso Al Mare", "slim_ranking": 0.684210526316, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}}
