Awesome night. Get there early to check in for New Years as the line up after 3pm was really really long. We were able to check in at 12 with our room being ready. That was a good surprise as we were expecting just to leave our things. Unlike other previous comments, we found this hotel to be great! With a 'romance' package, much more reasonable than just regular room rate at 400.00, we paid 289.00 not including taxes. Package came with buffet breakfast, and valet parking included, with a late check out at 4pm. We were able to bring our puppy, as they were pet friendly. they also provide a dog bed, and treats, which I was not aware of. The outdoor pool really really nice. Great to swim outdoors in the winter, really gorgeous. I thought the staff was great, especially at check in. Guests looking pretty exasperated in lobby with their long wait, but to be expected on New Year's Eve. Paid 50.00 to guarantee view of city hall which was worth it. Able to go indoors and outdoors throughout the night. Beds really really comfortable, and all the usual necessities provided. Clean, quiet rooms, which was surprising for New Years. Heard revellers in the hallway upon their arrival, but nothing once every one was in their own rooms. Silence really. Definitely going there again next year!! Late check out of 4pm a bonus and I think that comes with every romance package booked. Re food choice: Oh, only only order the burgers at the BNB restaurant. We had burgers at lunch outside of Sheraton, so we did not order them for early dinner. Big mistake!

The hotel was wonderful during the blackout, offering chilled water and bags of ice at no cost and did checks on everyone at infrequent intervals. I am writing this review now only because I just recently discovered tripadvisor. I booked my room using Hotwire and spent $49 US a night Sun - Fri. All I can say is my wife and I thought this place was absolutely one of the best rooms we have ever had. Down comforters, pillow-top mattress, extra throw pillows, two sitting chairs. We were given a corner room on the 27th floor overlooking the CN Tower ... whew, what a view, and whew ... what a walk up the stairs during the blackout !!. If you go, check and see if you can get a corner room. You get an extra sliver of glass on the side of the building, just enough to create a slight \"panoramic\" view. This hotel is centrally located, Eaton Centre half a block, Theatre District about 5/6 blocks , Chinatowne 5/6 blocks, Waterfront /Skydome/ Air Canada Centre all 6/7 blocks, as is the Hockey Hall of Fame. Bus and Trolley run right in front of hotel. The one bus that I mention will take you right to the ferry dock for the Toronto Islands Beaches (work on not having any tan lines ;-). Same bus taken from just across the street from the ferry unloading exit will get you back ... how easy is that? What is there not to like about this place ?? Sure if you overpaid for the room, maybe you would find fault. I honestly would pay up to $150/night US and still not complain about this place. Oh , which reminds me ... I do have a slight unhappiness (not really a complaint) ... the pool does seem a bit small for such a large hotel, but it was never overburdened while we were there. But then again we liked the half in / half out of the building pool design and there is a pool bar AND jacuzzi !! Didn't try the restaurants in the hotel. (we like authentic Chinese, Pizza, etc. from the neighborhoods) Believe me, I'm not bragging here, I can easily afford this hotel at published prices ... Hotwire is why I can, but won't ...

Everything seemed very close by and we walked to the waterfront area and the Steam Whistle Brewery (right by the CN Tower) and i'd recommend both, if you get tthe chance.
