Unlike Prague, staying directly on the Krakow square was very romantic, exciting, and a lucky choice on our part. The hotel accommodations were excellent. The room and bathroom were clean and well appointed. The room size was on the larger size for Europe. Our windows on the second floor opened directly onto the square and we found ourselves keeping them open whenever we were in the room in order to hear the sounds of the square and the live jazz music during the evening wafting up to our room. Wentzl is a RS recommended property. The staff was helpful and attentive to our needs, especially with our request to arrange for a private car and driver ($150 flat fee for the six hour excursion) to take us to Auschwitz (a well-advised choice instead of joining a tour or using public transportation). We chose not to purchase the hotel breakfast because there so many morning coffee and breakfast options within a block of the square, so we can not comment on it.

Each of the 30 odd rooms are individually decorated, and fantastically decorated at that! If you go onto their website you will get a picture of every room in the hotel - this was a first for me, and I work in travel. You can request the room you want, everything from high ceiling baroque to high tech - they are fantastically decorated. The hotel is right on the main square so position wise it doesn't get any better. The staff were so pleasant and helpful and will assist with all tours - just remember that as it is outside agencies they confirm you will have to pay in cash separately for any excursions. We had an evening meal in the Wenzl restaurant (menus and prices are available on their website) and the food was fantastic! The setting was 'olde worlde', with views over the old town square (and it happened to be snowing!), the food was exquisite (definately in favour of the meat lover) and the service wonderful.
