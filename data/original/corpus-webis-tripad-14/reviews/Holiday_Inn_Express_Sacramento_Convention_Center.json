The complimentary breakfast was actually pretty good offering a variety of foods, fruits, yogurts, cereals, etc. They also have a reasonable fitness area with treadmill, etc. The one ding I would give this hotel is their lack of a secured area for checked bags. I arrived very early and they couldn't get me in a room right away (they tried) so they said I could leave my bags in a open area next to the front desk and no claim check was \"needed\".

My daughter and I drove up from Fresno to see humorist Garrison Keillor and his \"A Prairie Home Companion--Radio Romance\" tour show at the Sacramento Community Theater which is located directly behind the Convention Center. We stayed overnight on 7/11, arriving around 4:00 p.m. that afternoon. Check-in was quick and easy, and the front desk staffer was friendly with a ready smile. He even informed me that with this stay I had now reached the next level of membership with the Rewards program, which I was not aware of so it was nice of him to let me know. He also let me know that we were within walking distance of the Community Theater and if we needed recommendations for dinner he'd be more than happy to help. This is the kind of service I've always received at Holiday Inn Express. We went up to our room and about 45 minutes later the gentlemen at the front desk called and asked if everything with the room was to our satisfaction-- of course it was. We enjoyed the evening and the overnight stay, including the breakfast which offers enough choice for even the pickiest eater. My daughter and I are both coffee drinkers and the coffee the Express chain serves is really good! I might add the dining area was very attractive-- the best I've seen thus far at any of the Express's I've stayed (not that the others were bad, it's just that this one stood out). The only down side to the room with this stay-- and this is very minor but I think worth mentioning-- is that we could hear the occupants walking around in the room above us (we were on the third of four floors), and our full size beds were a little firmer than either one of us would've like to have had. In spite of that, I slept pretty well. One more thing I want to mention here-- when I went to shower in the morning, color me stupid but I couldn't turn on the water and thought the faucet was broken. I called the front desk and right away the maintenance person came up and assessed the situation. The problem: I wasn't pulling the handle out far enough to turn the water on. I had initially tried to do that but apparently I didn't pull on the handle hard enough. The technician said that he'd come back later and would lubricant the component to make it easier to pull the handle out, as it was somewhat tight. He couldn't have been more nice or professional about my \"brain fart\" lol. This was my first time at this Express and I don't know when I'll be back but again, this stay was what I come to expect at Holiday Inn Express.", "title": "Near downtown SAC, but on the borderline.", "user": "bjaysfan21", "date": "July 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 166421556}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "For those who have read my other entries i have gone through a divorce. these entries will be from a single mans eyes.

After arriving the gentle man at the counter was very helpful. He was able to answer all my questions and even able to get me a cab ride with minutes after asking. The room was perfect, it was updated and had everything I needed for that night. The location is awesome for those who are looking for a night out. It is only a few blocks away from there down town night life. Cab was 8 dollars with tip. The cafeteria was the first place I met with friends. Very nice restaurant and literally in the same structure was a club called park. This place was crawling with women. When walked to other dive bars and ended up at a lounge called The Mix. This place was very nice but over crowded with guys. They should do ratio control at the door. The lounge is well known and a place to return in the summer. Back to the hotel. The hotel offers free breakfast until 10 am and it was ok. Great for being free but I can not complain. They had a buffet of pancakes, bagels, eggs, etc. I definitely would return here.
