Check-in was an absolute breeze. I did not have to wait at all, and it was around noon on a Saturday ( a potentially rough time to check-in). Front desk staff offered a strip upgrade for 10 dollars more per night, and considering how low the rate was on my room I figured why not. My room was much better then I expected. It was very large and had a nice bathroom with an interesting view out to the parking lot. The room was a standard , but almost felt like a mimi suite because of its size and its living area. I was very impressed with the room considering the daily rate was less then the tax in other hotels I have stayed in. Another nice point to this hotel is that they have a large selection of great places to eat for very cheap. The Buffet was decent, not the best I have had, but still very enjoyable and inexpensive. Room service was very fast and well priced also. The Orleans pool was not quite to the luxurious level of some of the fancy pools on the strip, but it was not overly crowded either. That is a huge plus. My friends staying at one of the more elite strip hotels even came over to the Orleans with me because their pool was just too crowded. I have been to fancy strip pools enough to know that it can be a nightmare looking for chairs. I did'nt do a lot of gambling at the Orleans, but the Casino was large and not to smokey or crowded.

Some comments in the forum were about the Saturday night check-in and whether the lines would be long. We arrived about 8PM and there was no line at all so check-in was a breeze. Rooms were in the new wing with good, not great views, of the strip at night. Breakfast was in the Cafe' and food was excellent with BIG portions. Shuttle to the strip was consistent and convenient. Did have to take a cab periodically though. This was our fifth stay and we have always been pleased with the people and services. Brought my mother-in-law with us for a return visit, gets around okay but uses a wheel chair for the distances associated with getting around in Vegas, she's 87. Its not Bellagio but we enjoy Orleans' atmosphere, casino and limits. My son and I also gambled at Imperial Palace, Ellis Island,Flamingo, Tropicana, Bally's, and Aladdin. The only place that disappointed us was Ellis Island because they didn't have \"THE\" craps table open and we had to play black jack since we had walked about a half-a-mile to get there from Bally's. Ate one night's meal at the Prime Rib Loft and had the best prime rib cut(Orleans' cut)of beef that I've had in years. All who got the prime rib agreed. We also had an excellent meal at the Au Sin(spelling?) restaurant in Paris and excellent heavy appetizers in the Forum(?) Restaurant near the lobby of Caesars' Palace prior to Celine Dion's show.

The hotel I stayed on the strip cost twice as much as the Orleans, and the rooms were not as nice, the casino sucked, the food was gross, but.. it was on the strip. That is what I was paying for. Its a couple of minutes to the strip and the shuttle always arriving/departing. Also, its one of those places that if you don't feel like leaving your hotel all day, there is enough stuff to do. The rooms were just average rooms, nothing fancy, but very clean. When in Vegas, who stays in their room anyway? So, why would anyone pay $300 a night?

We had paid with a credit card believing that the room we booked would be held for us. This turned out to be far from the truth. We booked a no smoking room. We don't really mind everyone smoking in the casinos otherwise we wouldn't go to Vegas. But we really don't want to sleep in a room that smells like a used ash tray. Sadly, that is just what was waiting for us at the Orleans. When we arrived at the hotel to check in we were told that all that was left were smoking rooms. We explained to the clerk that we had booked a no smoking room clear back in January and had already paid for the room. She said that they can't guarentee the room you get. I must, however say that we did get in to Vegas late because our flight had been delayed. We arrived at about 11:00pm. The clerk was very rude to us and plainly did not care about our problem. We were given a choice to either take a smoking room or not have a room. I asked if it would be possible to get a no smoking room that next day. The clerk said she would put in a request for it and asked if we still wanted the room. Needless to say that at 11:00 at night we did not have to much of a choice. We spent a very sleepless night in the smoking room. The next morning we went down to have breakfast and check on the status of our already paid for room that we did not get. To make a long story short we were told to keep checking back three times . We got the room but wasted a whole day. We got the room at 3:00pm. We found the service bad and will not stay at the Orleans again. We contacted the Coast Casinos and didn't any answer back from them for two weeks. They just said that they hoped our next stay would be better. We decided to not spend any more money at the Orleans or gamble there .

My sister had to do a ton of paperwork as a result. We went bowling and the kids did enjoy it until some guy on a power trip shut off their game in the 8th frame. I complained, again, and no one cared. They said it was because we had an extra player, which was BS, as everyone had shoes and we were on our second game! Also, you may also want to keep in mind the price of cab rides, very expensive, if you go someplace else or don\u2019t feel like walking. We went from our hotel to Fremont Street, $20 one way! We did use the shuttle to Barbary Coast and found it to be a bonus, plus the driver was friendly. Oh yah, I really like the amount of security at this hotel. The bottom line is I won\u2019t stay at this hotel again and here's why 1) I found it expensive, but what isn't in Vegas these days 2) it is far away from everything else, referring to the the strip and Fremont, and 3) the management staff was not very accommodating and/or considerate, which makes a big difference.", "title": "It's was Okay", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "grace_73", "date": "May 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 5055675}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "I stayed at the Orleans May 4-8, 2006.
