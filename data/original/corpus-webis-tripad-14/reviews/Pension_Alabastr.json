It was very clean and the breakfast of yogurt and cold meats and coffee was fine to start off the day. Rooms are very basic and not soundproofed so you wouldn't want to spend more than a couple of nights here just in case. However it was very good value for money though a little basic. Allowed to check in early. Very easy to get to from the airport bus then metro Mustek. Very central we walked everywhere. All in all if you are just spending 2 nights exploring Prague then its fine.", "title": "Fine as a base", "user": "PerthLIz", "date": "November 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 183972738}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, all the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.
