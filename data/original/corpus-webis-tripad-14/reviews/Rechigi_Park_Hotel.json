We had no reservation, but decided to spend one night in Modena on our drive between Cinque Terre and Venice. Found this hotel on Tripadvisor, and were pleasantly surprised. Among our favorite hotels from our trip. It's located an easy 10-minute drive to Modena's old town, and there's plenty of parking! Part of a very elegant Italian chain of hotels (Space Hotels); we'll definitely choose another from this chain on our next trip to Italy. The restaurant is supposedly very good, but we ate in old town. When we returned from dinner, several locals were still sitting around the restaurant after their dinner. Always a good sign when the locals eat there.", "title": "A great find, excellent value", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "kellsand", "date": "June 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 31671515}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled on business", "text": "This is an elegant and comfortable hotel. I have stayed on business several times and always find the staff friendly and efficient. The hotel was originally a private villa and retains many fine features. The rooms are small by US standards. One big plus point is the really outstanding restaurant. Although in the same building it's actually owned and operated separately. The hotel reception can make a booking for you. This is essential as the restaraunt is very small. Trust me the food is excellent. Also, if you buy a beer in the bar you get a huge variet y of free nibbles that almost amount to a meal.
