What can I say...it's a small hostel/hotel property in the PERFECT location! The rooms are simple, but comfortable. They include a private bathroom, a queen & twin bed (great for spreading your luggage!), a little closet, fridge, A/C, ceiling fans and cable tv. We only paid around $45 US per night, so we didn't expect much, but they over exceeded our expectations! The staff was wonderful...all of them! They helped us book discount trips and recommended places to eat and go. There is a small kitchen that you can use too; we ended our 3 wk tour of Aussie there, so it was great to finally cook for ourselves! The hotel itself is literally across the street from the Esplanade, right next door to the night markets and a 2 minute walk to \"town\". You are in the middle of EVERYTHING! I think it's probably the best location in Cairns. We did a couple of tours on the water and we were able to walk to the boat in less than 5 minutes. The Esplanade pool is beautiful and very well kept and there are tons of little gas stove/grills at the park for anyone to enjoy! There was always some kind of free entertainment going on there, which was really fun! There are plenty of places to go out at night too...just depends on your style. If you're a beer drinker, try the Carlton Mid, it's great! Another tip, if you want to try Kangaroo meat (like us) don't bother spending $30 for a meal at one of the local restaurants, buy some at the grocer and cook it yourself at the park. We spent $4 US and got 3 steaks! Oh, you have to go to the night markets and try one of the Chinese full body massages! They end up being like $12 US and are TOTALLY worth every penny! We went twice and wish we could have gone more! Bottom line, if you're looking for luxury, go elsewhere. If you want a great hotel/hostel in a fantastic location for an awesome value, this is your place!

There is also a fridge for you to keep anything cool in, and we had a double and a single bed. If you book a trip via the hotel then they will let you leave your bags there for free if you want to shoot off somewhere for a few days and not lug everything with you, otherwise it only costs a few AUS per day. The place is right on the Esplanade almost opposite the lagon swimming pool (open and free to everyone), just minutes walk from shops, internet cafes, food places and the train station. The hotel itself has a small pool out the back and a video room as well as cooking and laundry facilities and a general get together area. It is quiet at night so you can get a good sleep if you want, but not too far from \"where its all at\" if you want to go out and party.

It is also on the same strip as the night markets, which, if you stay in Cairns at some point...you have got to visit - they're awesome. Also, on the next street up are internet cafes and every saturday there is a little market on the lagoon area, right outside the hostel.
