Since we usually travel with young kids and the fact that this hotel lacks a pool and/or lacks \"kid friendly\" activities was a reason we booked elsewhere in the past. Finally, we get a weekend away without the kids so we made our reservations. After some shopping in the area, we decided to spend the evening onsite, taking in the casino and the \"Epic\" buffet dinning room. The enclosed parking garage would be a positive amenity especially for those snowy/rainy days not to mention it is free. One thing about this property has going for it is that it is clean and the onsite casino is great selling feature for those looking to challenge the House for the jackpot. The bed was very comfortable with no issues. But outside of this, I can not say that we will run back to the hotel. In my opinion, for Bangor, it is overpriced. I can only assume that since we made our booking with an online wholesaler thus the reason for assigning us an ADA/Americans With Disabilities Act room (save the better rooms for the rack rate payers?) because we checked-in well before the majority of rooms would have been even assigned. Since it was an ADA room, the room was overly spacious and the bathroom lost some of the appeal found in other rooms since the counter space was reduced and the walls were covered with handles and an addition shower sprayer. Several deficiencies that we noticed: a lack of water pressure (I've stayed at many high rise hotels and this should not be an excuse) and limited control of A/C or fresh air. I was not impressed that check-in actually pre-charges $50 on your credit card \u201cin case of incidentals\u201d and then say that it may take up to 5 days for the refund to appear on your card. How about this? Charge me when I actually have incidentals!? The onsite buffet restaurant, just off the casino floor, was ok but for $17 per person, we expected more. The service was wonderful it was just that the food lacked variety and different flavors and we left with the impression that much of the food was pre-cooked. I think it is wonderful that Bangor has such a neat hotel (casino, downtown, adjacent to the Center), I just find that the price is set to high for the market leaving one to expect more than what they would typically get for a hotel found on the Odlin Road. Hollywood Slots Hotel is great spot to enjoy an onsite casino but if you\u2019re looking for value and you\u2019re not interested in gambling, look elsewhere.", "title": "Win with Clean & Comfort; Loss on Value", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "September 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 140885298}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Beautiful Hotel.Everything you need in one spot.Close to shopping and sightseeing.We found we didn't have to leave the Hotel.The Buffet spread was superb with a great selection of food.The staff was very friendly and made you feel at home.Rooms were clea and,spacious with high end furnature.As an added Bonus we went to the Casino and played the slots.Parking garage was great as well with entrance to Hotel.All in all we were very pleased with this Hotel.We have had the pleasure of staying here on 2 occassions and would definately stay here whenever possible.", "title": "Hotel with Class", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Everglade62", "date": "September 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 140803667}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "What a pleasant surprise.

Room 517. The room we had was a double queen room. When we got to the room it was very clean and had a flat screen tv on the wall, a desk and chair, another chair with ottoman, the 2 night stands and a bureau under the tv. There was also a little closet next to the bathroom with a safe, and ironing board inside. After we got settled in we went downstairs to play some slots. Overall the slots were a little tight but not too bad and we had a fun time with them. At 5pm I had a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free of the buffet so we decided to eat there. I will not do that again. The food had been sitting out for quite some time and was dried out. My husband tried a piece of their pizza and it was so hard he couldn't even bite into it. They really need to make sure they turn the food around better there. For $17 a person, it wasn't worth it in my opinion. We did most of our eating at the Take 2 snack bar. The food there was very good and very reasonably priced. The staff at the hotel and in the casino was very nice and very courteous. My husband had broken his glasses at a slot machine and can't see without them and a slot attendant came to his aid and looked up my players card to find me in the casino. Once she found me she brought to him to help him fix his glasses. Always a good thing to play with your players card!

It was very convienent to the airport. The buffet was excellent. We had our grown daughters with us and we all stayed in seperate rooms. The girls enjoy the music entertainment while we enjoyed playing the slots. Rooms were very clean and spacious. And it had a fabulous fitness center.

We have been here a few times and are always impressed by the hotel (nice and clean) and the friendly staff. The rooms are exceptional with a flat screen TV, (a) large comfortable bed(s) and a nice bathroom with a large shower. This last time there was a wedding party at the hotel and we expected to hear noise with all of the extra people partying but we were pleasantly surprised to find a very quiet night. I think this is partly due to the well built rooms. The hotel is fairly new and because it is completely non-smoking (due to Maine state law), it seems that the \"newness\" is lasting. The only downside that I would say, is that it has limited activites outside of the casino. There is a nice workout room but no pool or hot tub. In the area you can go to the Maine Mall which is not very far away or to the racetrack in the summer which is across the street. When you stay at the hotel, the buffet breakfast by the casino is free and is also excellent.", "title": "Great deal, wonderful NON SMOKING hotel", "user": "LadyLuckNewHampshire", "date": "September 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 45345426}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel is at the Hollywood Casino Bangor Maine.

I was surprised at how much space we had in the king bed room. Check in was a little slow and figuring out how to get into the parking garage was an ordeal lol. Access to the parkade wasn't explained by the front desk. After check in you have to exit the garage, turn left, then follow the road around to the left. The entrance is there on the left. I exited, turned right, then came around, reentered the garage from Main street only to end up back at the check in. Finally figured it out!

In fact, it was hard to believe it was even a casino. So quiet!! The beds were comfy and the room was clean and well appointed. We were only there overnight so I can't speak to many of the services and such, but my husband did enjoy the casino for a few hours. Also, we requested a pack and play for our toddler and they brought it up and assembled it right away.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars was because it was a little bit pricey.

Maybe my expectations were too high - after Foxwoods, this place seems like a wanna-be. I tried to separate my hopes to what I was actually seeing... but it still didnt do well. Hotel is not full - parking garage is almost vacant - yet they put me in a second floor room with a view of a brick wall. Signage outside was confusing, took me two rounds to manuver the parking garage. One girl at the lobby desk, no one else around. Very small lobby. Much more impressive reception at the local Hilton Garden Inn or the Marriott Courtyard. No information in the room about the casino or eating establishments. No info about amenities. No pool. Exercise room ridiculously small - 3 treadmills for a 7 floor hotel. Business center is laughable. I still dont know why this place is called a Raceway. All employees were friendly and courteous and willing to help when I asked questions....the casino was okay; mostly slot machines - not very big. SMOKE FREE which was fabulous and a first for me!! EPIC buffet was fair. Some foods not looking that appetizing but the prime rib was very good. Price was a little high for the choices available but not outrageous.
