My daughters and I were very impressed with the hospitality we received and the comfortable and contemporary look of this hotel which is only two years old. Our rooms were quite spacious with comfortable beds and furnished quite nicely. After checking into our rooms we received a call asking if everything was to our satisfaction and if we needed any assistance please let them know. This overture was appreciated. To add to our convenience were nearby restaurants and the fact that the hotel was also set back away from traffice and noise. Since we had a very early flight out of Scranton airport the next morning, to our surprise, there were on the go lunch bags filled with breakfast snacks for us and other travelers set up in the lobby area. Just another wonderful gesture we thought was a sign of hospitality that you do not see often in hotels these days.
