The venue was very beautiful and you could not fault the grounds and public rooms within the property. The entire time there was run with great efficiency and all food served was of a very high standard. The only change I would like to see is for draft larger / beer and real ale to be available from the bar (looked a bit cheap being when the beer was poored from a can!)", "title": "Beautiful Wedding venue - Accomodation needs some attention", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jb812", "date": "June 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114472693}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The bedrooms were of a reasonable standard and the decor was very pleasent, however the matresses were of a very poor quality and did not allow for any quality sleep (you could feel every spring).

The attention to detail with regards to our wishes for our wedding was not great though. Quotes were wrong, wine incorrectly listed, bar tab on the night was wrong and spirits were included when they shouldnt have been - and more. All were relatively small issues but for a venue like Somerford and the price you pay i would have expected a lot higher level of service.
