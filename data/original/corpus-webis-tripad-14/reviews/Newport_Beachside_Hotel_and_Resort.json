I have never been treated so rudely from a hotel in my life. I really had a loss for words. They sold our room out when we got there after it was already paid for. So we got the \"executive suite\" which was more like the basement of a motel 6. On the last day of our stay, they said they mistakenly gave us the room and said we had to either leave the hotel or move rooms after we were already paid for. The rooms are decorated horrifically. It looks like all the decor was bought from big lots or a flea market. The rooms were dirty, the hotel was very dirty and smelled. They charge you around $20 extra dollars per day for no reason except for things that usually come free with most hotels. Charged us $250 for a comforter because of a small coffee stain, did not even notice until I got home and checked my card statement. Absolutely the worst hotel experience of my life. I really hope this place is up for demo. This place spent 10 times more money on thier curb appeal than the overall quality of the hotel and the rooms. SOMEONE FROM THE CLEANING STAFF STOLE MY DIGITAL CAMERA! They also tried to hide my brand new $250 sunglasses by stashing them behind the dresser! dont leave anything out!", "title": "absolutely horrible service", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "biggstmack", "date": "April 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 15126033, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 on the beach", "disliked": "\u2014 the staff of the hotel and the hotel itself"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a great stay at the Newport Beach Resort, staying for 4 nights in a lovely ocean view suite.

It is much smaller and affords no privacy between beds like the picture shows. Also the site stated that all rooms had a balcony and they do not. Beach is really nice and so is the pool. hot tub closes at dark which is when most adults want to use it. it is full of children during the day and with only 4 people allowed at a time we never had a chance to actually get into it. elevators are slow and always full. staff very uninformed- could not answer questions we had about the area. there are 2 computers available in the lobby so you can search for local attractions. all attractions are a distance from the resort. no parking at the resort at all. you must pay $10 per day to park across the street behind a gas station. will cost you $15 per day to get a valet to park for you in the same place. NO security for your vehicle is offered. you will also be charged a $10 per day resort fee which the resort site informs you of, but we still have not figured out what it is for. if you want towels outside for the pool or beach you must get in line at a designeated area by the pool, sign for them and if you do not return them to the same place when done you will be charged $20 per towel. you must also rent the umbrellas, and tiki huts to use on the beach if you want one. they are not included with the price of your stay. Game room/arcades could not hold our 13 year olds attention. very few games and most were not working properly. the television channels are terrible!!! news or sex .... if you want to rent a movie it will cost you approximately $11 per movie. they do have a list of rental movies to choose from. just plan on no tv time while at the resort. house keeping will make your bed daily and remove items from the trash can but that is all. they did not clean floors or provide toilet paper. I had to go after toilet paper each time we needed it. on our last day house keeping keyed into the room, even though we had a do not disturb sign hanging on the door, and asked us if we were leaving. it was 8 in the morning and check out was not until 10. there is very little to do around the resort...a few stores and places to eat. no entertainment close. the resort advertises that they provide a lot of activites but they do not. people were wandering all over the resort looking like they had no idea what to do of an evening. lobby is very loud. the resort is not outdated looking like other reviews stated. it looks remodeled and is clean. there are 2 bars by the water. the pier/dock was closed the entire time we were there and has been for some time i gather. also, the resort photo shows that the resort sits kinda off to itself but it does not. there is a huge/tall condo type building towering close on each side. the photo must have been taken before the other buildings were erected. newport beach resort is the smallest building in the area. this place is perfect for adults who just want to get away and do nothing. don't take a family here with a lot of kids as they will be bored when not swimming. also, if you are not a water person this place is not for you as swimming is the entertainment. also, if you stay do not buy tickets from the resort for any outside area attractions. they have more than tripled the cost. buy the tickets online or at the attraction. ft. lauderdale is close and has things to do so does miami and hollywood. you will actually be staying in sunny isles beach if you choose this resort and there just is not a lot here to do so plan on traveling if you seek adventure or activities. the resort does advertise that they have a lot of water activities....this entails of a jet ski ($70 PER 1/2 HOUR), and canoe which also cost extra. If you book your reservations through a third party the staff at the resort will not attempt to help you if there are any problems with your reservations. they will tell you it is out of their hands and indicate that you must take up all issues with whoever you made your reservations through. I think it important to know this. so if your price of stay differs from what you thought you was paying they will not fix the error, if you booked a balcony room and the resort has another room for you then you will not get the balcony......just a couple of examples.", "title": "great hotel and value", "user": "jerseyguy27", "date": "July 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8087515}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is a great hotel and value especially if you have kids. location is great... near beach , has lively pool and activities for kids with counselors!!

(especially since the weather sucked and we had rain 4 out of 6 days and spent a good amount of time in the room.) I have no complaints about the accomidations and the spa tub was a nice bonus. I will warn you that the rooms do smell of smoke a bit, mostly because you can't open the windows to get fresh air in and there's no ventilation. For me and my traveling companions, 2 of us are smokers and the third didn't complain at all about the smell. I've smelled worse in other hotels and with the heat and the wind there I can see why they don't have a way to air it out.

The activities for kids and adults were both fun and entertaining. The pool area was well kept and clean. The beach was awesome with the huts and palm trees, giving it a tropical feel.", "title": "The most incredible time ever!!!!!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Terry L", "date": "June 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17032067, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location, staff, activities", "disliked": "\u2014 can't really think of any."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Overall, Michelle and her staff made our vacation one to remember.", "title": "Had a Wonderful Experience!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mamachev", "date": "June 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 17030673}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Much better than expected and we are picky!", "text": "Thanks to everyone at the Newport beachside!!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lizzyNJ", "date": "June 2, 2008", "id": 16604325}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed at the Newport for one night prior to my cruise departure with my husband and six year old.
