Basically the rooms are the same except the more expensive room has a kettle etc. and air conditioning. In summer it is hot and sticky so if you can afford it an upgrade may be worth the extra cost.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Dexter48507", "date": "November 1, 2004", "id": 2799474}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Palatinus Hotel is a Jewel", "text": "I recently attended a wedding party held in the Palatinus Hotel on Kiraly U. in Pecs, Hungary.

We did not stay there, but the room prices are very reasonable, too.
