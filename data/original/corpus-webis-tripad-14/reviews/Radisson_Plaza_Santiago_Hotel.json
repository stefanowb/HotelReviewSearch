If anything, it was a bit too much, as the staff were always hovering to see if you needed help when in the lobby or restaurant. The hotel itself is quite nice, with spacious rooms and is very clean. The all-you-can-eat breakfast was great, with a lot of choices and fresh-squeezed juices. We also received a free pisco sour at the bar, which we definitely appreciated. The only thing is that the hotel is far away from the downtown core, as it is in the business/upper end part of town. Having said that, I would probably stay here again because, even though it is far from things like La Moneda and the bus/train stations, there is a subway stop very close to the hotel (Tobalaba). It is less than a five minute walk to the station and the subway is cheap and fast, with no transfers needed to get downtown. Also, you can walk to Cerro San Cristobal from the hotel, which is a lovely park. It is about 20-25 minutes away. I would recommend not eating around the hotel though, the restaurants are overpriced and touristy.", "title": "Wonderful hotel, but a bit far from downtown", "user": "YOW76", "date": "January 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 53222109}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a executive hotel, with all you can expect from this kind of staying.

On the one hand, it is decently-located though in a busier section of Santiago. The best part is the staff, who from check-in desk, concierge, repair people, bartenders to car drivers, work very hard at providing a high level of service. The lobby is attractive. The small bar is cute. The hotel is in walking distance to many restaurants and the subway. The rate is average to slightly above average for Santiago. The free breakfast is extensive though doesn't change up and is of only average quality. The rooms need a facelift. They are dark, somewhat dingy and in need of maintenance. Our shower head leaked all over. A lamp did not work. Immediately upon complaining, however, a repair person was dispatched to resolve the problems. Although I was told I had a view and tranquil room, we were awakened every morning to the din of heavy Santiago traffic. The pillows were dirty.

Breakfast was adequate without being outstanding, the scrambled eggs looked unappetising and fried eggs or omelettes were not readily available.
