I travel to St. Thomas regularly and my hotel choice over these past ten years has been the Ritz-Carlton. My first visit was about ten years ago. At that point I hadn't had a vacation for over seven years. So I thought I would splurge and treat myself to an indulgent stay at the Ritz Carlton. Since I've been traveling on my own, I thought I'd never spend tons of money on a hotel room. I thought it was a waste of my hard earned money. My thought process has always been \"if the room is clean and comfortable, that's all that matters.\". YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE OUT A SECOND MORTGAGE TO FIND ONE! I have tried and tried to open my mind by staying at other resorts on the island but nothing compares to the oppulance the Ritz Carlton provides, and this oppulance is not just limited to the voluptuous visuals throughout the resort. The accomodations are oppulant. The service is oppulant. Every guest is treated like kings and queens. I can't say enough about this resort. Don't skimp when it comes to your getaway. In the end you always get what you pay for. Afterall, you deserve it. You won't go wrong investing in the Ritz for your next vacation.

All I can say is that is was absolutely fantastic. We stayed in the Begonia building and it was in very close proximity to everything from the food areas to the pool and the beach. The resort fee of $35 per day included all of the water activity sports among other things. It was well worth it if you spend a lot of your time there at the Ritz. You could paddleboat, windsurf, hobie cat, barracuda, snorkel, etc. The pool area, the beach and the surrounding grounds were beautiful and well maintained. What struck us the most was how polite and courteous and very helpful everyone was, from the grounds people to the conceirge desk. Everyone went out of their way to help you and \"always\" acknowledged you. We had the bed and breakfast package and the morning breakfast buffet was mouthwatering. I'm not much of a breakfast person but I actually looked forward to this each day!!! The view each morning was magnificent and the food was very good!! I miss that very much. Every evening at The Grille and the outdoor bar area there was a steel drum band playing live. We looked forward to enjoying them every evening after we returned from our evening stroll around the grounds. The prices for dinner are a bit pricey but there are other options. We had rented a car and were very glad that we did!! It takes a little getting used to (not much but a constant reminder from the wife to \"stay left\") but it was well worth it. We ate at \"Off the Hook\" in Red Hook and also at \"Whale of a Tale\" in Red Hook. Another great eating place is within walking distance from the Ritz. It's called \"Robert's\" and it is at the Elysian Resort which is next door. It was a very average place but the food was extremely good and service was also. Make sure you order dessert!!! Here are some neat ideas to do when you are there. We did the Reef Bay Trail Hike over on St. John Island. You must reserve this in advance. Check it out when staying at the Ritz. Also, take a trip to the British Virgin Islands if you can. We chartered a boat with no more than 12 people called \"Pirate's Penny\". It left Red Hook at about 7:45am and picked up another couple in St. John. Then we were on our way to a day of great fun. We traveled around Tortola and then stopped at Virgin Gorda. We snorkeled and also saw The Baths at Virgin Gorda. Then we ate lunch on Cooper Island and then stopped for more snorkeling at Norman Island. What a fabulous day we had. If you have never snorkeled (which I hadn't) please don't give up. Keep trying until you feel comfortable with it. It's well worth it seeing the beautiful world under the water. All in all, this was a wonderful trip and we would certainly go back to the Ritz.

Upon arrival we were told that we would be in a club room ($535 per night), not a club suite, and no club suites would be available during our stay. I should mention that a suite is twice the size of a room. We had booked through RC central reservations and had proof of our suite reservation (and, by the way, we had paid a deposit for a suite for three of the five nights!). The manager was not on the premises so the concierge of the club room handled the situation. A nice guy but not prepared to handle this situation. I was ready to hop over to Caneel but my husband negotiated a significant deduction in the price of the club room--$335 per night. That was a fair deal but very disappointing from a Ritz Carlton when celebrating your 25th anniversary. I have no proof of this but I think they overbooked the club accommodations and put us in a room because there were only two of us. I noticed that everyone walking out of a suite was a family of three or four. Having said that, our stay was quite nice. The room was fine (equivalent to our club room at the Four Seasons Maui). Grounds and pool were lovely. The view is unbelievable. We did not eat on property (other than the club room which was excellent and plentiful). We ate at Havana Blue, Old Stone Farmhouse, Off the Hook, Agave Terrace and ZoZo's in St. John. None of these were inexpensive and all involved a hefty cab fare. The food was good (7 out of 10) but views were outstanding. At checkout, we had a $134 credit due to our suite deposit so that was nice.

I agree with the previous comments - the Ritz is the best place to stay on the island if you are accustomed to top quality accommodations. Sure, there are things that could be improved upon and for the price of a per night stay there should be nothing to improve upon. But, when you stop to think of the normal grind at home versus the beauty of the hotel the items needing improved don\u2019t seem all that major. The surrounding areas are less than appealing and the drive seems a little intimidating but after a few trips in and out of the hotel you get used to the views or lack of.... Items requiring improvement: (1) Service at the restaurants - the Palm Garden Cafe in particular -- it took Walter 26 minutes to bring two cups of coffee and dessert. The cafe was not crowded and the order was painfully simple but alas this is the islands and we are on vacation.... (2) Broken tiles in the villa area -- I know this sounds petty but as we walked up the stairs to our room daily I could not help but notice the missing/cracked tiles on the stairwell. Again, this may be petty but the Ritz is known for the utmost perfection in all aspects. (3) The cleaning staff needs to be more thorough (the rooms were very CLEAN - please don't misinterpret) just little issues like sweeping the floors better - replacing a robe .... Now for the good stuff -- the positives: (1) The hotel and grounds are beautiful - the views are just gorgeous!! (2) The resort fee is fabulous - for the $35/day you have unlimited use of the \"toys\" on the beach - and they have several items (i.e. not just one kayak, or one windsurfing board....) and the gang that operates this area is quick to respond to any need you may have. (3) The beaches are beautiful and have just been equipped with new chairs. The towel staff is quick to respond to your needs and will move chairs and umbrellas anywhere to satisfy you. (4) The Lady Lyndsey is great for sailing and snorkeling. Again Capt. Mickey and his crew could not be more accommodating. All you need to do is sit back relax and enjoy the view. I would highly recommend this activity. My husband and I ate at every venue at the resort. All were good not great just good - but oh so convenient!! The service seems to be slow across the board but they do their best to make you happy. For instance, I read the reviews about the Great Bay Grill and the \"Bright Lights/Cafeteria Style Lighting...\" - all this is true - the lights were way too bright. So when he hostess came past I simply asked her to dim the lights which she did immediately and then came back to the table and asked if I was satisfied or should they be dimmed further? Where else are you going to get this service and respect? So for those of you who think the lights are too bright just asked for them to be lowered and your request will be quickly accommodated. All in all this was a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation for my husband and me.
