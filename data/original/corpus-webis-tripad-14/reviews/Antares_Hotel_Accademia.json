The hotel is around a 10 minute scenic ride on the tram from the Duomo, and is facing the Portello shopping centre which has absolutely everything you want from high fashion and designer things, to more practical shops for everyday requirements. It seems that the managers concentrate on training their staff well as the service was excellent, and the rooms absolutely top notch and seemingly recently refurbished. After having completed my work requirements, my wife came out and we enjoyed Milano for the weekend. Had heard that it was not the primary tourist destination of Italy, but we found it very beautiful and thoroughly enjoyable! Great city centre, with shops bars and restaurants as well as the usual historical and architectural beauty Italy is famed for. It was even close enough to the San Siro Stadium for me to enjoy an Inter league game (while the wife busily completed her shopping extravaganza) before flying out late Sunday night.", "title": "Great Location - Stylish Hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "JayGreco", "date": "December 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 11258930, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great location - quality rooms and service", "disliked": "\u2014 Restaurant was a little quiet"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "My husband and I stayed in this hotel for two nights at the end of April with some friends.

Firstly getting to the hotel was dificult as we followed the directions from the hotel web page, but we found out they were out of date. We tried to catch a trolley bus and was wanting the 33 as mentioned on the hotel web page. it is now the 19 or 11 that you need to catch. We ended up getting a taxi to the hotel from the Central Station which cost 15 euro. On arrival at the hotel the staff were ok, I wouldnt say over friendly as stated in some reviews. The room was very nice - modern, spacious and clean. We headed over to the shopping centre which many people mentioned in their reviews. Well worth it too. The supermarket is fab, and we had a drink at the cafe. There is a bar on the way to the supermarket which we found very reasonably priced - 2 euros for a large beer instead of the 5 euros that you would expect to pay. We were dissapointed with the breakfast. yes there was a choice. The waitresses were on the miserable side. 2 out of the 3 days they never gave us any milk for our tea and coffee so we used the milk from the cereal section. The bacon and sausage were not very good and the egg was dry. We sampled the hotel bar which is in the basement. I think it would be better located where they serve the breakfast on the 5th floor and open the doors to the terrace. However all in all it was a decent hotel. We wanted to stay alittle out of the centre, and the location was fine. We did visit the San Sero, however we caught a tram into the centre and then a tram, I think it is number 16 to the San Sero", "title": "It was ok", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "seabie73", "date": "June 4, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 16658921, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the room", "disliked": "\u2014 the breakfast"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Although a little out of the centre, the hotel was easy accessible by public transport No's 14 & 19 from the Duomo.

So! back to the hotel.. It was quite nice, clean modern rooms, small bathroom, friendly staff.

But they did run out of eggs on the last day we were there but in all honesty we did arrive at the buffet a bit late. Spent a bit of a late night out haha. The room was very clean. The valet parking costs 20 euros a day which I found a bit high. But on the up side they did give us one day of free parking account the room we reserved was not available. So they offered us an additional room to make up for it but we did not consider it necessary so they dropped one day off the parking. The front desk spoke excellent english and were very helpful. The transportation cost is excellent. For 3 euros you can use all public transport all day. The trams are rather interested. I beleive a number of them are from the second world war and are quite loud but interesting. The thing I did not care for was the shower.
