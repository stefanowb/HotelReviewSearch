If a chef/cook does not understand what a marinade is they should not be there. The menu writer needs to train or explain to the cook what a dish is supposed to be. However, my starter (soup) and the dishes my wife ordered were ok - not special. Staff responded well with apologies when I complained and removed item from the bill. So not all bad but you don't expect that sort of problem in a supposedly quality place.

The lamb chop was cooked as asked for and tender off the bone but rather overpowered by substantial potato blocks lacking imagination as accompaniment.

There's a good range of food though nothing special given the prices. Service was pleasant but a bit brusque and amateurish - sauces offered after the main course, duplicated requests by staff asking if we wanted drinks when we'd already responded. It's very noisy here - the accoustics are terrible so I'd say fine for a night out with a group of friends so long as you don't want any in depth conversation.

The staff are good and the fact that the place is split into smallish rooms is no great problem for them. The food was not cheap and the quality was underwhelming. As main courses, my wife had a vegetarian tart which was a thin piece of pastry, rocket salad on top and a few chunky walnuts sprinkled over - oh and a sideplate of new potatoes which at this time of year are just not - difficult to eat and not very yummy. I had cod which was well cooked, sat on a bed of potatoes, hot and did not really inspire. The chocolate torte for pudding was a stodgy chocolate slice with some cream. Do not misunderstand me, it was all well cooked and could not be faulted but just a tad boring.
