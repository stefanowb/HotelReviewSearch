While not far, there is no escalator at the train station, and it is a bit uphill from the station. If you are not travelling light, it can be a bit of a slog.

We found the staff to be somewhat stand-offish , particularly Renato, who was not friendly, and not very helpful. Other hotels we have stayed at had owners who made it a point to anticipate travelers needs, for example having directions prepared for frequently asked destinations. We purchased some postcards, and asked whether we could purchase stamps for them. Not an uncommon request, but we were basically just pointed in the direction of the local post office. This may seem like nit-picking, and actually did not detract, for us, from the other very positive qualities of the hotel, but given some of the raves that staff have recieved, we expected more.", "user": "2vaca", "date": "July 12, 2007", "id": 8108569}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Nice place to stay!", "text": "My husband and I traveled to Switzerland and Italy for our honeymoon.

We have traveled extensively and found Renato the owner of the hotel to be a gracious host; placing customer satisfaction at a premium. The hotel had it all: centrally located; easy access to ferry, town; gelato and all restaurants. From the moment we walked into the newly renovated and spacious lobby, it felt like home. We were greated in English and Italian and thank goodness, because we didn't speak a word of Italian. We were then shown up to our HUGE and beautifully decorated room, with a terrace and beautiful and spacious bathroom. Even though there were only two of us, the junior suite was roomy enough to sleep 4 people comfortably. The price included a breakfast buffet which more than satisfied any tastes with its array of options. In the evening, it was nice to enjoy a glass of wine on the conveniently located patio. A word of advice; if you take the train to Monterroso, pay the 7 euros to take a taxi-we overpacked like typical Americans, so it was well worth it! The dress is very casual-i.e. shorts, capris, and jeans are welcomed. When we return to Cinque Terre, we will DEFINITELY visit Hotel Margherita!!!

Our room was lovely and although the bath room was smaller than most we had been in, the shower was powerful. Unfortunately we were in a room (#201) that was at the top of the staircase so we heard anyone and everyone that was coming up the stairs (unfortunately it was mostly obnoxious, loud Americans). The breakfast room was delightfully bright and I thought that the items served were totally adequate --- much better in fact than the prior 3 hotels in Italy that we had been to. I would definitely stay here again.

Although I've been to Italy several times it was my first time in Cinque Terre. Travelling with 7 - my wife, two kids, 79 yr. old father, sister-in-law, and nephew, it was the perfect respite from the heat and humidity in Rome. We arrived by train and took a taxi to Hotel Margherita - we'll worth the money if you have a lot of luggage. Renato checked us in and made us feel like we were family right away. My father speaks Italian so it made it a little easier. The breakfast lady (forget her name) is from Guayaquil Ecuador, so my Spanish came in handy too. Renato gave us each a complimentary beer upon check in (the kids cokes), and he sat and chatted with us. He broke out a jar of green tomatoes and olives that his mother canned for him, some bread, and we had a feast! The hotel was clean and modern and the rooms were spacious by Italian standards (was a little disappointed when we booked the junior suite with a balcony and ended up with a 1st floor (albeit large) handicapped room - not a problem but the kids got shower water all over the place as there was no tub at the bottom of the shower -- Room 1 if anyone is interested). Renato recommended (and made reservations) at two great restaurants for us. One a short walk from the hotel, the other on top of the mountain overlooking Monterosso (the restaurant has a shuttle van that brings you up and back). The beach is only a couple blocks away - the wife and the kids went to the beach while my father and I visited the other 4 villages. Totally comfortable environment to let the teenage kids wander around. The boys actually got involved in a basketball game with some locals at the little soccer/basketball court right in front of the beach. One night when we got back to the hotel, Renato broke out his special grappa for us to enjoy....he told us he had two bottles...one he sold to clients, the other he kept for himself...he shared his personal bottle with us....again making us feel at home....Lots of fun....I'd definitely go back and absolutely would stay at Hotel Margherita again.", "user": "buster1v", "date": "July 7, 2007", "id": 8072201}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "excellent stay in monterosso", "text": "hotel margherita is new, modern, clean and located in the heart of the old town. always quiet. strong water pressure with instant hot water. my single room was the size of most doubles. owner renato is on site 18 hours a day and sets the high standards for his cheerful, friendly & helpful staff of serena, francesca, & carmen. they were always a great help with restaurant recommendations, directions, boat schedules, etc.", "user": "mr_eye_7", "date": "July 6, 2007", "id": 8068456}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Disappointed.
