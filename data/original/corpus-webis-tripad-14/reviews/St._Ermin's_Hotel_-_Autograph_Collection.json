The bathroom was very small (you need to manoeuvre round the door carefully to get to the loo!) but had everything we needed. The shower over the bath was fine, towels were big and sparking white and the White Company toiletries very acceptable although I\u2019m a bit disappointed at the growing trend for London hotels to put \u201ccaptive bottles\u201d in bathrooms where you can never get quite enough product out in one go\u2026 Check in and check out went without a hitch and the staff were pleasant and professional. As we were working very late we had hoped to grab a bite from room service, but the menu was very limited \u2013 not too much of a disaster as there are numerous restaurants in this area so we just ate out instead.

The hotel seeks to present itself as a high-end 4 star and in terms of the friendliness and staff courtesy it is in 5 star territory. However, what really let the hotel down was that the room I was allocated had no natural light. I did not immediately notice when I arrived because it was dark and I had to work and by the time I did realise it was quite late in the evening. In the morning, however, it became clear that because the windows looked directly into another bit of the building they had been painted over. This may not make too much of a difference in January but in July it would have totally unacceptable, especially if working in the room. Had I been paying privately I would certainly have demanded a change. Another problem was that for a significant part of the second day there was no hot water in the hotel from early morning until late afternoon. The hotel was apologetic and I received a free breakfast upgrade to compensate so I don't hold it against them but what might otherwise have been a possible 5 star review cannot exceed 3 stars simply because of the painted windows.

The concierge was at the door of the taxi before we could get out and from there onwards the long week-end was fantastic! The entrance hall is extraordinary and feels like you are walking into a decorated wedding cake, all white and decorated plaster work ceilings. Warm and welcoming with fire places and seating in \"family\" settings make for a really positive immediate impression. The room we had was equally welcoming and the heating was effective and easy to control, the bed was large and one of the most comfortable we've encountered. Breakfast was excellent; we chose the continental style option which gave extensive choice, cereals, meats, cheeses, patisseries etc. The staff were charming and attentive, adding to the experience.

In fact, the reality is that it is a mix of all of these fine attributes that delightfully work together to create a warm and comfortable atmosphere- a perfect one in which to consume fine tea. The service found in the library was warm and intuitive- you are treated well, and your wishes met.

The rooms were immaculate, the beds were OH SO COMFORTABLE... it was hard to leave them in the morning! The in room coffee service was just the right touch to lure you awake.
