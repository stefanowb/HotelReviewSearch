It was my first stay with the HAGL Plaza Hotel in December 2010. My first evening there, the hotel was hosting the Christams Tree Lighting Ceremony and it invited its guests and local dignitaries to this event. Wines and beers were freely served by friendly employees. The planned foods ran out due to an enormous amount of people attending this event. Additional foods were brought down from the Top Floor lounge to accommodate the crowd. I really enjoyed meeting with the gregarious general manager and his local VIP guests. No one talked about the War, only us Americans still have not got over it. The local polticians and dignitaries talked about parties, good times, Cognacs of different types. No politics! Wow, what a different in 40 years when topics du jour were about bombing, killing, and war. Now business deals, cooperation, economic growth, are the topics. Anyway, I enjoyed being exposed to different perspectives and points of view.", "title": "Well managed property with friendly and attentive staff members", "user": "jhawksphan", "date": "December 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 90838449}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010", "text": "The room, a standard one to boot, has amenities that were not available to an average room in the States: slippers, robes, refrigerator, etc...
