The location to the wine country was perfect and having the nice city of Santa Rosa nearby was helpful. We had two breakfasts and one dinner at the adjacent restaurant, Lyons.

A free continental breakfast was listed, but not available. If you wish to spend about $8 they have a restaurant\u2013not a bad price for breakfast.
