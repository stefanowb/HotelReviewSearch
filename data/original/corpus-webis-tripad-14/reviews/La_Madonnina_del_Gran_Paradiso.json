I've stayed here twice over the years, in 2009 and in 2007. It is very well situated with a beautiful view of the meadow. It is about a five minute walk or less to the center of Cogne. From here you can easily walk to some of the different hikes that are available. The family that runs the hotel is very welcoming and provide good information about the walks and hikes around Cogne. The hotel offers breakfast and dinner and both are ample and delicious. The owner is definitely trying to keep the restaurant fresh. One day he offered pancakes, which you never really see in Europe (I'm talking American style pancakes, not crepes) but most of the cooking focuses on the specialties of the region which are hearty mountain fare. They also have a nice wine list representing all regions of Italy. If you want an active or quiet mountain vacation, this beautiful hotel with great food and service will not let you down.", "title": "Can't wait to return", "user": "badwaiter", "date": "May 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 65101134}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "This is small family-run hotel on the edge of Cogne but in easy walking distance of the village with its very good visitor facilities.
