The Crystal Peak Lodge is a great place to stay. Everything from the location, ski lockers, ski and snow board rentals are perfect. The rooms and the lodge itself are perfect and super clean. They provide room cleaning service daily. The staff was very willing to help in any way. And the undergroung heated parking was a plus (especially with the 18' of snow that we got). The lodge is only down the street. You could either use the shuttle of Crystal Peak Lodge or you can drive. You are also to take the gondola (which is right outside your door) to town during the day if you would like, but the gondola does stop running around 5:00pm. The hot tub and fitness were very clean too. Ther fitness facility consists of a steam room, two tread mills, elipital trainer and two bikes. It also has bumbells up to 50 or 60 pounds and a universal nautilus type machine. And two adjustable benches. It is an adquate facitily to do some cardio and some light wights and abs.
