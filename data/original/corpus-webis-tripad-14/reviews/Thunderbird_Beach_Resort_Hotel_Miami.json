What a super deal for an older hotel right on a swimming beach. It is about an hour busride north from the busy part of Southbeach. We were glad to be away from the 24hr. noise. Shopping was good here, safe, beach- gorgeous, nightly hotel entertainment consisted of a singing DJ, with added piano, guitar or sax. The bar had one DJ and another in the restaurant. The hotel was apparently owned by a French Canadian from Montreal, lots of French speaking guests. The property was well kept, staff pleasant..location- good.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 25, 2007", "id": 6840064}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "This place was a time trip back to the fifties in decor and feel.
