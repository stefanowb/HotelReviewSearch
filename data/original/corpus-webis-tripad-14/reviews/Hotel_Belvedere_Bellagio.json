Our reservation, which I made 8 months in advance and had a written confirmation, was for 4 nights! The day of our arrival, we had traveled 8 hours on a train from Switzerland, then taken a ferry and finally a cab to get to the hotel. We arrived tired only to find that Elena, the manager, had given away our room to someone she felt needed the room more than we did \"due to medical reasons\". She didn't know anything about us, physically or otherwise, how could she make a unilateral decision like that? Moreover, the hotel was booked solid so she had already booked us into a pension (2 stars, tiny room) . There were no other comparable rooms in Bellagio that week due to an annual auto race being held at the same time. She kept saying \"you save money, you lucky!\" I was outraged and let her know it! She couldn't understand that the issue had nothing to do with money..... Finally the next day, after much ado, she moved us into a room that she said was an upgrade but it really looked like the room we had reserved. No compensation of any kind - no complimentary dinner, no nothing. The hotel was beautiful, the view magnificent, and Bellagio amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit of Lake Como and didn't let Elena's poor management ruin our visit. However, we cannot recommend this hotel since, obviously, a confirmed reservation means nothing to them. Other travelers may not be so lucky and it may ruin their vacation.

It is a nice spot that looks out on the water. We had a few issues with the staff and the room. The staff was not very friendly and seemed to want the guests to \"move on\" rather than provide assistance. It seemed like we were bothering them if we asked a simple question. We asked the front desk for advice on which town to visit by ferry, her response, a very short, \"where do you want to go?\" On arrival at the hotel at about 2.30pm we asked if we could get a light lunch. A very unfreindly barmaid brought us a cold dry ham and cheese sandwhich, when I asked for mustard she gave me a strange look and walked away. We asked that reservations be made at a restaurant, after making the phone call she simply said they are booked all night and turned her back on us. Later we found out from the same person that Tuesdays most restaurants are closed. Why didn't this person offer to make reservations at another restaurant during our first discussion. The breakfast staff went to the same charm school, barely a smile or good morning. They seemed intrested in getting the job of serving breakfast done and then hoping you'd get out of there asap. The room was acceptable, nothing special, but the bathroom was the size of a phone both. Also many of the rooms have security cameras with glaring red lights pointing at the patios. This did not add to the charm. After a period of time we grew to accept that \"someone was watching\", apparetly there has been some crime at the hotel and this was viewed as a deterrent.
