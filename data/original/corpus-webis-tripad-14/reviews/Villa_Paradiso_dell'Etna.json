What a joke. We arrived at the Catania airport late in the evening, our flight from Rome having been delayed and our luggage lost. (The luggage service at Catania airport said the next day \"Your bag is probably here and it is probably not here.\" Later they said they had lost it. We went to the airport the next day, and it was sitting right there with about 10 other \"lost\" bags.

We drove around and around in circles looking for yellow signs, and there were none, at least none you could see at night. The area was totally shut down, no one on the street to ask. Our GPS unit was sending us in even more cicles. Finally we pulled into a self sevice, unattended gas station. By now it was 11 p.m. and the whole area was deserted. A guy pulled up in another car, and we asked him, in our faulty Italian, if he knew where the hotel was. He seemed to tell us he would go with us, and we declined. He clarified that we would follow him, so we did, following him down about 20 different winding roads, alleys, etc. until about 15 minutes later we arrived at the hotel. We would have NEVER found it without the help of this good Samaritan.", "title": "Nightmare", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "balci", "date": "September 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5829555, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 running away from it", "disliked": "\u2014 staff"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2006", "text": "When we arrived at the hotel, we picked up their brochure.
