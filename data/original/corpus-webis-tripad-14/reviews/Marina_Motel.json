To my disappointment, it was average at best. I made reservations months in advance for a room with a kitchen for my husband and I and our 2 dogs. When I called to confirm, they told me there were no rooms with kitchens available. OK... so we had a smaller room. The parking IS free, but the cars are so crammed in that it's next to impossible to get in and out. But my biggest complaint is the NOISE! There were noisy cars in the courtyard, paper thin walls, and a noisy staircases with people going up and down all night. Needless to say, none of us got much sleep. It is difficult to find a hotel that accepts pets, and they were very accommodating. But I just don't think this hotel deserves the raves that others' have given it.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 8, 2005", "id": 4001986}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed for 10 days at the Marina Motel.
