My wife enjoyed the seafood lasagna which she says was excellent.The second one was the chinesse there again the food was very good and i am not really one for chinesse food but i enjoyed it. The third one was the grill and was worth the wait.A word of advise book your a la carte asap because they book up really fast.The beach service was great they were more than happy to serve you drinks at 10a.m. if you chose too.The ocean floor was as smooth as the beach.Very windy in the afternoon but that was ok because it gave us a chance to enjoy the swim up bar were we met friends form around the world.(hello to shelly and john fromu.s eh and vickie and bobbie from england also joe and karens from wells xoxo).Even at the pool side they would come and serve you.At night we would take in the shows which were great and the animation team (Lucas, capuccino,and super Tino) got my wife up to dance which she rarly dances.The animation team works very hard to keep everybody entertained we love you guys.Every time you would see a staff member they always had a smile for you.Over all my wife and I talk about Blue Bay to our friends and family non stop.The only thing we would change about our trip would be more space room on the plane.My wife and I would go back to Blue Bay in a heart beat.We will be back(only 365days to go) thanks for everything guys from your friends in canada (Chris and Linda )XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "happygolucky38", "date": "March 7, 2008", "id": 14126689}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic Time Great Resort.

Also, AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVE and get your welcome package, book your A La Carte\u2019s with Guest Services. They fill up quickly and some days certain ones aren\u2019t open. Just remember not to book one on Tuesday night as they have a Managers Welcome Party along with a very nice dinner in the buffet. The A La Carte's are the Grill, El Dorado, an Oriental Infusion called the Jade Garden and a Seafood restaurant, El Pescador. The food was lovely at all of them, but I enjoyed the main buffet just as much, especially Thursday night when they had a Mexican theme. There was an amazing assortment of food at the main buffet every day. I am a vegan and my husband is a meat eater, but there was enough of an assortment that neither of us got bored. They even had soy milk for breakfast cereals! At the Grill A la Carte my husband ordered the chateaubriand. Be warned that it is meant for TWO people to consume but obviously wasn\u2019t something I was going to partake in. My husband was a bit embarrassed with the platter of food that came out but enjoyed it nonetheless. The Oriental Restaurant is open to other resort guests as well, but they have to pay. My husband had a Thai dish, along with a spring roll for appetizer and complimentary sushi. At the Seafood restaurant he ordered the calamari which unfortunately must have been sitting under a heat lamp for some time as they were so tough but he really enjoyed the linguini with prawns. All of the A la Carte's had vegetarian options that were easily made vegan for me. Also, be aware that your wine glass is bottomless. Every time I looked back, at a waiter was there refilling it. Lol. Also, we chatted with a few other guests and never heard anyone say anything bad about the food, or receiving anything undercooked. The only food we both did not enjoy was the pasta station in the main buffet as we found the pasta overcooked.

I checked tripadvisor and many other sites to find a perfect combination of what we and the other couple were looking for. I read the majority of the reviews on Blue Bay and like many others I was apprehensive that the reviews appeared almost \"too good\" and thought that maybe certain reviewers were given incentives for their favourable reviews. I can assure you after visiting this resort that this is not the case. Some of the issues brought up in the negative reviews are accurate. For instance the rooms are a little dark and the beds are definately hard. Also, the entertainment team have room for improvement and the beach is not the nicest that I have seen (in regards to esthetics). Yet some of the negative comments are complete hogwash. The food found throughout the resort is absolutely delicious and I have difficulty how anyone could possibly find fault in the service. I could not believe how friendly everyone was and how willing they were to ensure that your stay was enjoyable. The general manager, Oscar, was present throughout the week and he personally made sure that the bed was to my liking. The dining staff (waitors, etc) were always smiling and worked their behinds off to ensure that you never had an empty glass or dirty dish in front of you. The food was always beatifully prepared and I never left a single meal hungry. I especially appreciated the tasty low fat items and was pleasantly suprised to see how hot every meal was. Even the breakfast items were hot at all times. This is no small feet. I also appreciated eating in the open air buffet restaurant.
