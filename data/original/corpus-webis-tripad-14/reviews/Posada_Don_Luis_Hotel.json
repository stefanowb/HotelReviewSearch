We are going back soon for a second stay here. The desk manager, Alex, is very helpful... so is Consuelo. A light bulb burned out and was fixed IMMEDIATELY! It is not \"fancy\", but very clean and we were comfortable here. We had a room near the front on the upper level.. with a king size bed and cable TV. There are a few apartment-size rooms at the back... a hot tub... and a small swimming pool. It is not located downtown, but it is on the main street. We could walk out front and hail a cab right away for 60c to go downtown. There are a few restaurants nearby; Internet across the street; a laundry; bakeries; and a grocery store.... all within walking distance. If you like walking, downtown is about 1 1/2 miles, I think.

All the big resort hotels are very strict about bringing in your own ice chest because they want you to buy their drinks and they are not cheap.. The other big draw back is not all the big resorts have air conditioning in the rooms so to leave a window open with a fan on all night you don't get sleep with all the big clubs hopping all night long! The final thing with some of those big resorts are the rooms seem dirty, old and need updating.. The beds are concaved and you just don't want to put your head on them... This little treasure, Posada Don Louis has nice size rooms that are very clean, they all have air conditioners which in the summer I find a blessing. The rates are fair priced and I would definately stay again.

Once you get inside the complex, the main street noise goes away. There's a very small pool and jacuzzi. Any small group of people could take it over and not leave room for anybody else. They have some noise and horse play rules, but they are barely enforced so a rowdy group of kids can keep you up all night and out of the pool. Not close enough to be walking distance to the night life. Also not walking distance to the beach. It is a decent place to rest in between sight seeing, but not a place to hang out. It is fair priced. However, there's much more pleasant resort style hotels south of town.

The $75 room [#24] was quite large & fairly clean ,but a west facing window had no curtain so was very bright early. The shower water came out in one stream. The $85 room [#35] was a little nicer, plus I could park right in front. It came with a coffee maker, but the hotel does not supply coffee or filters! Ww both found the shower heat control impossible to ajust properly. On my next visit we might stay again on Saturday and move to a cheaper, nicer place on Sunday. Don Luis, unlike every other hotel does not reduce [about half most places] prices on Sundays. Hotel staff and everyone I met in Rosarito were very friendly. Hotel Calafia [some $45 rooms on Sunday] is stunning but serves expensive, small and very overcooked lobster.

We weren't expecting much as the price was low compared to other hotels in this area. The room was comfy and clean. Everything worked! Hotel was quiet. The hotel staff is exceptionally polite, friendly, and competent. We would especially like to compliment Alex and Consuelo for very good service. Any service request is taken care of immediately. There is a small pool and hot tub. Maids are pleasant and efficient. I am rating this above average because of the good value and service. Hotel is not in the center of town and has no beach, but taxis are about 60c... so you can walk or ride to the heart of Rosarito. Rooms are not fancy... not 5 star... but we were pleased and would be happy to stay here again! For dining we recommend the restaurant adjoining the hotel for convenience and good food; the Rosarito Hotel in town for great food at a good price; and the Calafia Hotel just south of town for a romantic gourmet meal.

First the staff, they were so friendly, helpful, professional. The lady at the front desk gave us tips on where to go to see things and directions whenever we needed them. The grounds are very beautiful, complete with a little garden where they are growing vegetables. The room was very nice. The shower was quite large, there was a refrigerator to keep drinks cold, the a/c worked perfectly. I had read reviews that stated that the water tempature was hard to control but I found no problem doing so. The pool was quite small but it had a good charm. I imagine with just a few it would be very nice, I did not swim while I was there. They have picnic tables around the pool in case you want to eat. The better aspect I believe is that the hotel rooms are in the back of the check in, off the street. Very safe for your vehicles. You can park right next to your room, which is what I did. And because it is off from the street there is virtually no noise. The price was rate fair. About $65 a night for the room I was in but they have some cheaper rooms for $35 if your on a budget. Just as nice except no refirgerator. The hotel had a feel about it. Almost like home. It was quite beautiful. They have an AMAZING restaurant in front. The have the best food, for the cheapest price. (But fair warning don't order anything large size unless your sharing it with someone, they are not joking on those portions) Overall this is a wonderful hotel. I highly recommend it and when I go back it is the hotel I instend upon staying in. It is a shame that they don't have photos of the place for all to see. I was having such a good time I simply didn't take any. But don't let that put doubt in your mind about this hotel.
