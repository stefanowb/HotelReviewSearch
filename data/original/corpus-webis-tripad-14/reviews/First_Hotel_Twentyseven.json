The hotel is in a great location, close to both the railway station and major attractions. It has been decorated in a very modern style but luckily without it getting sterile. In fact, the bar and lounge areas were very homely and cosy, especially during breakfast and dinner buffet hours when it almost felt like a large in-home dining room. The breakfast was fine, all service worked well and the room was functional - plus for the very comfortable bed. Also the complementary aperitif/dinner buffet was a pleasant surprise and actually had us skip dinner outside one night. The only little complaint I would have was on the cleanliness; our room was not the most spotless I have seen with eg. bread crumbles on the bedside table... But all in all, the experience was good and I would recommend this hotel to my friends.", "user": "Angie24B", "date": "February 24, 2008", "id": 13813152}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic Mojitos", "text": "Stayed here with 3 friends and couldn't have asked for more.
