We had asked for a one bedroom garden view unit and the one they gave us in fact had a limited view of the ocean so we were very pleased. There were just 2 of us and we were there for rest and relaxation so we liked the quiet location of our condo near the entrance to the property. The maid service was great and th unit was kept clean. Ours had a private owner and was very nicely furnished with everything we needed. We would certainly stay there again...and having read the reports of others I would probably request the same suite.", "title": "Palms was just what we were looking for", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "DorothyJ", "date": "February 24, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3229199}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Okay, but some problems", "text": "Going in February was great for whale watching...in fact you could see them spouting in the ocean from the terrace above the pool.
