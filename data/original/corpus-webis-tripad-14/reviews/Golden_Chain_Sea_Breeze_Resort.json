Jim recommended a place to get some seafood from and I can honestly say they were the best prawns I have EVER tasted. What I really loved about this place, though, apart from the friendly staff (and they were ALL friendly, withour exception!) is the location. What a fascinating place to spend some time!

I have stayed in Exmouth before, but this was my first time at Sea Breeze and I loved it. The facility isn't luxurious but it has everything you need and a few nice extra touches, just as you would expect from a US Navy built quarters. The rooms are functional, with a good kitchenette, GREAT hot water service (solar powered) and air conditioned. The pool and spa are great at the end of the day. The highlight of our stay was the friendly service and it is great testimony to the young enthusiastic staff (mainly backpackers). Instead of the tired & grumpy service you get in some places run by the owners, Sea breeze had a nice young smiling friendly ambience that really made it a stand out. The outdoor barbecue facility was a great way to met other travelers and to share experiences. Sea Breeze isn't in town (a blessing) but is only a 5 minute drive away. One of the great 'extras' is the shuttle service provided to guests who want to dine in town. You can book a shuttle (free to guests) and get dropped off in town and picked up again after dinner.

If you value friendliness, value for money, helpfulness, enthusiasm and really top notch local knowledge then this might be the right place for you. Everything that needs to be said about this place is on these pages - I won't reiterate, but would just note that from my experience, the real key to this place is in the people. Exmouth is not a Maldivian island resort. Its true beauty is something you discover if you take the time and look. And you need to be prepared to do lots of things to really just begin to get a feel for it. We swam with a whale shark, took a boat trip through Yardie Creek, snorkelled amazing coral from the beach, took a flight over the park and the reef, went on a glass bottom boat tour, drove through (a bit of) the Cape Range National Park, had fabulous shell finding beach walks (but put them back!), drove carefully past monitor lizards, buzzards, emus and millions of kangaroos, watched the sunset from the lighthouse, ate in just about every different place in Exmouth at least once (most ok - none excellent) and barbequed fresh fish from Kailis (that was excellent). The thing about the people at the Sea Breeze is that they know how to make all of this work around you. They know how to maximise the quality of your experience, and they also stop you from getting ripped off or making mistakes. They want to talk to you about what you want, and they honestly can help you get more out of whatever you want to do or see. From the time before I booked, right up to the moment they dropped us back at the airport, they bent over backwards to help me organise an intricate weeks activity for my family/wife's 40th. I trusted their advice on many many things - and I'm so glad because everything turned out as they said.", "title": "Unpretentious", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Man_with_clan", "date": "July 10, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115212338}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I could only afford the luxury of the Novatel for one evening meal.
