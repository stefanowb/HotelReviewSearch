All of the \"downtown\" hotels and B&B's seemed overpriced to me so I broadened my search a bit geographically since we had a car and came upon the Capanille which appeared to be on the edge of town and a motel type facility with the right price. As we approached town from the direction of St. Lo, we found it literally on the roundabout and what appeared to be its own exit (actually it was a minor street which passed by the hotel). We checked in and were pleased to be in a very acceptable, clean facility with plenty of room and comfortable beds. Our view from our room was across a verdant pasture with our own four dairy cows beyond the hedge and a great view of the Bayeux Cathedral. We set out to find the tour pickup point for the following morning and discovered that from our roundabout, it was about 300-400 yards to the next roundabout and we were on the street which passed the cathedral , the main tourist facilities, two blocks from the Bayeux Tapestry, the tourist information office, the parking lot, and our tour pickup point (other tours were also picking up at the same spot). I was delighted to find it was so close as I had expected to be a couple of miles out of town. More serious walkers than me might consider the hotel to be in walking distance. The hotel had a restaurant that was certainly competive in quality and price with other places we ate. I was also pleased with the booking procedure which I handled through a company called Activa. I booked 3 nights and found I had made an error on the date. Through the booking website, I easily changed the date. Later we had to adjust our schedule due to problems with the tour we wanted and again a couple of clicks and the adjustment was made with no problem. They accepted major credit cards so no problem with looking for ATM's. Tip: When exiting the second roundabout toward \"centre\" about a block on the right is the entry to a free parking lot which is about 2 blocks from the tapestry and another 2 blocks from the tour pickup. The tour pickup is within a couple of blocks of everywhere in town where a tourist would go.", "title": "Only stay here if you really have too!", "user": "75del", "date": "April 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 102621580}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2011", "text": "The price of the room the same as Premier Inn,but not as good as value,the rooms are small,and in the heat you stand a chance of sufocating,with shutters down and very little air,and the aircon did not work!

At the second roundabout from the hotel, there is a free parking lot behind the Bayeux Tapestry Musuem. From there, you can walk all over town. We also parked in this lot when we went on our all day D-Day Beaches Tour. We ate one night in the restaurant and I would rate the restaurant as only average. We did not find the female receptionist very helpful. She could not point out on the map where the square was where we were to meet for our D-Day Tour nor would she make the local phone call to confirm our tour the following day. She wasn't rude, but I felt she did not want to be bothered.

It didn't have anything extra special that is for sure. Oh, except for crickets. It had a couple of those. Our room backed to a field with cows and frogs, which I thought was quite endearing, but then I used to live in the country. The crickets were only trouble-some at night if you had to get up and go to the bathroom, and when you turned on the light they scurried around. Kinda creepy. I think if the room you end up with is used by a lot of other people, you wouldn't have the cricket problem. Or maybe that is just the result of being next to that field. Anyway, it was ok.
