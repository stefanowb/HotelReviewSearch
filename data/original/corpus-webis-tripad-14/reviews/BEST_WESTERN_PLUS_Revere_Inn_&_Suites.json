Because it sounded nice and was in a good location, I decided to book reservations online. However, after selecting the room and providing payment information, the web page stuck and would not proceed in processing the reservation. Rather, it went to a \"Page Not Found\" instead of a receipt with a confirmation number. After another attempt I became aggrevated and decided to make reservations at my second choice, The Inn at Leola Village (which I most highly recommend). The following month, I noticed a charge on my visa bill for 2 nights' stay at the Best Western in Paradise. I called the hotel and spoke with, hands down, the nastiness customer service representative on earth, who told me that I had reserved a room for 2 nights and was a \"no show,\" so I was charged. I tried over and over to explain to her that I did attempt to make a reservation but that it would not go through and I never received any confirmation, but this horrible woman only became more and more aggressive, finally telling me she \"didn't really care,\" that it wasn't her fault, and that I would pay for that room because I reserved it and did not show up.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "IRISHhms", "date": "May 19, 2011", "id": 108918256}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I subsequently wrote to the manager of the hotel and also to the Best Western corporate office (this was a longshot since Best Westerns are privately owned and operated, but I thought they should at least know the low level of customer service being provided at this particular namesake).

We asked for and received a handicap room. At the time of booking I had called to ask if there was a microwave in the room and I was told that there would be one there. Upon arrival there was no microwave. One was brought to us by the maintenance staff that discovered there was no available outlet to plug it into and off they went to locate an extension cord. We went out for dinner and requested that they wait until we returned to install the microwave with the extension cord. When we returned we received an extension cord from the front desk with only one receptacle. As the cord should have had two receptacles due to the amount of appliances it had to hold, I contacted the front desk. I was informed that because we had requested no one be in our room while we were out that is why the cord was wrong. The young man at the desk was extremely rude so I asked to speak to the manager. When she came on the line, she too was very rude. She said she didn't understand electrical problems and would have to have someone investigate..........hhhhmmmmm......what was there to understand? Either a new extension cord that could hold two plugs or a longer cord that could run to the next outlet. Then I was told that they didn't put microwaves in the handicap rooms due to the safety issues BUT..........the bathroom counter, where the sink and water were, held an electric coffee pot and was regular height........the \"handicap\" bath was not a shower but a regulation tub that you had to step over.......sure didn't make sense to us.

We stayed at Room 315 which was a room with king size bed and a separate sitting area. The bathroom was spotless. There was a separate vanity/make up area outside of the bathroom with a chair/stool. We were amazed by the size of the room, and the fact that there were two TV's in the room and one could be easily hooked with PlayStation. The wireless worked perfectly. We used both the indoor and outdoor pools. It was late in the afternoon and we were the only two in the outdoor pool. Complimentary breakfast was close to the quality of what being offered in Element, of not better. The breakfast area was small, but trays were offered so we could easily bring the food up to our room to enjoy. Yes, TRAYS! The hotel does put everything in consideration. So many times when I had breakfast buffet at other hotels, I wished trays were offered so that I didn't need to make multiple trips to carry drinks, food, utensils, etc. to the table.
