Hotel d'Avaugour disappointed, as our rooms looked nothing like the pictures on its website. Instead of charming floral prints, our rooms were obviously decorated back in the 70's. However, the bathrooms were nice, as was the breakfast. I was really shocked to find out that the heater in our room didn't work and asked to be moved to another room. We were then told that none of the radiator heaters in the rooms worked. Now, I understand that if one is not staying in a luxury hotel, air conditioning cannot be expected in Europe; however, I can't say I've ever heard of a hotel room without heat! To be fair, the staff did give us a portable heater for one room, and the staff is really what made our stay so pleasant. Both the girls working at reception were really wonderful.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "cmcfong", "date": "September 16, 2004", "id": 2578861}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Warm, friendly atmosphere", "text": "Lovely spot: convenient, charming, beautiful remodeled public areas, bar, drop-dead-gorgeous gardens, and wonderful, charming, sweet staff. Public parking is across the street and you have to remember to run out in the morning and feed the meter. Walking is very convenient into the lovely walled city. Bathroom was large and well--equipped. The room's decor was traditional and not new. I'd suggest that the old desks removed from the hall so it is not so cluttered and that the lights allow the area to remain lit for more than 5 seconds. Otherwise, I loved our stay there.", "user": "beekay458", "date": "June 16, 2010", "id": 67739689}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lovely hotel with excellent staff", "text": "We spent 3 nights here, the rooms overlooked the main square and were well furnished with excellent bathrooms.

First I will say that it is perfectly located in town with good parking across the street. The women at the front desk were most helpful (I needed a doctor's visit) and polite with perfect English (much needed in this case) The garden out back where we had breakfast every morning was very nice and made for lovely photos. However, I defy anyone to come up with rooms that are as charming as the lovely room on their website with the red checked bedspread, flowers and tea. I looked in no less than 10 rooms on 2 floors while the maids were cleaning. They are all plain ordinary rooms, which would be just fine if I hadn't been lead to believe the rooms would have a modicum of charm. So go on the website and find the plainest looking room and know that that will be what your will look like and you won't be disappointed. Also, be sure to book a garden view room and not a street view.", "user": "goodtrips01", "date": "September 20, 2009", "id": 43054057}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A triumph of charm and service in the traditional style", "text": "Have you ever read a Hemingway novel and noticed that the type of hotel mentioned within the pages seems so vastly different from what one experiences now?
