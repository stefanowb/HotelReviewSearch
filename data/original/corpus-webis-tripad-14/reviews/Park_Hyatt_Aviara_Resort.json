They don't assign rooms until check-in, and after reading about both villa locations - the summit and the meadows - I was still undecided about which was best. As it turned out, we got to try both. The first night we were given a room at the Summit location... closer to the main hotel. The room was great, 1300 sq. feet with a full kitchen, laundry room, and two bathrooms. The location wasn't terrific though... a first floor room overlooking (distantly) a fairly busy road. We asked the front desk if it were possible to move to a room on a higher floor. The staff were great and arranged for us to move the next day to a room at The Meadows. They assured us the view would be much better and they were right... the view was fantastic!

Think large, wide hallways but no chairs. It's an odd property: all the guest rooms are on one side grouped around the pools, while the other half of the very large property is comprised of banquet/conference spaces. Only one venue for dinner (formal), and a very limited bar menu for informal dining. A nice gym open 24 hrs, but pool closes at 9pm. The landscaping is odd -- shrubs and trees are so high they block the view. Why are they blocking the view of the golf course and the valley? All in all, I just didn't get this property. I did appreciate how clean everything was, how large the guest rooms were, the pleasant fragrance pumped in to the hallways, the private patio, the quiet grounds. As others have commented, daily rates are considerably higher than rack rates due to mandatory resort fee and parking; why don't hoteliers just make these part of the basic rate? This is the only property -- from the highes to lowest end where I've stayed -- that hasn't provided an in-room coffee maker (room service coffee is $9-12 per pot plus tax, gratuity and service fee), and unlike other Hyatts, there is no lobby coffee service. One would have to travel to the other side of the property to get coffee from the restaurant (and not sure they'd make it \"to go\" back to the room). I'm not a coffee drinker but I know this would be very annoying to anyone who is used to a morning cup on awakening. On the other hand, this is also the only property I've been to recently that has offered a shower cap in the room (can't figure out why they stopped providing such an inexpensive but appreciated item).

Altogether a pleasant experience, although one senses a slight notch down from what one imagines this property must have been under Four Seasons management. Door and valet staff were friendly and accomodating ($30 overnight valet charge); car was always brought up promptly. Lobby simple, elegant and dramatic. The pumped in odor was a bit much (like a nice tune played loud, what for?). Check in was prompt and courteous. Staff gave us general layout of the main floor and walked us to the elevators, which were a bit around the bend (this building has a very large footprint so get ready for long walks to hotel dining). Our room (panorama room) was simply appointed, clean and comfortable (comfortable sheets). Large closet, electronic vault of good size, oversized couch, functional desk and comfortable bed (a bit on the soft side). Flat screen TV was larger than necessary. Bathroom supersized and good amenities. Nice strong enclosed shower (separate from the tub). Towels were unimpressive. Maid and turn down service was good (towels replaced and ice bucket filled at turn down), although room was not first serviced until 4 pm two of our days (annoying). Very comfortable chairs on balcony overlooking lagoon and hills, with a bit of the hazy ocean in distant sight. Breakfast was included in my rate package, and the buffet was an invitation for gluttony. Quality stuff. Omelettes made to order. Very pleasant wait staff. I alternated taking breakfast inside and on the balcony, which had views of the golf course and housing subdivisions. Had dinner twice at Vivace, which had some interesting entrees and appetizers. I would rate Vivace very good, but not exceptional. Ate at California Bistro for one dinner, which was just fine. The atomosphere of the restaurants and the hotel's common areas is casual, with a mix of those in suits, business casual and shorts. Plenty of common area in which one can sit and relax. Nice bar off the main lobby. Wi-Fi \"included\" in the daily resort fee. Checked out but did not use the exercise room (looked clean and had a good variety of exercise equipment). We did not take advantage of any spa services, so cannot offer an opinion there. The family pool looked nice enough (certainly large), but we spent most of our time at the tranquility pool, which was quiet and pleasant. Very comfortable lounge chairs. Umbrellas if you wish shade. Water temperature just right. One can order a very nice lunch and drinks from 11 am until 3 or so (later for drinks). While the staff were attentive, the pool area was short on maintenance. Where someone dropped food (in an obvious place) or left a pile of ud towels on a lounge chair after leaving, it was far too long before these were cleaned up. At a hotel of this quality, staff should be all over this sort of thing pronto. We took advantage of the \"beach butler.\" Very friendly and accommodating driver took us by van to Moonlight Beach in Encinitas, a few miles away, and picked us up three hours later. We were set up with chairs, umbrella, towlels and bottled water. Possible to order food to be brought along. The beach experience was pleasant, but not the luxury experience the hotel's pictures suggest. The beach itself was only fair, as construction was going on (not the hotel's fault of course, but wondered if there was a better beach nearby). Beach chairs that the hotel brought along seemed to come from someon's garage sale - they worked, but not appropriate for this sort of hotel. Easy to enter the water, and shallow enough for kids to play safely. Water's edge was good for a long stroll or jog along the cliffs off the main part of the beach. Pleasant mix of boarders, young families and older folks lounging. Back to the hotel: like other reviewers, I believe this hotel offers good value for a luxury resort and I would definitely return.

The accommodations, grounds and exceptional service were all top notch. This resort is located on a hilltop overlooking a beautiful golfcourse and a lagoon which has been restored to a wildlife habitat. The gounds are loaded with wonderful art and landscaping. The lobby and rooms are understated and elegant. Our room was on a corner with a balcony affording fabulous views. The area was not as remote as I expected from the literature. The resort is actually in a more urban setting in a residential neighborhood with several major thoroughfares within view from the room. There are plenty of places to visit in the immediate area, including La Jolla, San Diego, Del Mar, Oceanside, the desert, and more. The Quail Botanical Gardens in Carlsbad are a must for lovely trails filled with plants and trees. The only surpise we had was the enormous number of families with small children. This was actually undertandable with the proximity to Legoland and the Wild Animal Park and the fact it was a holiday, but I was still surprised and it may not have been the best choice to celebrate an anniversary. It was virtually impossible to enjoy a quiet drink in the bar when so many children were actually eating dinner in the bar. And the fine restaurant was a lot more family oriented and casual than anticipated. It was not the best venue for an anniversary dinner. Add to that that they seated us at a sofa at a table in the dead center of the room, and they knew this was an anniversary dinner. We thought that was an odd choice, but I am sure they would have moved us had we asked. There are plenty of highly rated restaurants in the vicinity, so dining off property is an option.
