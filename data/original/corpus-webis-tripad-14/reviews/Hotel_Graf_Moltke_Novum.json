This drops you off in front of the station and costs 8 euros return. It is quick and efficient. Similarly, the U bahn metro system outside the station can take you quickly and cheaply to all the tourist sites. The hotel itself is clean throughout, the reception staff were all very pleasant and the room we stayed in was adequate for our three night stay. We booked a larger type room (though it wasn't that large!) and this looked out onto an inner courtyard, so not much of a view but at least it was quiet. We did not go down for our breakfast as we were out quite late each night so cannot comment on this. (We walked into town and had a good brunch in the Karstad department store restaurant for a few euros).", "title": "Adequate hotel for short stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "hesketh27", "date": "January 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 13124005, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly, smiling, efficient staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Room could have been bigger"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled solo", "text": "All in all, however,we felt the room was overpriced at 110 euros per night. The area around the hotel is a red light district and apart from the working girls, there were some shady characters hanging about. Visitors need to be aware of this before considering any hotel in this vicinity. Do not let this put you off however. At no time did we feel threatened and we were often just coming in at 3.30 a.m. If you are looking for a clean, no frills hotel with a good location then you could do a lot worse than stay here, especially if you can get a cheaper deal than we did. It is an especially good location if you want to visit the St. Georg gay scene.
