I walked over to the employee at the entrance of the restaurant and told her I was supposed to talk to her about their limited menu options. She said yes, it was going to be just the cold items on the appetizer menu available. And most likely only 3 dinner entre choices.. Fish and beef and probably something vegetarian. I thought that was odd and wondered in their busiest summer month, why would they have such a limited menu. I told her I'd think about it. We decided to keep the reservation. When I asked our waiter if everything on the menu was available.. He said Yes? Like he thought I was crazy for even asking. What's up with that?

I'm don't know if we'd go back mostly because of the price. We camp for a reason, it's cheap! :) I've also read from others that internet was not provided. This is true, they do have a \"pay\" option but not worth the price.
