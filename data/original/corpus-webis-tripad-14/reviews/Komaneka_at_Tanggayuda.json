Komaneka Monkey Forest is the original resort. It is located off Monkey Forest Road which is the main road running through downtown area of Ubud. Therefore most of the shops and restaurants you will want to see are all in walking distance, including actual Monkey Forest. On the other hand Tanggayuda was opened about two years ago and is located about 15 minutes from central Ubud. It might seem far, but the hotel offers a free shuttle service that runs every hour between Tangayuda and Central Ubud, a nice drive past rice paddies and roadside shops. They will drop you off wherever you want and pick up as well. It also means that at Tanggayuda you stay away from the more crowded downtown near the Ayung River Valley where there are beautiful hikes and whitewater rafting. In fact, some of the other fanciest hotels (Four Seasons and Amandari) are off the same road as Komaneka Tanggayuda.
