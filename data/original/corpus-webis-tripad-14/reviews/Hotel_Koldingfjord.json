Now it has changed hands a couple years ago and its accent is on business/ conference public. Prices have gone up moderately, but the original interesting summer deals have gone. This year (in July) we found out a summer price of DK 1195 for a family of four (kids 6 and 9). Normal price DK 2390 and weekends DK 1895. Quite a price, but you get a lot: the room of our choice is either 505 or 502 in Dagmar Palae (sep. building in the courtyard). Wonderful large room, ample place, two large double beds, B&O TV; room service; just what we need, after a long day car travel (9 hrs.). Most staff has changed, but still professional, friendly, but distant. You don't get the welcoming feeling of the (reception) staff as it used to be. The inside swimming pool is ok for kids who can swin, but the bathrobes in the rooms and the towels at the pool are no longer there. The Lego toy and play corner, suitable for kids, has also vanished. The restaurant and breakfastbuffet is still very ok! Its location is excellent with wonderful views and (short) walks along the fjord. We tried on our way back from Norway another night, but prices had gone up with 700 DK, due to the end of the Summer offer. This offer parallels the Danish Schoolholidays (!?!), which end four weeks earlier than in our home and some other Europ. countries. The receptionist was strict and by the book. Basically I understand that, but no manager available or prepared to backup requests. The returning client was no issue and the formal and distant way I was attended made me back out decently. So we will let our next stop depend on the price than listed. But still, it is a remarkable and recommendable hotel for an enjoyable stay.

We got our rooms in the annex to the main building, which was also rustic and cozy. The rooms are big and done in a monochrome of whites that feel very soothing. There are big windows allowing ample of natural day light. There were Bang and Olufsen TV and Arne Jacobsen lampshades that spoke of good taste and quality of the interiors. The beds were comfortable and bathrooms were big and clean, supplied with hairdryer and organic toiletries. We were told that the hotel has a swimming pool, sauna and steam that we unfortunately did not get to use due to time crunch. The proximity of the hotel to the fjord and the forrest makes it an ideal place for runners and at the same time for relaxation. There is a boat docking area right in front of the hotel, owned by the hotel, where private boats can be moored.
