For Brisbane, that was probably the cheapest you'll pay anywhere.The car park is secure and a fast lift takes you straight up to your room.

The setting of the Hotel is lovely,however the resturant was a great dissapointment. The food is pub/club style but the prices match some of the better Brisbane restaurants. When our coffee was served it arrived luke-warm (we don't live in Italy). We were told they were having trouble with the expresso machine so we asked for another that was just a little better. The real upset was the bill. I always make a point of checking resturants bills. I could see straight away there was lot of food and drink charges that were not ours. When I asked to see the supervisor I was told the bills were hard to read, but the bill was correct!!! We were a table of 4 and charged for 6 meals and many drinks and other additions that we did not order. There was a $70 mistake. I asked for a new bill but apparently that was impossible because it would entail crediting and re-entering the data, and it was all too much trouble. The Supervisor attended the table and said the meals and drinks had been deducted from the bill. I was so upset I am still not sure it we paid the right amount.
