Valeria went above and beyond to help us out and make us feel welcome. Right from the start, she was fantastic at keeping in touch via e-mail, answering all of our questions and confirming dates. She also arranged for a car to pick us up from the airport at 1:00 am when our flight arrived. Yes, we were greeted and shown to our room at 1:30 am when we finally arrived at the house. It was a horrible flight and there could not have been a better way to end it.

The AC unit really cools the room down well, which is a lifesaver in February. The room is also adorned with Jorge's paintings, as is the entire house. If you can spare the extra charge, I would recommend getting the family suite, simply for the amount of space you get and how comfortable the entire layout is.
