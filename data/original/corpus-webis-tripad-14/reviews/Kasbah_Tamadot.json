I have been lucky enough to stay some lovely suites over the years and this would definitely be one of the poorest for the price. This would be more tolerable on a city break when you tend to be in the room for the bare minimum of time, on a retreat holiday you spend a lot more time in your suite.

It is a sophisticated and beautifully landscaped castellated property set in the Asni area overlooking a valley to a neighbouring Berber village. Although the superior rooms we requested to see at the end of our visit were delightful, we were actually upgraded on arrival to a Berber tent with its own patio and jaccuzi; this tent was spacious and sumptously equipped if slightly draughty. In addition to the heating system, there were already 2 free-standing heaters available which were used throughout our stay as the weather was indeed chilly even during sunny periods! There was an electrical failure (during heavy rain) to the tent which was duly rectified; the wi-fi conection in the tent area was flakey and actually packed in irredeemably on the last of our 4 nights.The staff were phenominal in that they were mostly local Berbers who acquitted themselves in every task with the greatest perfection and courtesy; this is a tribute to the training provided by the Kasbah and the high standard of staff and material management. Because of the isolated position, the only practical dining option is to enjoy the Kasbah's beautiful dining room, its excellent food and meticulous service. The dining, lounge and library areas were warmed by well tended open olive wood fires. Outdoor activities are speedily arranged via the desk; our trek took us to a Berber village and some stunning views on the way. Adjacent to the landscaped gardens, there is an animal enclosure with camels, goats etc which are all beautifully tended. There is a small Berber shop attached to the perimeter wall of the property; it is clear that the Kasbah has also served the local community very well.

The building and grounds are really beautiful and tranquil, and the views are wonderful across the valley. We had a 3 course lunch plus amuse bouche (which we were served twice, my husband tried to explain in English that we'd already eaten it once, but the waitress didn't understand until I explained in French)! The food was lovely but for the price we expected a lot better. The staff were friendly and attentive, always making sure our drinks were topped up and suggesting cocktails, and then calling our taxi for us when we had finished.
