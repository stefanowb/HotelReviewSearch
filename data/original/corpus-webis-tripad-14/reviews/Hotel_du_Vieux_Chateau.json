When we arrived it was mid-afternoon and we couldn't check in until 5, the room that we were eventually given was by no means a 'superieur' room that we had paid for. We asked to be moved as we looked out the back of the hotel onto a wall and we had paid for a room with a view and all we got was a small room at the back with bars on the window. The manager was incredibly rude, quickly turning agressive. He doesn't seem to want to run a hotel - just a restaurant. The next morning the breakfast was passable, even if the service was terrible - we waited 15 mins for orange juice. However the next morning before we checked out we were denied even this. Apparently if you want breakfast you have to have dinner at the hotel the night before! There were non-hotel guests eating breakfast but we were not served. We paid our over-priced bill and left. It seems that if you don't complain and do what they tell you and sit where they tell you then they are reasonably nice but the moment you make any requests (as is your right in a hotel) they are incredibly rude and agressive and told us if we don't like it then go somewhere else and our room will be filled almost immediately!

We were on the top floor with a tiny window with a view of the town square below and just above the lake. Another bit of advice, if you are a light sleeper, be forewarned that the town clock goes off ALL night.

Instead walk 25 ft to Autour de la Table and buy their wonderful chevre frais and then pop up the stairs to the boulangerie just down the street and buy a lovely fresh baguette. The first night we had the set dinner, it was fine, but you are limited in your choices obviously. Second evening we ate at the restaurant just around the bend - Altitude 823 (Aiguine's altitude). We had the local meat stew called Daube. Described here by Wikipedia: \"Daube proven\u00e7ale is a stew made with cubed beef braised in wine, vegetables, garlic, and herbes de provence. Variations also call for olives, prunes, and flavoring with duck fat, vinegar, brandy, lavender, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, juniper berries, or orange peel.\" It was so good, that the next night we ate back at the Chateau and asked for a la carte and had their version of Daube - wonderful!.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 8, 2005", "id": 2989808}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Mostly positives. Despite some concerns based on experiences described in other reviews, we were treated with courtesy and friendliness at every turn. The setting of the hotel is great: you are directly on the small village square overlooking the fountain and the hotel's outdoor cafe tables. The church also faces the same square and it does have bells that ring in the usual French way, but they seemed to stop about 9 or 10 PM. Free parking was readily available on the street a very short walk away and the car could pull up to the hotel's main doors for luggage loading and unloading. We did demi-pension and found our dinners to be be very good. The breakfasts were modest but nothing tasted to us like it came from the supermarket. Quite the contrary. Drawbacks: for most rooms, you will have to navigate some steep stairs. If you get a view room (we did), the view is very pretty Lake St. Croix in the distance, the local chateau and the town square nearer), but the distant view is only over the top of an adjacent building that blocks most of the view, and the window is configured such that you kind of have to squat down and lean forward through the window to really benefit from the view. The room was reasonably good-sized and the bathroom bigger than normal, although the room was modest and a little worn, but entirely consistent with the hotel's two-star rating.

We called ahead from Moustiers to ask about a room for the night. We were told in reassuring tones that they had availability. The arrangement was that we would come over and have a look. No indication was given that we might need to hurry or reserve. When we arrived, the manager, who had taken the call, listened to us and then walked slowly over to the bar, where he proceeded to turn pages in a large book. As the pages moved, so his head began to move, shaking from side to side. He returned to tell us the there was nothing available, without a hint of regret. When we reminded him that we had called, he told us in a clipped, schoolmasterly tone that we had called sometime ago, and stood staring at us. Was it smugness or indifference that held his face so tight? Although it was clear that we were now without anywhere to stay at 8pm, our new friend did not condescend to offer any advice as to alternative places, but confined himself to a perfunctory 'desol\u00e9e' and let us wander out into the night.
