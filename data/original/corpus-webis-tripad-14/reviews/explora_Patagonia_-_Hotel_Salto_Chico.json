Lunch was always very good and when we headed out for full-day treks, our lunch was packed for us and our guides carried hot soup and freshly-baked dessert for us (as a surprise). If we were doing half days, there were always health snacks available. Between lunch and dinner, appetizers are served while we pick out what we want to do the next day.
