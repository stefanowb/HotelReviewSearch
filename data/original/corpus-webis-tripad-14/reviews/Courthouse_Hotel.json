For the first few hours of my first night's stay i was without internet until a pleasant employee - Bilal kindly came up to the room and assisted. For the final night of my stay, there was NO wifi whatsoever. My complaints were met with responses that the hotel has been having problems with their service provider for a while.

Every Saturday they show a film (old / new / black&white). The hotel used to be a court hence the name and has retained some of it's original features which was cool. The bar was sophisticated and had kept the old prison cells and made them into seating areas. Staff were conscientious and polite.

The Courthouse is aptly named as it used to be one, and therefore the property sports some interesting features, not the least of which is the ground floor bar where one can reserve booths in the old prison cells. Definitely worth a beverage and photograph! The decor is very welcoming, and the large downstairs open lounge is perfect when you want to relax and use the free Wi-Fi. We reserved a table on the rooftop terrace. In sunny or crisp weather it's the perfect way to wind down, but definitely reserve if you want to experience it - the London business folk are in the know and they tend to make their way up there after work. The mojitos and twist on the Long Island Iced Tea are delicious - I speak from personal experience. Our room was a twin - a good size with a nicely designed bathroom, complete with bidet and large tub. When you first sit on the beds you might find them firmer than you're used to, but I'm here to tell you that they are all kinds of comfortable. Both of us had a great night's sleep. The only thing that we might have liked would have been a wider selection of TV channels. I'm sure people think \"Why would you want to watch TV when you're in one of the most vibrant cities in the world?\" When you finally get back to your room, you want to watch something other than the news - there are limited choices. There are pay movies, but there were many more free channels available when we visited smaller town hotels outside of London. The drink service in both bars was also a little slower than we would have preferred. It could be that they need more staff on when it's busy, or that the fancy drinks require longer to prepare. Both of these comments are minor points and certainly did not lessen the enjoyment of our stay there. A shout out to Zoltan at Concierge who went completely out of his way to look after us. This hotel is SO well located! Visit the shops, bars and restaurants of Soho - so close that you could do it in stilettos and not worry about your feet killing you at the end of the night. You can also wander up and down Regent Street, or turn the corner to Oxford Street to shop, shop, shop!
