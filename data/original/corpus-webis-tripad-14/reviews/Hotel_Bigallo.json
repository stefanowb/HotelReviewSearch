NO NEED for concern. The hotel was expecting us; the desk clerk was helpful in guiding us in getting our luggage up the one interior stairway we had to nagivate; and the room was charming. There was a roomy loft comfortably sleeping two, and my bed was downstairs - a perfectly comfortable daybed. One desk clerk, the one who was there as we arrived, was especially charming and helpful. She was most complimentary of my poor but earnest Italian language skills.

We could hear the noise even when the windows were closed at night....people were out until 1am or longer.

She told us that the hotel was closed and that she would take us to another property nearby (a much worst one). We were so puzzled, and disappointed.

I myself would have enjoyed a palace or two to look at rather than the paintings. breakfast more like your continental breakfast in the states bread and coffee items not much. every thing is new and clean and the bathroom has a tub and shower. I cannot say enough about the room it had a loft to the bed room area so romantic and the view breathtaking!! the staff wasn't rude just not as helpful as the four and five star hotels that we had been to but for sure not rude!! we stayed in 1404 awsome view with air", "title": "Great location, poor service", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "RedCharleston", "date": "September 22, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 2592559}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "GREAT VIEWS FROM ROOM", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the Bigallo 9-15-04 to 9-20-04, and found it to be wonderful.
