For a pre-birthday afternoon tea. Me and my partner arrived a little early for our booking but the staff were amazing and managed to squeeze us in, the lounges were tastefully but classically yet modernly decorated with comfortable seating. The temperature was lovely and cool inside on such a warm day outside but it was very comfortable, not chilly at all! The quality of the furnishings and the crockery and cutlery was outstanding and the food was mind blowing, the sweet desert and cake selection was outstanding, there was carrot cake, chocolate cake, poppy and lemon cake, cherry cake, Victoria sandwich cake plus more, The chocolate parkin type fridge biscuit was delicious and I'm sure i could taste a little tipple of rum in it, i wish I'd asked for a doggy bag, there was various tea types and coffee types on offer and afternoon tea could be eaten in the garden on the nice day it was or in either of the two spacious lounges, the sandwiches were so lovely with an array of fillings on white and wholemeal bread both vegi and meat option, and the savouries and apple and pork pie were to die for, the buffet style afternoon tea was the best idea afternoon tea has been served at as it meant you were not restricted to what you could have and how much you could have, you were asked if you needed any top ups or re-fills of teas and were allowed even to change your tea during your meal. You were encouraged to go back to the buffet tables for more food as you wished and it was not something to feel embarrassed about just topping up plate after plate! The chocolate mouse was delicious and so light the meringue nests were pink my favorite colour and had fresh bream and strawberries on them they were crunchy on the outside but still chewy on the inside perfection its self! There was cream butter and various jams and lemon curd with the scones of which there was a choice of Fruit or plain and these could be heated if required by the staff. I have to say the staff were wonderful, so attentive but not the type where you felt bothered every moment. The young man serving the tea and coffee was such a pleasure to be served by, and was available when needed even though the garden was busy outside too. All in all this day was wonderful and i will definatly be making this a birthday tradition to go to Rothay for Afternoon tea. and the price is a bargain compared to other local places who charge more and offer less! This is the best afternoon tea i have had by miles, just want more of that pie YUM YUM!!!!!!
