Wonderful all-you-can eat breakfast for 3.70 euros with fresh rolls, cheese, salami, ham, cereal, tomatoes, cucumbers, fresh fruit, yogurt, bread for toast, jam, butter, waffle mix, orange juice, tea and the most wonderful coffee machine that dispenses about ten different kinds of drinks, including wonderful cappuccino and hot chocolate.

Your room card (key) was also the key to the lockers so you only had to keep up with one item which was brilliant! The bar was a very lively spot to talk with and meet other travellers.
