Do pay the extra price to obtain a room on the first floor (there are only four), it makes all the difference. Unique situation, very quiet, romantic setting for dinner, very friendly and helpful staff. Avoid July and August when the noisy kids disturb the peace and quiet of the place until midnight. Lovely 9-hole golf course only a few miles away. Nice pool and tennis court. Business men will find excellent laptop facilities.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "blacklab", "date": "October 22, 2006", "id": 5982581}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My girlfriend and I have just returned from a 6 day stay at the Hotel Llenaire and it is a hidden gem - although I guess with this piece it won't be for much longer!", "title": "A real gem...", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "jwoll", "date": "August 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5716484, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The service and location", "disliked": "\u2014 Leaving it"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Situated on a hill about two minutes drive outside of Puerto Pollensa and around 5-6 minutes from Pollensa - this beautiful country house has been in the same family for around 100 years and they restored it to its former glory just four years ago, and it is now a 12 or 13 room hotel", "title": "adored llenaire", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "rugby06ireland", "date": "July 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5418911}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 6, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 35}, "aka": "Llenaire Hotel Pollenca", "slim_ranking": 0.1}
