Marriott recently changed to a points system, so maybe that's why we got a 2 bedroom/2 bath condo when we only own a one bedroom through Club Navigo (Island One). We enjoyed the upgrade! We read all the mixed reviews. When we arrived we asked for an ocean view room, but not in the Kingfisher building as suggested in a Trip Advisor review. The clerk was shocked that there were any negative things, but said the Marriott guests that are owners actually REQUEST the Kingfisher building! She said she could give us an ocean view upgrade: We could see the Atlantic from our room AND the inlet to the intercostal/ lagoon waterways and see all the boats going by. We fell in love with the view. The rooms are very spacious. It IS due for a remodel/update, but the aesthetics were not a deal breaker. This building looks different from the other 3 and is set apart by a large private pink condo/apartment building. So, if you have small kids you DON\"T want to stay there as there is a lot of walking to get to the activities held at the other pools and buildings. We actually LIKED that is was farther away and enjoyed the exercise. The resort is very fitness oriented as they offer daily stretching classes and water aerobics. I tried the water aerobics for the first time and Loved it! Zumba is twice a week. I tried this for the first time, too and loved it. When rain cancels an outdoor activity it's usually relocated or changed to an indoor building. I loved the changing beach on my twice daily walks. Plenty of shells for those that like that. I collect sea glass and brought home a lot of pieces. There are a lot of onsite activities that are free or low cost like games, crafts and video games. they have Wii, X-Box and Atari!

The points cost was very good value. We were in the Kingfish building which is remote from the reception and main activity area, however on the plus side it was never too crowded around our pool area. The room had a partial sea view and was up to \"Marriot\" standard, that is in my opinion very good, well appointed and very clean. If you wanted to use the beach then you either took your own chairs and parasol or you could rent those placed on the beach by a local company. we prefer the pool side anyway as a rule so not a problem. The on site market stocked the basics, the nearest 7 - 11 was about a half mile walk up the road as was a couple of very \"lively\" bar/ restaurants. There is a Publix just over the bridge to do a serious food shop. In order to find a decent restaurant you had to get in the car and drive off Singer island and look around the shopping areas. The huge and diverse Garden Mall is just a few miles away, there is also a good selection of shops and eateries at the Oakbrook shopping area.

We have stayed at Marriott timeshares in Orlando, Phoenix, and Aruba, and this one was by far our favorite. The resort is clean and well-kept, and the pools, kids' area, bar, bathrooms, Marketplace, etc. are all centrally located, and very convenient no matter which building you are staying in. The parking is free, which was an added bonus. Beware if you are a smoker. The resort is smoke-free, so you are not even permitted to smoke on your balcony. There are a few designated smoking areas, but that's it. We could not get enough of the beach here. The water is crystal clear, and we had a great time bobbing in the waves. The resort is the last one on the strip, so it doesn't get as much foot traffic as I imagine the resorts further down do, which makes it really enjoyable, and not overly crowded. If you don't have chairs of your own, you will need to pay to rent lounge chairs and an umbrella (shade is a must on this beach or you will roast). We paid $100 for the week, and it was the best investment we made. The chairs are adjustable, our spot was right near the water, and the guys that run the service come around a few tmes a day to see if you need your umbrella moved to provide more shade. They are highly attentive, and also a great source of info for recommendations for places to eat, and things to do in the area. We were even lucky enough to see a giant sea turtle laying her eggs on the beach one night when we went for a moon-lit walk! I really can't say enough about this resort. It is just spectacular. And if you have children, it's a great spot. They have a kiddie pool, a sprinkler park, and a whole area of games...minigolf, shuffleboard, bocce, corn hole, etc. And the resort offers a variety of daily activites for kids and families. You can even rent boogie boards and bikes right there at the resort.
