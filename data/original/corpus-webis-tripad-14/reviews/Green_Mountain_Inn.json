We would highly recommend the hotel. Only downside was the somewhat spotty housekeeping service; came a little late and could have been more generous with soaps and refills. Having stayed in an annex room also experienced some noise from guests who were using the pool; good thing it closes at 9 at night. Overall excellent and will gladly return.", "title": "Once Again Excellent", "user": "awaywegoFlorida", "date": "December 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 51938863}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Stowe"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 22, "average": 66, "very good": 247, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 699}, "aka": "Green Mountain Hotel Stowe", "slim_ranking": 0.0434782608696, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "A beautifully restored historic inn blending classic country charm and modern amenities in the heart of Stowe village.
