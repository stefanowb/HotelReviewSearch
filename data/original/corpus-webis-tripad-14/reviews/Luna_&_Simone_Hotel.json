I loved when they gave me more OJ for breakfast.

There's a great supermarket halfway to Victoria, which, incidentally, is not the closest Tube station - Pimlico is two blocks away. Also, the #24 bus stops in both directions right outside the hotel.

We weren't disappointed. For a \"budget\" hotel, they do a great job. (80 pounds a night for a double with the current exchange rates may not seem like a budget hotel, but anything under 100 pounds is a budget hotel.) We requested a first floor room for my father-in-law and they came through. We were in room 14 up a few flights of stairs, but we knew this ahead of time and were prepared for it. They do a great job keeping the place clean and the showers/bathrooms were a cut above what you normally find in comparably priced accomodations. The beds were comfortable. Rooms were small, but we weren't there to spread out. Breakfasts were good and the menu was flexible. Free internet was great, but there was usually a queue. Luna Simone is convenient to Victoria Station, which made getting around rather easy. There are also a lot of restaurants within a few blocks. After a long day traipsing around London, it was nice to have dinner nearby. Our room faced Belgrave Road and it could be a bit noisy at times. The first floor room was in the back and was very quiet.
