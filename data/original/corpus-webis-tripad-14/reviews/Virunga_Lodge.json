The banda (individual cabins) are beautiful, big, clean, private, quiet and nicely designed. The service is impeccable, everyone is polite and helpful. The views of the lakes, valley, and volcanoes is spectacular. Sipping a glass of chilled white wine on the terrace admiring the view is a a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon after gorilla trekking. The lodge is an expensive stay but it's so good it still seems value for money. The only possible downside compared to other lodges in the area is that it is a 45 minute drive from the lodge to the gorilla trekking ranger station where you start your day of trekking, meaning a 5am wake-up call and 6am departure from the lodge. I would guess that the other lodges and hotels are closer.
