Unfortunately the receptionists are ice cold, they seem they could not care less and you get the impressions you may be bothering them. When you finally get to go up to your room, you arrive into an incredible heat in the corridors. It is like the subway in Paris. The room surprisingly small, although we had reserved a superior room with balcony and view over the city. Upon inquiry, the receptionst coldly explained that they took the liberty to downgrade our reservation, for we opted for a double room. And they do not have double superior rooms, or so he says. The room itself was not to tidy, cracks on the walls, dirt stains, etc. The thing advertised as swimming pool on the roof is hardlw one. It is rather a bath for birds. The expensive breakfast has nothing to do with the quality expected from a 4 star establishment, very boring, but at least the staff here is very friendly.", "title": "could be a lot better", "user": "lacika34", "date": "November 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 6157736}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great hotel!", "text": "The pros: the location: not in the immediate center, so it is rather calm.
