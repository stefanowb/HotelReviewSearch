I called and reserved a room ahead of time and the lady that worked there help me get the best price. When we showed up I was very impressed with the front lobby and how elegant/clean it was. After a quick check in from the friendly lady at the front, we went to our room. When we walked in it felt like we were the first ones there. It was EXTREMELY clean. The room was very modern in style and both beds had padding that could be adjusted from soft to hard for each side which was awesome. The bathroom was VERY clean and all the products (lotion, shampoo, etc) was Neutrogena. The hotel is very close to all downtown fun so after going out for my birthday we came back and went swimming in the pool that is open 24 hours. DID I MENTION 24 HOURS?? And when we were heading out the next day I found a little mouthwash bottle too which was perfect. The only complaint was that the bathroom didn't have a ceiling fan...that was it. I don't know how people can complain. Unless you live in a castle with servants and gold toilets, this hotel is plenty good for the price. I used to live in Oshkosh but will stay here for any events.

Initially everything was okay, my first morning there I brewed a pot of coffee in my room, had a couple cups and went on my way. Upon returning that evening I went to set up the coffee pot for the next morning, picked up a coffee cup only to find it already used! There were coffee stains on the bottom of the cup, presumably from where I had used it that morning (my cup???). I took the cup down to the front desk and showed the counter person on duty who found me a clean cup as a replacement. To make a long story short, I returned to my room that evening (day 2) to find the coffee area cleaned and my dirty cup, from that morning, again set up as though it was a clean cup. Now I am wondering what else isn't clean in this room and building? My impression was that the staff really have an issue with caring and are riding on the Hilton name which is going the way of gold finishes on 1980 fixtures. Slow drains, low water pressure, noisy AC, poor windows and iffy elevators complete this 'gem' of a bygone era, that should be left there.

The rooms are okay but the carpet is worn and the hotel is not as clean as I would've expected. Overall though, the place is fine. My bigger concern was that I was given a room on the first floor. I just happened to look out of the window (which was partially blocked by large bushes) and noticed that the large sliding window was unlocked (no screen). There were 2 latches on the window and both were unlocked. It would've been very easy for someone to simply slide open the window and enter the room. Given the weather and the location of the room, it was hard to believe that a previous guest inadvertently left the window unlocked. The fact that the large bushes in front of the window would shield an intruder from being seen from the parking lot made it even more suspcious.
