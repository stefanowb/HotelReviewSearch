The staff were courteous and professional, the food was excellent, I had room service most nights. There was free wine in the room every night. I specifically switched to this hotel from my regular \"Templeton\" hotel because of the on site gym. This was well equiped and the staff were very helpful. On the whole the Hotel stay should have been very good indeed. Unfortunately, the whole experience was spoiled for me because the hotel clearly sells itself as a wedding venue. Where I come from weddings are weekend affairs, mostly Saturdays and usually starting mid day. In this hotel they had a wedding reception every evening running until the early hours. Some were more rowdy than others, but one particularly noisy party (a thursday)kept me, and I suspect the whole of the rest of the hotel, awake until 4am. The following saturday I had to travel back to the Midlands (England) by ferry, an 11 hour journey with 8 hours+ driving. I explained my problem to the front desk and they were most apologetic, but could only offer to move me to a room not much further from were I was, with no real advantages noise wise. Thankfully Friday nights' wedding was not so bad and I was able to sleep from about midnight, but I really think that wedding parties and business people who need to be up at 7am each day do not mix well in this hotel.
