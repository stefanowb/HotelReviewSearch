Our last stop was for three nights at Mary's by the Sea and it was such a great way to end our trip!! The house was perfect for the three of us (my husband, me and our 3 year old daughter). We found the bed very comfortable, and loved that we had access to this huge front deck. The place was very clean, well appointed, and the location was so great - you literally are a stone's throw from the beach, and a walk to town was honestly about three minutes. We also enjoyed taking the short drive to Good Harbor beach. Pat and Mary were so nice and helpful - we definitely hope to come back and would highly recommend it to anyone!!", "title": "We will be back!", "user": "shmoukins", "date": "August 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136485567}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 4}, "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Mary's by the Sea offers two 1 bedroom ocean view apartments for short or long term stay.
