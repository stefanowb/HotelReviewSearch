We didn't regret it one bit! Upon arrival, the front desk was a little slower than we would have liked, but we found that this is the pace in the DR. My advice? Take the opportunity during the wait for your room to head to the lounge for a Coco Loco! Or pack your bathing suit in your carry-on so you can wait for your room at the beach. From day one, the service was impeccable, the room we stayed in (328) was spotlessly cleaned every day, and the air conditioning worked almost too well. The buffet restaurants are both great, the food was always fresh and the staff was always friendly and quick with the service. They remembered our names from the first day, and it helps to tip a couple of dollars when the service is great...they remember those who treat them well. Specifically look for Alli (Eulalia) and tell her Doug & Laura sent you! The beach was beautiful, white powdered sand, and the ocean floor was vaccuumed and the beach raked at least 3 times a day! Crystal clear waters, too! I've never been a pool person, but the pool at the Catalonia changed that...it's huge, extremely clean, and very comfortable. Not once did we have problems finding a beach chair, either at the pool or the beach, and we rarely got to either before 1pm. The entertainment was absolutely wonderful, and there are tons of things to do, so you won't have to worry about being bored, ever! There is a small shopping mall on the resort, with a pharmacy, a mini-market, jewellery store, spa services, a gym, a tobacco shop, and the best women's clothing store I have ever been in, even compared to Vancouver. Very good prices on everything, we found...the prices were definitely fair. The only thing I would not recommend purchasing at the shops would be sunblock ($14US) or mosquito repellant (same). As far as anything else, you won't pay through the nose for any of it. We bought milk to keep in our mini-bar for $2US. One thing, if you do walk down the beach off resort property, be prepared to be drawn in by the vendors...they are VERY persistent! And although you may think you're a great barterer and getting a good deal, you aren't. We bought a painting which although is very nice, we saw at the Punta Cana airport on the way home for half the price we paid. My advice...stay on the resort for shopping, you won't regret it. We did one excursion, the Marinarium to snorkel with nurse sharks and stingrays. I would definitely recommend this one, it's a half day excursion which ends with a swim in a lagoon on a sandbar where the water is waist-deep and crystal clear, and the bartender serves your drinks in the water. But BRING YOUR SUNBLOCK!!! I didn't, and I suffered for it later!

(Globalia was the name of this resort) The list of problems we encountered were slow and sometimes non existent transportation, overcrowded pool and beach areas, the beach at the Globalia was dirty, nasty attitudes, inappropriate comments, canceled dinner reservations, no follow through on promised massages, attitude to spare and to add insult to injury THEFT.

Maximo then came over and told us that we were going to stay at another resort for one day and then we would be back at the Catalonia the next day and have a VIP suite for the rest of our stay.

We asked what happened to the VIP suite, massages, etc... But all he said was, I don't know what you're talking about. Excuse me?!?! We tried to explain to him what he just said, but he refused to admit it. Then another guy came over, Jose Miguel de Jesus. He asked what the problem was and we tried to explain to him what just happened. All we got was, sorry but there are no rooms here for you. You will be staying at the other hotel 5 minutes away but can use the facilities at the Catalonia and we'll provide transportaion. We realized that it was useless to argue since we were in a forgein country and my Spanish is very limited. When we arrive at the other hotel, we realized we were down-graded. The place was no where as nice as the Catalonia. As soon as we checked and got our room, we decided to go back to the Catalonia. We found out that the Division Manager, Angel Juana was at our hotel so we waited for him. He said he would make sure to now give us 2 one hour massages each, whatever excursion we wanted, etc... But what happened was we got nothing. No massages. No excursions. Had to wait about an hour for transportation. Basically nothing but LIES!!!!! We even heard them give a free weeks stay to someone who had a dirty room. But they wouldn't even discuss the matter of restitution to us.
