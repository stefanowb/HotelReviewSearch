A stroll along the beach from Nerja, their hostel is situated on the side of a hill overlooking the beach, the sea, the mountains and the town. The view is spectacular, of the kind you dream about when you think of Spain. A short walk through Alix's beautiful garden and you are on the beach, ready for a dip in the mediterranean. Not only its location and outlook but the rooms are beautiful with amazing balconies overlooking it all, the price is so friendly and the hosts are charming. Kevin's restaurant is pretty phenomenal. We had our best meal of Spain there, the food is stupidly good and the view to die for. So if you're thinking of Nerja, go for Hostal Avalon, it's so close to the town if you need to go in and get your fix of the hullaballoo but then you can wander back home along the beach to dine in paradise.", "user": "AnnaLuke", "date": "May 25, 2012", "id": 130606047}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "My daughter and I with a close friend had superb meals at this delightful restaurant.

Even with a car it was sometimes hard to find parking in the city center. We opted to not get breakfast as I felt it was to expensive for what you got. We did get coffee every am which was fantastic. Also the Sangria was a bit over priced. It was $15 Euros for a picture. I got great tasting Sangria in town for $5. Overall great stay for the price and would not haste to go again.
