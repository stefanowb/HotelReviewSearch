I have been to Sao Paulo a number of times, but this was my first visit to Campinas. (Note - it is still the same congested trip to and from the airport. Each one took 1.5 to 2 hours.) Hotel was clean with very nice sized room and very pleasant staff. Based on my other stays in Brazil, I do not assume that finding English speaking staff will be a given. I had no problems while at the Vitoria. Due to the size of our group, our dinners were all arranged offsite, but both breakfast (individually at the hotel) and group lunches were at the Vitoria and the food was excellent. Finally, for business travelers, the property had a good space to accommodate four days of meetings with a group of about 30 people. The only negative I had is that the exercise area was placed right in the midst of the meeting area, with floor to ceiling windows, so it felt a bit exposed. It does have a spa, but I did not utilize while I was there. The surrounding area was pleasant and all in our group felt safe with walks to explore or go to local shops.

I understand it is a business and I understand the early check in fee... however, having stayed here so many times and having brought business to them, I think it is totally wrong that they apply this fee to me.
