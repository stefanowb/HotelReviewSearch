The reason the prices are so reasonable is that it is not smack-dab in the center of the action on HK Island. But it doesn't matter, because it's an easy 10-minute subway ride away from the action! There is really no reason to spend the extra $100 to stay in Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, or Central, if you can just hop on the subway from cheaper & quieter North Point which is just east from those bustling areas. The hotel is nice & clean and the staff are helpful. We had a toilet issue in the middle of the night and they sent a repair guy over within 10 minutes to fix it (it turned out it was our mistake and it wasn't even broken). You're not going to get a spacious room here, nor are you going to have a fancy spa bathroom. But it's perfectly fine if you're planning on spending most of your time out & about anyway. We enjoyed our time at the Ibis, and would recommend it to our friends & family.
