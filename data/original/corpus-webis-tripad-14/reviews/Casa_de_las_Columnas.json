It is in a wonderful historic building with lots of character. The courtyard is lovely and a wonderful place to relax and read while waiting for your travelling companion to get ready or for escaping the heat of the afternoon. The small pool is a great addition - it isn't large enough to really swim, but it perfect for cooling off and hanging out.", "title": "Nice place for visiting Merida", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "november_moon", "date": "March 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 155180109}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The people at the hotel are very gracious - everyone we met was wonderful.
