Capri was fantastic, but not necessarily this hotel. Our room was OK - loft style room with large balcony overlooking the Bay of Naples. We spent more time here than at the pool. The place was VERY DATED and in need of severe upgrading. The bathroom was from the 1960's - in my dreams. It was much, much older than that. We found the food and the service very, very good. We had a couple of lunches and one dinner at the restaurant, as well as the complimentary breakfast. We generally dined alone. The dinner was fantastic and, as the only people at the restaurant, the staff gave us all their attention.", "title": "Dated hotel, but great views", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ELDerby", "date": "July 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3702567}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Hope that Palatium will change!!!!", "text": "We found, while the views and the balcony was fantastic, the location was quite inconvenient.
