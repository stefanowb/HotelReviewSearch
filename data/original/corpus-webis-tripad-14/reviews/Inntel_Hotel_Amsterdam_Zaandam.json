Price was very good as well, and really modern. I have to say that we found lot of people eating at the restaurant, which was not our plan, but we tried and is not such bad, quality is good. Parking is closed to the hotel, a public parking on a shopping center, not expensive for dutch standards and discount applied by the hotel makes it less a pain, but on the neighbourhood you can find night parking as well, in an acceptable walking distance. Hotel room is very good, at any type. Have been several times and been on different ones, those with bath and inroom sauna are great, big space, lighting good, and each room has different decoration, which you can see at the entrance door of each room, original must say.

It looks very different and impressive from outside but several issues frustrated me. Firstly, having gone in to ask where the hotel car park was, we parked up and walked up to the hotel and casually I thought I'd check we could get out early in the morning (ready for the markets we planned to visit) to find it was 7am to 11pm only. Having travelled all day I didn't feel energised enough to drive around looking for another car park. We then got to the room to find we were looking out at the side of a rooftop 10m away - so no decent view. Hell, I thought, they offer a spa and massage, let me get a back rub at least. 4 calls later they explained that they couldn't do this in the next few hours, so that didn't work. At least I could catch up on my emails.... Oh no I couldn't, I just could not connect to what looked like a good wifi signal. I called reception who advised I disable the firewall on my iPad... I didn't think iPad's had firewalls so I thought I'd google that... oops, no wifi of course. I put my shoes back on, went down to reception and said, go on then, how do I do that? They accepted it was probably a router issue so they'd reset it and try again. But no luck. So I sat in the noisy bar and bought beer and tried to work.", "user": "skyjockey99", "date": "April 9, 2013", "id": 157206660}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "We stayed at the Golden Tulip for 2 nights.

A small, flat screen TV provided the entertainment consisting mainly of Dutch language TV channels, though CNN International was also available. The bathroom was clean and modern. The shower was a bit of a challenge to operate, but once you got the hang of it, there was adequate water pressure and excellent temperature control. There was a half \"door\" on the shower side of the tub/shower unit, and if the shower wasn't aimed just so, you'd end up with a lot of water on the floor. Be sure to aim the shower downward!
