No elevator so going up flights of stairs with heavy suitcases was not fun...though most people would not be bothered since this seems to be a businessman's hotel and thus luggage would normally be minimal. To be fair the receptionist did offer to help us...but really that is not his job. The 2nd floor was very squeaky so you could here every person who walked by. Free internet access in lobby but not in rooms...no way were we going to pay 15.00 pounds for this. Bar man in lobby really should not be in this job...not only does he never smile but he never looks up to see if there are any customers in the lobby who might like a drink, let alone a refill. The coffee shop/atrium; how sad it looks...the paint on all the chairs is chipped...some really badly..it can't cost that much to have them sprayed surely. The carpet and walls are a puce green. Staff are friendly and trying to do a good job but in need of lots of training..their lack of experience is very apparent. Parking is free so that is a plus. Reception was efficient. Rooms very small, tired looking and bed lumpy.
