The bed is always incredible. Unfortunately the bed was the only thing positive about the Westin Michigan Avenue. After sleeping in the Heavenly Bed the first night, we discovered a surprise hiding beside the bed in the form of a condom, most likely used. Obviously the housekeeping was not up to par. After we checked out, we realized that we had left a shirt in the room. Upon returning a few hours later, we discovered that the housekeeping had improved their process and already cleaned our room and thrown the shirt away. If you want a Westin in Chicago, I would stay at the Westin River North.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "danjohn", "date": "January 21, 2006", "id": 4368007}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006", "text": "My daughter and I have just returned from our first visit to Chicago having stayed in the Westin Michegan Avenue for 5 nights from 29 Dec through 3rd Jan '06. The Hotel certainly exceeded our expectations as we had read some unpleasant slow service reviews in advance but the price being withing our budget we still opted for the Westin Michegan Avenue. Be advised that the Restaurant is not operated by the Westin. There are numerous wonderful breakfast/dinner options within a few minutes. We even had a corner view over Lake Michegan whilst still facing The famous Cheesecake factory across the street.We are delighted to recommend this Hotel to anybody wishing for a great nights sleep in a very proffessionally run Hotel in the beat Chicago city centre location and yet one block from Lake Michegan for my morning walk.Conceierge, accommmodation, reception staff and duty manager Kerri are all that you would expect from a Westin.

The Grill, which I had several opportunities to use, was excellent although, quite honestly they clearly have never heard of portion control. Frighteningly large platters of food are the norm.

We promptly went back to reception and were assigned to another room. The room itself was quite nice with the heavenly bed, and marble bath.

My wife and arrived on Saturday Mar 18th for an expected 5 day surgical conference for her. With an infant we expected the Westin to be a pleasant respite from work and a chance for our family to spend some quality time in Chicago. However, upon check-in at 8pm we were told that there were no rooms ready yet (that's right--8PM!) and we could expect about an hour wait. When I informed the management that we had a 2 month old that had traveled most of the day and needed fed/nursed we were given vouchers to the smoking friendly bar. Needless to say, eventually we convinced them that the bar was unacceptable and they obliged with room service (once we got into our room at 915 pm). Unfortunately the crib (which too had been long requested months ago) took another 45 minutes. Day 2 began ominously enough as the room remained uncleaned at 430pm and when we returned at 8pm we discovered one of our Ipods missing. One of the young managers eventually stepped in and helped us file a security incident and with luck before our trip ends the Ipod will be replaced, although they asked that we not file a police report. Nonethless, the drama continued and despite multiple contacts with management (Kerri eventually provided meals and massages) we came home the 4th day to discover that we were locked out of our room because \"we thought you checked out\" despite all of our clothes and baby gear still in the room. I could go on and on (such as the desk clerk telling me that they do not have a microwave that a guest could use to sterilize bottles or failing to charge our company credit card) but the point is that if you have a choice in Chicago AVOID the Westin like the plague. Aside from the manager (Kerri) making some effort the Westin is a poor organization run by mostly inept staff. I have been to many Westins and I am a SPG member but this as I overheard one guest say \"is like a Motel 6.\" To make matters worse, even if the trip had been blemish free, the Westin comes across as a run-down hotel with big prices, a useless lobby, a fair to poor fitness center, a tiny spa and a clueless staff.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 21, 2006", "id": 4722941}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "My daughter and I stayed at the Westin on Michigan Avenue from March 7 to March 10.
