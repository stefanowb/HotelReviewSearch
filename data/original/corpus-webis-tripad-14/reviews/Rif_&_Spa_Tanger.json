Location is good, and most rooms have views of the sea, and walk across the street to the beach, food, and bars. No women on the beach, but many places to dine on the strip and better then staying extremely down town. All hotels are less than a five minute walk from on another (except Marriott), but the others are all clustered together and feel conjested (previous hotel was very dark 'Tanjah'). Decent pool, nice bar, has room service (but very limited menu-12 items, no vegetarian). Staff seems to sleep walk, but I noticed that with many people at work. No tours from hotel, unless you want a 'private tour' which is a taxi (car was crap). Walk to office of tourism is less than 10 minutes, but we went four times and it wasn't open. Need a taxi for co-ed beaches. Claims wifi, but doesn't work in the room (I was on the fifth floor) so I had to go to the lobby to use it. All in all I would book again for the location and room comfort, because its a few blocks from the hustle and bustle which gets overwhelming. But if you want that, it's less than a five minute walk (uphill).
