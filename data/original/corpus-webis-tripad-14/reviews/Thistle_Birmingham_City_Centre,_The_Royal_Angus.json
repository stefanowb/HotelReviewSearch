Fistly, if you're coming by road, it's not well signposted and is easy to miss - even with sat.nav. Coming in on the A38 keep going further than the website indicates towards the city centre - look for the Dental Hospital on the left and the hotel is immediately adjacent- apparently built as an after- thought under a large NCP carpark, which provides the hotel parking. It's on a one-way system, so miss it and you have a hefty detour to get back.", "title": "Bland, boring Brum", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Clarissa_Firebucket", "date": "March 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 7238293}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 41, "average": 93, "very good": 115, "terrible": 31, "excellent": 51}, "aka": "Thistle Birmingham City Hotel Birmingham", "slim_ranking": 0.471014492754, "description": "At Thistle Birmingham City, our city-centre location makes us an ideal venue for both business and leisure travellers.
