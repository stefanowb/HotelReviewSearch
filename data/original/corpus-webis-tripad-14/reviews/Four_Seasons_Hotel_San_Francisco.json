The mattress and bedding were incredibly comfortable. On par if not better than Westin's Heavenly beds. The view from my room was excellent. AT&T park was in clear view as was the water. The room was very clean and the bar area was stocked with usual suspects and San Francisco based snacks. The bathroom was large. There's a stand up shower as well as separate tub. The toilet is in it's own room off the bathroom. The water pressure was strong but not damaging. They use L'Occitane products which are nice. Guests of the hotel have access to the Sports Club/LA which is attached on the 4th floor. This is an excellent gym and should be taken advantage of. The bar area on the lobby floor is well done.
