My fiance is in a wheelchair and they do have 1 accessible room which many places like this do not. 2 of the other rooms would have probably been adequate for her also. They even saved the front parking space for us when we arrived. . She was in heaven because it finally gave us a chance to try a B&B/cottage. The grounds are beautiful and it was nice waking up and walking out to the pool area only a few feet away. im not a breakfast eater but i couldnt wait to eat. Its a full breakfast. Bacon,eggs,sausage,sausage gravy and biscuits, fresh fruit,bagles,toast,coffee, and juices. I highty recommend Ambrosia as a place to stay in Key West.
