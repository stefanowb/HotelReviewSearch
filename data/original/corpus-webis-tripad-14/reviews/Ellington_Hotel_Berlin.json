I even paid a lot more to have a superior room. What I got was a family room with bunk beds (I was travelling on business so last thing I needed), it was meant to have a king bed but was just two single beds pushed together. No soap or shampoo but some horrible detergent stuck on the wall of the shower ... and the shower was in the bedroom (no door you shower a few feet from the bed). The room was decorated about as cheaply as you could get - curtains where just backing material with no proper drapes. The room was really noisy - went on until the early morning and the airconditioning didn't work.", "title": "What an awful hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "charles a", "date": "September 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 117600727}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel staff where as bad as the room - tried to charge for internet and breakfast even though included in the rate but they refused to believe it until I created a fuss.", "title": "Great Location - rest average", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Hanseat", "date": "September 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 117572112}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "Berlin has lots of fabulous hotels - this was not one of them in my experience.
