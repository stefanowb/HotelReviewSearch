We were warmly greeted at the front desk by Peter and a female employee. Peter gave us lots of helpful information about the hotel. For those expecting the Ritz Carlton and its amenities- this is not. But, the Trianon Old Naples is a beautiful, charming hotel that has comfortable beds with quality linens, large rooms, a friendly and helpful staff (all shifts). The complimentary continental breakfast consists of bagels, breads, muffins, danish, cereals, fruit, juices, and coffee/tea - more than adequate for a continental breakfast. Something that I loved was that after enjoying breakfast, I could grab a coffee to go from the buffet for our early morning walk since cups and lids were also provided. The location is perfect to walk to 5th Avenue restaurants and shops ( 2 blocks away) and to Tin City (2 blocks the other way).", "title": "Perfect Location in Old Naples", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CrazyForCaribbean", "date": "September 8, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117844155}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011", "text": "We decided to leave the car at the hotel and walk to the beach many times (about 8 -10 blocks).
