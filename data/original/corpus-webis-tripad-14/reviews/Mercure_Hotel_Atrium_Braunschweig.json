Room was very basic but extremely clean compared to most hotels in US. Mattress wasn't very comfortable... Like a thin futon mattress. The AC when turned on had a terrible smell... Had to check under bed just to be sure nothing dead was under it. So I kept off and window open; noise from street and trams didn't run to late keeping me awake or thanks to jet lag, I slept like a rock. I had free decent Internet and breakfast over priced but no other option around but McDonalds. I did take tram to city center and enjoyed the evening there. Knowing very little German it was still easy to get around on my own. Guess I'll stay again with no options near the office.", "user": "Daphne418", "date": "August 2, 2013", "id": 170502065}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel was well positioned near the train station and tram stops.
