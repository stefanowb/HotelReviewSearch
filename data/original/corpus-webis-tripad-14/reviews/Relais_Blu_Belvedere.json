We had a lovely room with fabulous bathroom. Lovely view from our room. The main terrace is amazing with views of Capri to die for. The infinity pool is lovely with a wonderfully glorious view over the gulf. We dined in the restaurant, this was a very enjoyable experience if not somewhat expensive, however you do get freebies throughout. I have a couple of suggestions that would make this a perfect place.", "user": "UkSand", "date": "October 16, 2013", "id": 181276688}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013", "text": "I would like to have a lighter hairdryer in the bathroom with a button that you dont have to keep your finger on to keep it on , hairdryer so heavy and difficult to use.", "title": "Ridiculous views, bathrooms, and service!
