The rooms are well appointed and recently refurbished, however, the bathroom renovation was done cheaply so it is the poorest element of the hotel. The lighting in the bathrooms is terrible it really does need to be addressed. One minor quibble is that it is disappointing not to have an iPhone/iPod dock as most modern hotels seem to have. Any minor issues with fit out are well and truly outweighed by the excellent service I have experienced in two stays since it switched to Hilton management. Staff have been friendly and courteous and genuinely will go the extra yard for you, something uncommon in most Darwin Hotels. This helpfulness extends very much to the restaurant staff,i particularly the breakfast team who are always welcoming and helpful no matter how busy they are. This is a well managed property that I would recommend for business and for a couples get away but make sure you get an ocean view room where you will be able to take in the spectacular sunset over the Arafura Sea.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "David H", "date": "May 23, 2013", "id": 161562054}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012", "text": "Recently rebranded from the holiday inn.", "title": "Great hotel, lovely location and lots special touches", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kerrykerry050", "date": "May 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 161443592}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Nice and bright hotel, right by the water.", "title": "Great views, average quality accomodations", "user": "Sheila C", "date": "May 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161220455}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Tropical gardens with a nice pool and restaurant.", "title": "Basic Hotel in a good position", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ddh04", "date": "May 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 161116731}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Nice touches such as a cookie on arrival and willing to help with anything you need.
