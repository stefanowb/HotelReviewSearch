This is now our new favorite place to stay! It is so glamourous and modern. We loved all the glitz and technology. Very swanky. We have previously stayed at Bellagio, Encore, Palazzo, Treasure Island & Mandalay Bay. We reserved a terrace suite and connecting terrace 1 bedroom for our kids. Both rooms were very spacious and the kids enjoyed all that space to run around in. The reception desk was very close to the valet entrance and parking elevators, therefore there was no need to find your way though the maze of slot machines just to get to your room (we requested a room in the west tower in order to get this proximity convenience). They also were kind enough to put us in rooms close to the elevators so our kids wouldn't have to walk too far. The terrace suites come equipped with full kitchens (stove, oven, dishwasher, fridge) but sadly no cookware, coffee maker or utensils :(. If you plan ahead, you can bring a small pan with you to cook some bacon and eggs for breakfast. Would save you a lot of $$. We used the washer and dryer at the end of our trip so that I wouldn't have to do laundry when we got home. What a nice perk! Just remember to bring laundry soap and dryer sheets. The fridge space was more than adequate. You get the top shelf as well as a slide-out drawer and 2 freezer drawers! Had enough space for a gallon of milk, 6 pack of beer, soda, water, fruit, snacks, etc. The beds were very comfy. They had the best pillows I've ever experience at a hotel. The terrace 1 bedroom also came with a sofa bed that was perfect for our 3 year-old. The management in the hotel is stellar! The GM was chatting with us in the elevator and since we gushed about how great our stay was, he had warm cookies and milk sent right up to us! What a nice surprise! As far as housekeeping, no issues there whatsoever. Our room was clean upon arrival and was thoroughly tidy'd up daily while we were out. The view of the Bellagio fountains was absolutely amazing! A hotel in Vegas with a balcony is very hard to come by. As far as dining, we tried the Henry and Wicked spoon for breakfast. Both good. We had Holsteins one night for dinner and everyone was raving about the burgers. Highly recommend you try it. If you join \"Indentity\" (players club) and present your card at all the stores and restaurants on property, you get points! Every staff member we encountered were kind, courteous and helpful. Of course, we are very pleasant people so I'm sure the smiles on our face elicited better service.

Biggest problem there was that the nightclub and pool are are on that side with the nightclub sounds audible until 4am. Won't stay on that side again!

I went for a business conference. This was my second trip to the Cosmo. I felt that I should warn what to expect for a hotel that claims it is 5 stars. If you like being abused this place is for you! Everything went wrong except for check in and check out. When I first arrived I had the bell hop take my bags and give me a ticket and told me to call the front desk after check in . Once I got to the room ...things started to go bad to worse. Everything went wrong.. first my phone did not work or the tv or the wifi. So I called the front desk using my cell phone. It took over a hour after the call to get my bags.I did not have cell phone reception in my room and had to use the balcony outside to make cell phone calls. I also called front desk to mention that there was not any phone or TV available. They said they were having a issue with the computer network and it should be resolved the next day. Well the next day late afternoon after exploring the sights of Las Vegas still no phone or TV. They explained that they were sorry and would change my room . Plus I told them that housekeeping did not remove room service breakfast dishes. I told them I had a tour scheduled that evening and wouldn't be back till 11pm. When I came back dirty dishes were still in room and they said they didn't have a room available with phone or tv and would get someone to pick up the dishes. At this point I left this pIace and went to play games at Aria, stayed up all night and when I came back the next morning dirty dishes still in room. I called room service for breakfast and I was told it was an hour wait this was at 7am. I ordered a double espresso. An hour later I got a double espresso decaffinated said they were out of regular espresso. (Dishes were finally picked up) Who ever heard of double espresso decaffinated?? Extremely frustrated and in tears with everything going wrong I went to the front desk they said they would give me two nights free stay and 200 comp for dinner. Yes that was generous but if you can't get service properly why bother. Camping in a tent is less hassle.This was my second stay and the first stay had hassles as well. I am very hesitant to stay here again as it is a 8 hour flight to Vegas and I don't need the hassles. Yes I do have two free days but who needs the abuse and hassle. with housekeeping room service etc. I have stayed at other hotels ranging from 3 to 5 stars and you don't get hassled like that.

Balconies which allow you get outside and relax and sometimes wifi actually works outside, not often, but even in the rooms, it is spotty. Restaurants in the building that are actually good. An espresso place for the morning. All are plusses. Now for the negative, in the 17 times I have stayed here, never once has my room been completely ready when I got to it. There have been several times where there are no towels, none. Beds have been unmade upon arrival which is just not ok. The Tv's rarely work correctly and if they do, you need to cherish the moment as they won't work for long. Yet, being a glutten for punishment I continue to return. On my last trip, I checked in, was charged an upgrade fee (not normal for a Marriott platinum guest) and was \"upgraded\" to the room I normally get for the same price. Ok, not a huge deal as the nature of an upgrade is a gift, not a given. I arrived in my room to find that there was an empty champagne bottle and two diry glasses on the balcony along with cigar butts in the ashtray. It was late, I opted to go to bed and just ignore it as I I had mentioned, I keep coming back for more. At 10p I notice the message light is on so I call down and check messages. I am told I have no messages, no biggie, techology is not a huge thing for the hotel. At 5a, my phone begins to ring. At 5.30, my door is opening and a security is standing in my room telling me I missed my wake up call. I tell him I did not have a wake up call. He stares at me while I am in bed and then says oh and leaves the room. I am up now at 5.30a. I attempt to put my toothbrush etc away in the bathroom drawer only to realize that in the drawer is a used makeup, false eylashes, tooth brush, and garbage from the previous guest. This was my breaking point, I finally get the gumption to go to the front desk and complain calmy. I do this and manager comes out, apoligizes by comping the room which was a great gesture as I told him. I told him really I didn't care about the money, although I appreciated it, however what I really needed was someone to just clean the room. He assures me that he will personally see to it that the room is cleaned top to bottom. Great, seems alert, seems like it is finally going to go well. I get back from work at 9p that night, the room was not touched, the towels not even replace, it was completly skipped by housekeeping for the day.

The pools felt small and crowded, but they were great. We got a daybed by the boulevard on Saturday and would not have found a seat without it. Only two things annoyed me about the pool. First is that I emailed a week prior to our trip to book a daybed and was quoted a price. Then called after checking in and they gave me a lower price. We decided to make sure we were that we wouldn't be hungover before we booked it. So Saturday morning we went down and got it for an even cheaper price. It annoyed me that I would have been punished for booking early. The second thing that annoyed me was the service. We had to order lunch 3 times over 2.5 hours to finally get it. We would have to order drinks from two different runners in hopes of getting a drink. Not like any other nice resort that I've stayed at. Not even the service level of hard rocks pool.

We checked into a one bedroom suite for 3 nights, and upon check-in, we knew something was off kilter with the service. It was very clear the girl at the desk has never worked in a hotel before (\"you're staying for 4 nights right? What? Oh, only 3 nights? Oh. Ok. Whatever.\"), but we got to our room which was actually quite nice. By 10pm and after a long day of traveling and sight seeing, we were looking forward to a good night's sleep. WRONG. We walked into our room and everything was vibrating. There was a pool party going on at Marquis, a nightclub inside the hotel, and there was thumping house music blaring SO loud, everything in the bedroom was vibrating. We looked out the balcony and sure enough, from the 29th floor, we could hear EVERYTHING. We looked into the hotel book and it said that weekend pool parties end at 11pm, and we thought we'd be safe. By 11h30pm, it was louder. I kept my composure and called the concierge desk and they said \"Oh it's going to go till 4am tonight and tomorrow night\". When I asked what they can do about this, they offered ear plugs. Just so everyone knows, when music is THAT loud, ear plugs don't do anything. When I asked to speak to the general manager to switch to a quieter room, he said \"the hotel is fully booked, so we can't switch your room\". This was TOTAL BS, as Vegas hotels do NOT fill up easily, and when I went online to book a sample room for that night, there was plenty of availability in the hotel. I told him he could give us a cheaper room, that a DOWNGRADE as long as it's QUIET, was totally ok with us. With many phone calls back and forth with all levels of management, they were extremely abrupt and all responded with \"You're only getting earplugs\". This was totally unacceptable.
