It was private and elegantly decorated. The room was kept spotless with a thorough cleaning every day - I mean thorough, bathroom scrubbed, floors swetp and mopped, kitchen cleaned. Unlike other studio rooms, we had a full separte kitchen with a 2 burner cooktop as well as convection oven. Shops were close by for mini market, bank and bakery. Bed was a king size pillow top mattress - very comfortable. Roof top balcony was very nice with large umbrella and 2 chairs - stairs are steep to get to the rooftop, but if no mobility problems very nice. Bathroom also has 3 steps down to get into it, so again if mobility is an issue Room had large room safe, able to fit small laptop.
