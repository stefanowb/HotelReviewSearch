Owner Nikos spoke excellent English. He was extremely warm and friendly. He gave us a room on the ground floor with discount (all the rooms upstairs with view of meteora were taken.) Their main business is the tavern (I think?) with delicious greek food (souvlaki) and breakfast (which is included) is served there as well. My spouse wasn't feeling well on the night of our arrival, so Nikos offered us room service with complimentary bottled water. Complimentary breakfast was awesome with omelet, bread, cheese, jam, juice, tea and coffee. Accepts credit cards too, which is great, but only Nikos knows how to operate it (ATM is in the next town, few minutes by bus.) Bus to Meteora is only a short walk away and Nikos will provide you with all the bus/train departure information you'll need.", "title": "Great hospitality", "user": "sg_stef", "date": "July 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 70161977}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "Room was very clean with good a/c and a balcony.
