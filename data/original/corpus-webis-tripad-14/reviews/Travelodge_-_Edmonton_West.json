BIG mistake! The rate I got was spend 2 nights get 15% off. Well in the small script what you dont see is if you book with this \"special\" rate you cannot get a refund for any reason. No cancelations, No Modificatins, No refund for no shows. My parents offered for us to stay at their house so I tried to cancel the reservation since it would be better to stay somewhere for free than in a dump like this hotel sounds. Especailly for the 700 bucks we are giving them.. I wonder what will happen when we go there and we hate it. We are booked for 6 days and I dont know what to do.... I dont care I will never stay at any Travelodge again", "title": "So Scared", "user": "jcawthorn", "date": "December 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 22840413, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Couldnt tell ya", "disliked": "\u2014 Staff"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Disgusting dump", "text": "We checked in at 1pm and could not stay there past 5pm!

We were freezing! I demanded being moved to another room and found the same dinginess, the freezing air was traveling through the air conditioner, the sheets had other peoples hair-I doubt they were ever washed, AND THE TOILET WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT CLEANED! Disgusting!!!!. We were NOT going to stay there so we packed up and went to the Front desk, we told them we could not take the hotel and we were freezing! The desk clerk said my credit card would not be charges because we were only there for 4 hours...I'll be checking my credit card to make sure I was not charged!

We had a room that allowed for our dog to join us, and at first we thought that perhaps the room was dirty because it was a pet room. After reading other reviews I realized our room was really no exception. Though I looked, and looked for signs of bed bugs and did not find any, there was a white powder along the base of the walls. We brought all of our clothing home in garbage bags, and washed everything, including our dog once home. I have been seriously praying that we didn't bring any unwanted bugs home with us. We would have moved to another hotel in a heartbeat but everything was booked throughout Edmonton due to a rodeo thing. I would NEVER stay there again, and I was relieved to leave the place.
