The staff was extremely warm and welcoming. The house has been redone beautifully yet simply and in consistent good taste and is very charming. The garden, where we had tea in the afternoon, and the grounds are lovely. The dinners were wonderfully prepared with all the freshest ingredients and absolutely delicious -- right through to the homemade cannoli (yum). Our room was large and comfortable, with a large bathroom and old-fashioned shudders on the windows. We had a view of the ruins, illuminated at night -- a sight I will never forget. The house is a short walk from the museum and entrance to the ruins. We visited the museum, strolled through the ruins, and had lunch in the garden of the restaurant just outside of the far gate. Perfect. But best of all were the people -- the entire staff of Il Granaio. Thank you all for making our visit so much fun!!! We love you !!! P.S.

The host Laura and her husband couldn't be nicer. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. The hotel is clean, nicely appointed, and the area is tranquil and safe. The food in their restaurant is excellent and it seems even well-heeled locals do frequent the restaurant, not just hotel guests. I hope to be able to return again very soon.
