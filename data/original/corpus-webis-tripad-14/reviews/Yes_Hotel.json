Make sureBooked this hotel months in advance and had everything confirmed by e-mail. Had read on Trip advisor that the hotel had previously baited people with the new Yes hotel to only switch its visitors to its older sister hotel. Forewarned we thought this would not happen to us. Upon our arrival at the hotel after a long intercontinental flight we were told that there were technical difficulties with our Rome and we would had been rebooked to the sister hotel. This sounded very familiar! We argued our case and told them that we would not accept this as we had read about there practices on Tripadvisor. The receptionist became very defensive and told us that the heating was not working properly and that our room would be too cold. Strangely enough lots of other guests came and went who managed to stay in the \"too cold room\" while were discussing this all. But what can one do when you arrive dead tired with two young children and lots of luggage in mid December in Rome? Eventually we accepted our fate and accepted our transfer to the sister hotel a few streets down the road. The hotel is nice but much older and appeared to be full of young people, it felt more like a youth hostel! Room was spacious for 4 people and the staff extremely helpful and friendly. This does not take away the fact that we felt ripped of, we were charged the same price as for the Yes hotel and got an old and much more down market hotel instead!", "title": "Beware", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Clogs43", "date": "January 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 12803367}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just returned from Rome-came acrcoss this hotel by accident and was able to arrange a good rate as Rome is fairly empty now(Jan 08).
