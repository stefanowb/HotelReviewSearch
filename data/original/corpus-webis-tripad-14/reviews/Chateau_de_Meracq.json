What luck we had. We were met by Jean-Pierre, and our adventure began. We were given the choice of two rooms, and chose the larger one, which had ceilings perhaps 11-12' high, a king bed (two twins pushed together as is the custom in Europe), a sitting area with a bowl of fruit, and a large modern bathroom with aqua blue tiles and with both a shower and a tub. The decor was very pleasant and homey and real. This is not a place that is trying to be a castle and would not appeal to people seeking a \"castle-experience\" complete with tapestries and stone walls etc. It is very much someone's home, with personal objects and touches.", "title": "A culinary treasure in a tranquil country setting", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "BookWriter2", "date": "October 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10067649, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The food!"}}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Aquitaine", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 4}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
