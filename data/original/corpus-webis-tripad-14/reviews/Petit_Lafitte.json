All of the reviews were very accurate. Great food, warm and friendly people, and superior service. We enjoyed very good snorkeling from the beach. We enjoyed a snorkeling trip and parasailing booked at the onsite dive shop. We enjoyed the privacy of cabanas 14 and 15. The pool was fantastic and the other guests and their children were very friendly. We look forward to our next visit. We have already reccomended this hotel to several friends interested in the area.

This hotel is right on the water nestled a short distance between the Tides and Princess resorts, both much larger. Before each of those resorts, there is a short distance of small homes, undeveloped areas and small businesses. So, although anyone can walk along the public beaches, this small hotel feels somewhat private. The beach is beautiful - great sand, beautiful blue water.

The bathroom itself consists of a toilet and shower. The toilet seat had a very wide base --- I felt like I was going to fall through! Our bed had a bedspread (hate them) and keyed door. My sister's unit had a duvet though -- would have preferred that. The TV had limited English language channels and of those, CNN did not come in clearly. The resort WiFi was hit or miss.
