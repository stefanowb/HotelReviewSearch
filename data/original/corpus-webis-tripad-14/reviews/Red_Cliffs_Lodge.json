I sat out there whenever we had a free moment, listening to the birds, watching the water flow, taking in the gorgeous weather and relaxing. And it was so quiet! I could have stayed for a month! The ride to and from Moab is one of the most beautiful drives I've ever experienced; and we never got tired of it. The pool area is quite huge and the views are gorgeous; laundry room w/ice machine, and gym nearby. The staff was very friendly.

Aside from their own buildings, there's not another structure in sight, just fantastic views of the towering red cliffs, the Colorado River, and local wildlife. They do everything right, have a terrific restaurant (we were blown away by a first-rate dinner for 2 for ~$45) and their own winery, and you wake up in paradise. The attention to detail tells me that they really do place their guests' interests first. We enjoyed it so much that when we found we could not extend our stay a night because they were completely booked on the Memorial Day weekend, we flew home a day early rather than endure the let-down of a lesser hotel in a lesser location.

We had no idea until we saw it in daylight just how spectacular this road was as it followed the river winding its way through the valley. Soaring red cliffs on either side, this scenic highway just has to be driven. Red Cliffs Lodge is 12 miles along this road, and we had booked a River View Mini King suite, which was quite magnificent. We couldn't believe our luck - it was beautifully furnished, spacious, very clean and exactly what the website promised. The bathroom was well designed and the bedroom huge. Going down a few steps, there was an excellent kitchen and dining area leading on to our individual patio. On waking in the morning the view took our breath away. Awesome! Looking out over the Colorado River towards the legendary \"western film\" backdrop of Castle Rock, it was heaven. With a few cows peacefully grazing by the river bank just yards from our patio, and enormous red cliffs to the side and behind us, we knew we could not have found a better location for a few days' stay. The Lodge breakfast was exceptionally good with a great choice of cold and cooked food, and we had the choice of eating inside or outside on the patio. The Lodge is ideally placed for Arches National Park, Canyonlands and Moab. Our two days were spent visitng Arches and hiking up Negro Bill's Canyon a few miles from the Lodge. This is a must do. We didn't have time to do any horse-riding which looked great fun from the Lodge ranch, and unfortunately it was too early to see the vineyard in all its glory. BUT one evening we experienced the most fantastic sunset. We discovered why this is called \"Red Cliffs Lodge\" because Castle Rock in front of us turned the most fabulous reddish colour and we were completely awestruck. You could not possibly find a better location for adventure, activities, touring or just simply relaxing and enjoying the spectacular views. We would recommend Red Cliffs Lodge to everyone. The service was first class; the evening food was very tasty; and everyone was helpful and very friendly. It was a wonderful visit and one of the best places in which we have ever stayed. Moab was heaving as the jeep safari had taken over the town for the weekend, but Red Cliffs Lodge was a little bit of heaven, peace and luxury.
