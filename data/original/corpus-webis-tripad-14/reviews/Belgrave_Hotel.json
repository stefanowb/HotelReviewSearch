As other's comment the hotel looks nothing from the exterior We were welcomed with a friendly greeting from the receptionist. Our room 212 was spotlessly clean a little small but perfectly acceptable. The bathroom again was spotlessly clean and well appointed with a lovely shower which feels like a power shower. The bed is very comfy. One word of warning to the ladies, the hairdryer in the room did not work and even though the receptionist gave me access to another room to try theirs that one did not work either! The breakfast is basic but acceptable. The best thing about the hotel is the location, 100 yards to the Oval tube, on the Northern line only 5 stops from Leicester Square, so you are in central London in 10 minutes. A great value hotel.

Overall an excellent over night stay ,clean , warm , and freindly service most welcoming.The rooms are not massive but reasonable and with SKYSPORTS 1 2 Clean and warm interior the feelings good. The hotel staff very helpfull . Didnt have to wait to get in at the front door in the early hours of New years day 2012. Parking at the back of HOTEL bit of a small area but was exceptable and convienent concidering the time i had to find else were would of possibly cost more and taken time to find being new to the area. The showers are lovely ,no water coming on to the floor like some hotel rooms wich is a pain especially when you get dressed and your soaks get wet when you keep goin in the bathroom to spruce youre self up on occassions to get ready for youre night out. The beds were very very comfy lots of spring in them very pleasnat nights sleep.Some beds can be a bit to solid.. The central heating i put on in the room was put on immediately as the hotel bedroom window was open and there was a bit of a chill in the room. The room soon heated up and in the middle of the night had to turn it of as the room was very warm . Good for a winters night most pleasing. When we awoke i realised Breakfast was served untill 10:30am and we didnt depart our room untill 11:30am as it was new years day and had a late night. On our way to the car to put my beloning back for our return journey home the Hotel Manager very well spoken ask us if we had enjoyed our stay and if we had had breakfast. Wich we oviuosly answerd no bit of a late one last night. He then kindly escorted us to a small and clean dining area and seated us and said it would be ok to have breakfast ,coffee , tea and frshly squeezed orange juice , cereals.. fruit.. We were delighted to say the least and and soon sat down and enduldged in a tasty Fry up and Bacon,Sausage,Mushroom, etc . Coffe tea orange juice what a star..
