Be sure if you are getting your drinks and coffee in the market place to ask for a punch card. (Get a free one with so many purchases) They finally gave me one on my 6th day!

That does not mean that I do not grumble about a few missing elements. Do not expect a bell hop - the property is currently working with Marriott and the board to offer this service. Tip: There are luggage carts (usually 3 or 4) at the elevators within the underground parking. There is usually one at check in as well. Do not expect 4 or 5 star dining at the resort. The food is minimalist. The Honu Bar, poolside, has great drinks, but try to come prepared by lining up your food stash prior to arrival - don't pay $10 bucks for a salad in a plastic shell. The Kiawe Grill is closed Tuesday and Wednesday (this is the closest thing to full service restaurant on the property). Tip: stop a Sueoka's Market in Koloa town for your food and drink. They have a ton of local food - portuguese sausage, ahi/tako poke, and more. Also, they have a reasonable selection of beer, wine, etc. For excellent dinners out, try the Beach House (towards spouting horn) and Roy's Poipu across the street at the Shopping Village. These are expensive alternatives, but worth it. The views at the Beach House are stunning (also, try the top shelf Mai Tai). Tip: For less expensive local fare, head into Lihue for breakfast (Tip Top Cafe or Oki Diner).
