It's great if you have a car, or are there on business, but if you want more of a scene, there are better choices. That said, Frankfurt is a very walkable city with great public transportation, so I wasn't so disappointed. I could walk to the train station in the center of town in 10 minutes, and to the more touristy sections in 15. Or I could walk 5 minutes to the local subway. It really is 5 minutes though, not 30 seconds. Even better that there are often discounts on this hotel, so I got my room at a great price. For someone who doesn't usually stay in 4-star places... and was considering a hostel room for just a little less, I thought this was a steal. The bathroom with the heated tiles was a nice treat, as was the TV and wi-fi. Because I got my room at a discount though, I think they gave me a pretty bad room. I was a single traveler, but I wound up in a pretty small double facing the back. They did let me check in early without any hassle though. I guess I'm pretty satisfied, the trip was fun.", "title": "Highly recommend", "user": "jaybyrdCO", "date": "May 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 30932459}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "excellent hotel experience; great multilingual staff, spotless rooms, very good restaurant, access to tram, Ubahn.", "title": "Good for a convention, not really for tourism", "user": "mlockwood", "date": "May 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 30731049}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is next to the convention center (Feste Halle).

Everything was very nice & well maintained. They also provide free wifi. The staff and service was top class. The windows were floor to ceiling and wall to wall, so lots of light.

Depending where you are on the fair grounds, it will take you at most ten minutes by foot to reach the Moevenpick. It's about the same distance to the central station. I liked the design of the hotel very much. It's architecture is not groundbreaking but nice, the interior of the rooms is modern and stylish and not too cold. The staff is most friendly and the bar quite enjoyable. There are only two negative aspects I have to mention: First, the size of the standard room, which is quite small. Second, there is a large construction site nearby witk work all night long. If you close your window, it's no problem, otherwise it's quite noisy.

The staff went above & beyond their call of duty from the front desk clerks to the bar tenders & wait staff. We enjoyed our stay & would definitely revisit this hotel if ever in Frankfurt again. We checked in quite early ( around 11:00 am) as our International flight arrived earlier than expected but that never seemed to present a problem at check-in as they accomodated us with great warmth & professionalism. The room & entire hotel is very modern & clean. The restaurant & bar have good food, drinks and service. The hotel is quite convenient to the Transit system, just a short 5-10 min walk to subway, trolleys & train station. They helped us with train travel info. & tours at the front desk. Every morning the cleaning crew left you candy on your pillow. Their coffee is delicious and the bar area is open late for food & drinks. Everyone spoke English very well & were willing to assist us in any way we needed. Free Internet service in Lobby helped us keep connected to loved ones in the States and was available anytime. So all in all this was a wonderful hotel, affordable and the location was great. It had a nice exercise facility and a rooftop outdoor area for city sights. The room was so well insulated that we never heard a noise during night hours. Made for comfortable sleeping! They are going to start construction accross the hotel for shopping & restaurants so I imagine this location will be in even greater demand in the future. Most everything is a la carte, so bring your Euros, but otherwise you will enjoy this stay.
