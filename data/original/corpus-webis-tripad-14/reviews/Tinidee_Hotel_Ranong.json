Further, the majority of customers are Thais from Bangkok, but this doesn't mean the locals hate Westerners. There are many restaurants serving Western food, and Western beer, a pub which, alright, no Western music, but is fun, more 7-11s than you can shake a stick at, and an airport (recently reopened using AirAsia, not Phuket air as was), and many bus links to and from Bangkok/Phuket.
