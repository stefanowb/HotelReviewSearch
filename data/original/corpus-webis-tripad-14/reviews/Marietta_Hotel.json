We had 2 storey accomodation which did make it difficult with 2 small children as the stairs were marble and also spiral. The room was clean and well maintained. The owners were very welcoming and did everything they could to ensure our holiday was one to remember. The pool was clean and had a small pool for the children, it was a safe area for them to play. There was a small grassed area with a swing which our children used now and then. The bar served snacks and good beer, you can sit and watch the pool in the afternoon with a mythos!! The walk into Skala was along a main road but was never a problem for us - mainly because this \"main\" road was so quiet, typical of the area.

The bed was unfortunately like sleeping on a rock, the only thing that we can really complain about the whole stay. A 5/10min walk would get you to the beach or the town/village quite easily. For those that like dining out this place is packed with restaurants and bars, we found that after trying quite a few of the restaurants we settled on one called \"Siroco\", a nice warm family run place whith exellent home cooked traditional food, Andreas and Karen made you feel very welcome and relaxed.
