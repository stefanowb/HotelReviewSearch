Since local owners purchased it over four years ago, the hotel has undergone remarkable renovations that are still to be completed. The rooms have been fully renovated and they are clean and comfortable. To the new owners' credit, many of the hard working and friendly staff that made staying there always a pleasure remain at the hotel. The restaurants remain some of the best in the area, with Las Hadas bakery a high point of any stay. The breakfast, lunch, & dinner buffets at the Bahia restaurant are very popular with locals for their high quality of food at exceptional value. The fitness center has been converted into a first class gym popular with many locals and American expats. The pool area is an oasis, even during the summer (December to April) when local families send their children for day camp so relaxing by the pool in the mornings can be a challenge because of the noisy children. The hotel is located in a mostly residential area rather than the financial or central parts of the city. This gives the hotel great views, particularly from rooms facing the ocean. We prefer pool and city views because they are more interesting but these rooms can be a bit noisy during weekends when locals come in droves for parties in the hotel. The only negative at this time is that the hotel's renovations make getting in and out of the hotel a challenge and there is only valet parking at this time. However, since traffic in Panama make driving a nightmare, we rent a car only to drive to the beach or the country and rely on plentiful, very cheap, safe, and mostly reliable taxi cabs while in the city.
