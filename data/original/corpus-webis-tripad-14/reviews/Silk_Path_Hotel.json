The room was small but clean and cool and had everything we needed. We appreciated being on the top floor (8) at the back of the hotel so street noise was not a problem at all. The breakfast was outstanding - wide ranging and excellent quality, especially the pastries! The hotel is only a short (and cheap) taxi ride from all the sights of Hanoi and close enough for a cyclo driver to drop you back at your hotel after a ride. The staff at the front desk and door were extremely helpful with good English - all of our questions were answered and great suggestions proffered. We were impressed by the thoughtfulness and honesty of the staff one morning when we left our backpack in the breakfast area - they called our room straight away to advise us of our error.

When we did both the Sapa and Halong Halong Bay trips the hotel were only too happy to hold our bags s we only needed to take a 30ltr Bagpack for the overnight stays, which made life a lot easier in not having to take our large suitcases with us. We we checked in for the 3 nights they,gave us an upgrade to a Suite which was very nice for no extra charge. As others have mentioned all the staff at the Silk Path go out of there way to be friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them. The buffet breakfast has a very good amount of variety and we ate in the restaurant twice and was very impressed with the quality of the food, pricing was also very reasonable for a hotel. The location is great for first time visitors to Hanoi as it is close to the old quarters, the lake and also the train station and also lots of very good restaurants in close proximity to the hotel. would certainly return to the Silk Path when next in Hanoi", "title": "Great Location and Staff are 5 Star", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Sue_Holidays", "date": "October 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142390509}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived around 6 o,clock and it was very busy and was concern where the hotel was but i should,t so.
