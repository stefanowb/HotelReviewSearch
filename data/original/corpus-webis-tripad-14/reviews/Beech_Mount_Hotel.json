He showed us to our double en-suite room and left us there. It took a few minutes for us to register that the room was already festooned with another guest's belongings. We retreated to reception and were shown to a second room. This one was fine but lacked any covering for the window. No room phones meant another trip to reception where on pointing out the lack of window blind we were shown to a third room. A quick look round the door revealed a twin room not the double we required. Back to reception and a fourth room was located and this one was were we stayed. Not a bad room at all. Fresh decor a lavishly illuminated bed featuring 2 wall lights and no fewer than three bedside lights. Beyond the lights the room was cluttered with unnecessary furniture, who needs 2 tall chests of drawers, a nest of tables and an electric fan when there is insufficient floor space to open our suitcase.
