The pool is somewhat small, but we never had a problem finding lounge chairs. The same goes for the beach area, which is just a about a hundred feet down a path from the pool. The restaurant/bar area by the pool had decent food and drinks at reasonable prices, with daily specials. Beach towels are provided free of charge, but must be signed out at the front desk. The free continental breakfast was pretty good, with indoor/outoor seating just off the lobby. We had a studio suite, which is the cheapest room available, and found it to have ample space. there was a small sittting area with a couch and a kitchen area with a coffee maker, toaster, microwave, and fridge.
