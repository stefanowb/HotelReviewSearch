Lovely breakfasts on the terrace with excellent views of the volcano. Lunch on the terrace is an experience. Dinner was equally pleasing. We also tried lunch and dinner at the sister hotel Sant Andrea. The quality of service and food matches the Timeo's. And the ambiance is hard to beat.

Signor Funardi, the GM and his team ensure that each guest have an extraordinary experience at their property. Of course, it is a 5 star hotel -- so if one is on a budget, respectfully, you will probably be more comfortable at another property but do stop by to admire the view at a minimum.
