While Japan gets warm in summer, it certainly isn't the Caribbean. My wife has been to Cancun, Jamaica, and Costa Rica so I think she was maybe a little less fascinated with the whole tropical nature compared to me. We had decided on St. Lucia early on in trying to plan the Honeymoon. We ended up going to Liberty Travel, and the Marigot Bay Hotel was the only place in St. Lucia they had in their catalog, so we went with it. The price was along what we had already been considering. I wouldn't have thought that mid-May would be the off season, but we were surprised to find that nearly no one was around. Not just the hotel we were at- we just didn\u2019t see that many tourists (except for Sandals, which still had buses of people leaving and going to the airport).
