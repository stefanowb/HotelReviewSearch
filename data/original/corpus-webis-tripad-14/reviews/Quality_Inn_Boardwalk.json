We have gone to other places from time to time, but always came back. The oceanfront efficiency rooms are great, plenty of room, always clean, as is the bathroom. The ocean views are breathtaking. Watching dolphins frolic from your room balcony in the morning is a wonderful way to start your day. As for price, I think the rooms are reasonable for a property on the ocean. The Jersey shore and other places are much more expensive during the high season, as are the Rehoboth hotels. And the oceanfront rooms are tiny. The only negative for us has been the restaurant. Very slow service every time we have been there, though the food is okay. I plan to stay here next summer as well.", "title": "Don't Believe the Haters", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "NyVioletcat", "date": "September 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118411674}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "NASTY!!!!.....DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Yes, many of the hotels in OC are older, but many have done updates to stay with the times. The photos on the website are so misleading. First off, our door barley closed which made us feel so safe..(NOT) and of course we had to have a drunk man banging on the door at 2am trying to get in swearing it was his room....great, we have a strong drunk man slamming into the door that is barley closed to begin with!! Then we walked into the room and noticed how old everything was, the couch and chair were falling apart, the two beds didnt even have bedskirts on them, exposing the nasty dirty ripped up boxsprings. When I complained to the front desk, I was told that \"not all rooms come with bedskirts\". Notice that the website does not have photos of the bathroom...thats becasue they are smatter than that. The bathroom has blue tiles from the 1970's and is falling apart. Our stay was middle sept. and a cold front came through. We couldnt get the heat to work so we once again called the front desk...only to be told that \"heat wasnt available this time of year\". I expressed my anger as it was to drop into the 40's that evening and I was told that they could bring me extra blankets...REALLY!!! It's freezing and raining and I cant use the heat!! Indoor pool was not heated! Even the hot tub was just a little hot. Parking is limited to one spot, yet the room holds four people, so I'm sure I'm not the first to want a second spot, which of course I was told that I couldnt get yet it was bike week and there were motorcycles in every inch of the parking lot....on the sidewalks...under the car port which was only to be used for drop off and pick up, so obviously we couldnt even pull our car up to pick up otheres in our party during the rain storms. Toliet paper and tissues are cheap, thin and rough. Tv is from the 1990's and barley works. Good luck getting on the elevators, they work half the time. This was a $200 a nite room that looks like a $79.99 a nite room.

Yes, it is a bit outdated and i do have to agree it is expensive. However, it is clean which is very important to me and the staff is excellent. I have never had any problems and every year we ask for the same room and get it no problem. We did have to stay one time during off season on the 1st floor and yes it was noisy but, we just were as noisy and laughed it off. The convenience of the location of the hotel we also love. We walk or drive our bikes everywhere. We always had good food & good service at the Oceanview and great drinks at the outside bar. I highly recommand.

I stayed only one night and found another hotel. This hotel is very dated (as many of them here are) but it is right on the ocean and if you can get an upper floor room with an ocean view I'm sure it would be ok. I however was supposed to get exactly that and on check in was put on the ground floor \"ocean view\". The ocean was there but on the other side of the fenced in pool that blocked my view. The other problem with ground level here is the noise! Avoid this! I went back to the desk to inquire about a new room and was told there was nothing available but a side smoking room with no view. I took a look and this room was right out of the 60's , including the blue toilet and bath tub. And also no difference in price.
