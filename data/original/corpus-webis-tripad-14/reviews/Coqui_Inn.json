They have phones in the rooms, but you have to leave a deposit at the front desk (which is a block away at the Green Isle Inn) in order to call even the front desk!! The photos on their web-site are nice, but they were not taken at this hotel, at least not in the past 30 years. My bathroom had a \"shower\" in the corner with no curtain or even any sort of ridge to contain the water. I could be taking a shower and pee into the toilet at the same time. By the time I was done with my shower, the entire bathroom was drenched. I was there for 2 days and never found the promised second pool. . .perhaps it was in the middle of the cemetary next door.

I read the reviews and see what's going on. As some reviewers pointed out, if you pay the lowest price, you don't expect the highest quality. I've stayed at a place in Ensenada with no toilet paper or soap. I chose it because in was the cheapest. If I wanted toilet paper, I should have stayed at the place next door and paid $5 more. I've stayed at the Downtown L.A. Bilmore. Got tired of 20 staffers standing around with their hands folded, saying, \"Good Morning, Sir.\" I'm going to do what I've done before. In fact, once I stayed at some gay hotel in Condado, paid the \"gay premium,\" and was up all night, because the thumping of the bass in the disco below prevented us from getting any sleep. In the morning we moved across the street, paid even less, no gay premium, and were quite comfortable among the straight clientele. It's not really a good example, because we went from more expensive to cheaper, but it's an illustration that, unless you do something stupid like prepay the whole stay, you can move. And being there, you can check out some other places in a cluster of hotels like in Condado Beach and Isla Verde. Here's what we're gonna do. By the way, I'm with the same great guy with whom I went to Condado in 1980. San Juan is our honeymoon and second honeymoon choice. We're gonna go to The Mango. Pay for one night. I'm less likely to hate it than the other beer price/champagne taste guests. I know what to expect. It's what I chose. If I decide to pay more, from what I see PLENTY more, we'll spend a couple hours checking out some other places the next morning, and move, probably paying two or three times as much. Since we've got a rental car and will be out all day, maybe we'll be satisfied to sleep there. In our early days we had a tiny apartment, and our parents slept on a wall bed in the living room. We're flexible, not hard to please. If there's no toilet paper, we'll ask for it the Mango Inn. The charm is that you can always move.
