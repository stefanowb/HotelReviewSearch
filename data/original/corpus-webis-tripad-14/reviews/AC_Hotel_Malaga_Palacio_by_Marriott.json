There is a waiting area just out front and you can deposit the car there for 15 mins max before it has to move. We elected to have the porter park the car as the one way system and no parking around the cathedral makes finding spaces awkward. Check-in was easy and the reception staff very pleasant and efficient. Stayed in the hotel for a couple of nights and had a room outside the elevator on the top floor. Always wary about rooms located in such places but it was not too bad and the view out over the promenade was lovely. We did not go for breakfast as the other half doesn't and there are plenty of places around for coffee etc. The room was lovely and clean with a wooden floor and felt spacious, think it might have been recently renovated. The free soft drinks was a nice touch, especially when you . We were really surprised by the prices for drinks in the hotel, they were cheap in comparison to those you find in a lot of good hotels these days. Would recommend you go upstairs to the top floor if you get a chance to look over the city you will get one of the best views over the Cathedral and the city.", "title": "Very central", "user": "Gib_jac", "date": "March 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126756095}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I witnessed the accident on the hotel steps mentioned by lamb04. Certianly the hotel management knew all about it, because the next morning they helped to find a pharmacy, and sent a taxi to buy some crutches for the victim, and helped with phone calls to the insurance company. I am surprised there is no report of it in the hotel books, as by the next day all the staff knew of the fall, and how it happened. Be careful on a Saturday night; as you wont get much attention from the hotel staff. Yes, you can leave your cases in the street, and walk up the stairs and ask for help. Er, isnt there a thing called a porter? Especially in a five star hotel? Otherwise the hotel was good, though the cafeteria was shut for repairs. However, there were lots of good cafes nearby for breakfast. You had to buy a card (12 euros) to have wifi in the room, and the card didnt work; however, the hotel reimbursed me for the card.", "title": "confirm accident on steps story", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "fredaRome", "date": "March 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126752027}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Palacio is a great hotel with many nuances. The most obvious to the stingy British tourist is the free minibar, which we have enjoyed consuming in its entirely on several occasions now; our only only disappointment is that only one of the drinks is alcoholic though the fridge is large enough to accommodate one's own gin and tonic! The bedrooms are large and the bed is easily rotated; this is a great feature since rotating the beds by 90 degrees afford an excellent view out of the hotel window, though as the sun hits the hotel directly in the morning it's important to ensure that any foodstuffs are removed from the sun's harmful rays. The bathroom is a superb feature and the bath can easily accommodate two with some high quality toiletries to relax with therein.
