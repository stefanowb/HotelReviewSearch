The only place that had discent food or drinks wa the bella vista, the pizza was yummy. Forget about asking for assistance on tours or places to go, every time you called the concierge, they never knew anything or told us to call back. We did enjoy our $300 dinner at the strip house, it was delicious. I felt that I never got a good night sleep, there were doors and staff walking by talking on their radios, it was loud all night, and one night the wind was blowing so hard that we had to push the furniture up on the glass to stop the howling or the glass from vibrating!

We made reservations with the front desk on 08/01/2013for two rooms in which the staff member (I do not remember her name) was gladly to assist us in our request and recommend that we stay at the (LAS BRISAS OCEAN VIEW ROOM\u2019s), during our stay for the best views of the islands and ocean. During the reservation process, I asked if all members of my party would receive the complimentary breakfast which encompassed 5 adults and 1 child under the age of 8. The staff member stated \u201cYES\u201d that\u2019s not a problem at all, we would be glad too. That\u2019s when I stated to go ahead and make the reservations for the total amount of $945.77. Upon my arrival, I was met by your front desk supervisor whom which she stated that the rooms will only provide complimentary breakfast for two adults for each room. I then stated that I was told by the staff member that took my reservation that it would accommodate all members of my party. Eva then continually stated in a sarcastic tone of voice \u201cNO IT\u2019S ONLY FOR TWO\u201d adults for each room. I then asked to speak with a member of management, which which the staff memebr when grinned and stated that \u201cwell that\u2019s me\u201d I was taken back somewhat by her unprofessionalism towards me and my family, which was very brash and condescending like in her attitude. Ms. front desk supervisor then kept on assisting that we were given the correct information (in which we were not), and made us feel unwelcomed and as if we were lying to her in order to get the free breakfast. (Trust me it\u2019s not about the money, it was about the principal of the matter), I tried to explain to Ms. front desk supervisor the sequence of events that transpired between the phone conversations with the front desk staff member that who originally had taken our reservation. After having an in-depth conversation for over 25 minutes with Ms. front desk supervisor about this issue, and being completely embarrassed at this point, it was then I asked to speak with the resort manager, Ms. front desk supervisor stated that you were not available. I then asked for your business card. It was at that time Ms.front desk supervisor stated in a condescending tone of voice, \u201cFINE I\u2019ll GRANT you the breakfast for all members of your party, see I\u2019m typing it in now.\u201d I was shocked and utterly amazed on how my family and I were treated. It was then that I requested any and all documentation pertaining to this event that Ms. staff memebr was typing into the computer as evidence of our treatment on your resort, so that I would have the opportunity to discuss this matter with you at a later date. The following day 08/15/2013 at 10:00 am, my family and I went to the El Conquistador Las Brisas for breakfast, were we had another memorable experience, in which we had to wait over 22 minutes for service. If it were not for another member of your service team, which was already waiting on other guests, our wait time would have been longer. I believe her name was (Ms. Yahaira Quinones), she come over and apologized for our long wait time and took our order by pouring us coffee and juice and the rest which we took care ourselves from the buffet. We made sure that we took care of Ms. Quinones with a healthy and generous tip (which was well over $90.00 dollars); just for making sure we were fine. I would hire her for one of my practices, she gets the customer service piece without question, there is an old saying \u201cwithout customers we would not have jobs\u201d. On that same day, around 11:34 am I proceeded to check out which it took over 43 minutes because I had to explain to your staff member at the desk that charged me for the rooms again and the breakfast which I thought the front desk supervisor would have shared the notes that she took and gave me with her team. I had to show my documentation that the front desk supervisor gave me in order to rectify this issue, and not to be charged for the breakfast. In closing I would like to add that I my wife and I travel the world, and have stayed in other distinguished and prestigious resorts, which are well-known for their world renowned customer service. After each encounter with a guest the staff member is trained by saying \u201cit was my pleasure.\u201d I regret to inform you that none of your staff members in closing stated to any member of my party those words, neither did we over hear anyone say this at the El Conquistador Resort / (Waldorf Astoria Resort). This leads me to believe that this is neither part of the El Conquistador Resort / (Waldorf Astoria Resort) culture, nor part of the curriculum at the resort. I attached the documents for your review as well as my contact information. If I do not pick up please leave me a detailed massage as my family and I are still on vacation. Thank you for prompt attention to my concerns, and hopefully you would have the opportunity address your staff members on basics of customer\u2019s service. Within your response, would you be so kind to provide me the names and numbers of the executive staff member\u2019s that over sees the El Conquistador Resort / (Waldorf Astoria Resort).

We went to the casino and the guy there was very nice and went back and got us 3 beers and a pina colada on the house and urged us to complain to the front desk. They ended up giving us an oceanview room so we were pleased. We found the staff to be very, very nice. If I would have paid their normal rate, I might have been a little disappointed in the room.

We decided to go to the casino around 11.30 p.m. for texas holdem limt play . My wife gracelessly asked if I would like to take the only empty seat at the one table they had. I sat down while she put her name on the waiting list for the next seat several others that came in after us also put there name on the waiting list. About 35 minutes went by, be for there was a open seat at the table, a gentleman who had just arrived at the casino took a seat my wife informed the dealer that she had been waiting for the seat for 35 minutes and her name was next on the list. The dealer continued to ignore her and continued to allow the gentleman who afford to give the seat up since there was a waiting list the dealer informed my wife that he would have the seat since he is a man and she could wait.

Apparently, there is a small fishing village you can walk to from the marina where you can experience real Puerto Rican cuisine for cheap prices; we didn't find out until the day we left so we missed out on that. Palomino Island (their private island) is a great place to spend a day, they have tons of water sports and horseback riding, etc. Again, keep in mind the prices. For tours and excursions, I would recommend renting a car for El Yunque Rainforest instead of paying for the tour. I would recommend bringing rain gear and wearing a swimsuit as it WILL rain when you go, and there are these falls which you can swim in. However it is a 35 minute hike from the main trail. For Old San Juan you should go with a tour; we went by ourselves and had no idea where to go. Also, for most of the tours that the hotel organizes, there is a 6-8 person minimum so we missed out on some of them cause there weren't enough people interested in going. If you're going with a group then you're fine but if you're in a smaller group (we were 3) then keep that in mind.

I was repeatedly met with eye rolls and one syllable answers when I aksed various hotel staff for directions or other assistance. I saw a couple of the guys in our group order drinks from the casino waitress. She turned to them and snapped, \"you gonna pay for it? I'm not getting them unless you tell me who's gonna pay for it.\" Even if the drinks were not \"on the house\" because they weren't sitting at a table at the moment, she was ridiculously rude. One couple in our group had their camera stolen from the casino and security seemed as if they couldn't care less. They were told that although the security cameras caught the thief on video, there was nothing that could be done about it. The whole incident seemed fishy. Another person prebooked the shuttle bus back to the airport on her final day, only to arrive and be told that the bus was full and she'd have to wait an hour for the next one. She barely made her flight. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in El Conquistador.
