We were in town for a wedding, and they also allowed us to check in a little after noon rather than the 3:00 check-in time. The room was very clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Our room was very quiet, and you can tell the hotel has a commitment to giving guests a quiet stay, because the staff broke up the wedding after-party going on in one of our friends' room very quickly (as they should have). Our only complaint was that the fire alarm woke us up at 8:00 a.m. Sunday morning, but I would prefer a false alarm to NOT hearing an alarm in a real fire!", "title": "Very nice stay", "user": "Hannah S", "date": "October 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 180873550}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "A bit more expensive than other motels in Rock Falls.
