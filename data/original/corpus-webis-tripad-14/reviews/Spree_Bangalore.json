The first thing i noticed about the hotel was the rooms. The rooms are pretty big. All of them. I though stayed in the club room and then later the executive room. The rooms are just the best in this hotel and price category. Also the service is very good. Sandeep, manager@frontdesk, was very coperative and accomodating and shobha was prompt. Shekhar from the housekeeping did an amazing job as well. Personalized service is what u wud get while here. I must also mention the restaurant staff especially the manager mr. Pradeep. They went out of their way to accomodate our requests. The hotel itself is very comfortable and clean with modern looks.
