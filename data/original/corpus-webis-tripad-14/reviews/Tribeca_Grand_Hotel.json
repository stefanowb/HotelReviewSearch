My town car was always there as it was supposed to be, no delays. Room was beautiful, clean and the bed was super cozy and comfy. My most pleasant surprise was the quality of the food as most hotels offered a very starchy, cooked from frozen menu. Each time I ordered room service I was very pleased. LOVED the organics and the gluten-free offerings! Also LOVED that you have Kiehl's in each room as the toiletries. I LOVE Kiehl's and use it at home! Such a nice treat!

The concierge and staff were friendly and helpful, and the service was good. My room was a decent size, and although it was a bit noisy, this is due to the design of the hotel, around an atrium that runs floor to ceiling, so not much that can be done about it. It's well laid out and the design is modern with a bit of character to it, definitely not like being in a faceless corporate hotel. I felt comfortable having a quiet glass of wine on my own in the bar on my return from work, and overall I would recommend it.
