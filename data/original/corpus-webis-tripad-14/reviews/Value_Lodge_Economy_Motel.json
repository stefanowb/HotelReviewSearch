I was lured in by the sign outside - $50 per room. I guess I shouldn't expect much from a price so low, but I sure didn't expect this. My non-smoking room smelled like an ashtray and there were cigarette burns all over the carpet. The TV didn't work. There was no door on the bathroom. But, worst of all, there were lots of unsavorly looking people staying there.", "title": "A Real Dive", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Tomcod", "date": "October 16, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4027430}], "location": {"country": "Canada"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 3, "terrible": 10, "excellent": 1}, "aka": "Value Lodge Economy Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667, "description": "Value Lodge Motel is under new management since December of 2009.
