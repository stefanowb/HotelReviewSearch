First of all, the rooms are wayyyy too small for what you pay. Our room was on the third floor and the shower was on the second floor. Granted we had a half bath in our room however we had to trek down a flight of stairs, that were not private, to shower. The bed in our room was obviously old and did not fit the bed frame well and it was lopsided and practically falling off. Our \"breakfast\" was only a choice of three options (french toast, scrambled eggs, or oatmeal) that were given verbally by the waiter (no menu). The breakfast food was ok--I'm sure we could have gotten better food elsewhere on the island. There is also no \"common\" area for guests to relax or hang out. There is a \"sitting room\" which is basically a hallway that they stuffed a couch into. We were basically ignored our entire stay there--while I realize that their main business is the restaurant it would be nice if they took more of an interest in their guests--especially since it's NOT a cheap place to stay!", "title": "Not the best", "user": "zero523", "date": "July 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 17955463, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 We were ignored the entire trip!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The Gables...top notch everything", "text": "The location IS great though--and you can get beach chairs and badges which was nice.
