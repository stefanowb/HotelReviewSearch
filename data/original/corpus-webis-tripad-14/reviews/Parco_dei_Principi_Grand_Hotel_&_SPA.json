This hotel claims to be a 5 star, but could not even be considered a 1 star compared to what we are used to staying in. When we inquired as to why the pictures on their web site looked nothing like the rooms or the hotel, Marco at the front desk actually told us they sometimes use other hotel\u2019s pictures on their web site. We were shocked! When we asked why they took the reservation but couldn\u2019t hold the reservation, they told us they weren\u2019t obligated to hold a room for us even though we had a confirmation number and numerous emails from them confirming our stay. We tried explaining the concept of taking a reservation vs. holding the reservation to no avail. When we asked if we could sit in the lobby and try to find a hotel to stay in they said only if we paid them 25 Euros for wifi, even though it was their fault we had no place to stay for our vacation. We had to stay one night at this disgusting hotel but we eventually found a fabulous resort, the Gran Melia in Rome, and spent our vacation in a resort that was actually a 5 star resort with a beautiful infinity pool and views of Rome. We ended up paying twice as much because of the late booking but it was worth it to stay in a hotel that was clean and beautiful. SAVE YOUR VACATION!

The waiting staff were excellent, and although it was not a full al la carte menu, the choice was very good, well presented and very good to eat.
