Location close to the conference and being a known brand made me prefer this, though it is more expensive than other local brands and as I realized later, better hotels. I presume the hotel is located in a \"happening\" place in Bangkok - there are milling crowds, huge malls, many street vendors and eating joints all around the hotel. The hotel building looks in good shape - but this is one of those where one enters the building only to reach a different floor where the lobby is located. Lobby itself is funky and has great views of Bangkok skyline. Room is basic but reasonably spaced and modern and quite utilitarian - enough plug-points of all types at all convenient locations. Breakfast spread is good and the restaurant is spacious. The staff in the hotel were quite efficient and polite. The attitude of the concierge, though was quite surprising - when asked to hail a cab for the airport, they couldn't and were also unable to \"persuade\" the 10+ cabs that dropped of guests to take us to the Airport, They gave up after about 20min of \"effort\" and went back into the hotel, leaving us to step on to the road and do it ourselves - the baggage unattended at the entrance. May be it is a problem in the whole of Bangkok, but in which case I would have liked a hotel like Novotel to atleast prepare the overseas guests in advance.

They were having difficulty locating our reservation (a first for me since using Cathay Pacific Holidays many times in different hotels). Also, not a lot of sitting areas in the lobby, so guests waiting to check in may have to stand around and wait. we arrived around noon and our rooms were not ready so we had to come back later. But when we came back in the evening, as we were handed the room keys, they told us our luggages will be brought up shortly. After waiting for 15 mins, we made a call and they told us they couldn't find our bags??? So we had to go down to lobby again to sort this out. It took them another 15 mins to get our luggages to us.
