The room was small, but had everything we needed - including an inward facing room not on the main road. The roof top terrace is quite lovely with good views of the acropolis, though the restaurant there is quite pricey. Magna Grecia is a short walk from two main metro stations, which is a real selling point of this place, as well as the location in a lovely part of historic Athens. The service here is also great - we left early in the morning before the buffet breakfast opened and the hotel staff packed us a very filling breakfast.

There were no windows, the room was tiny, the bathroom old and worn and - worst of all - this jailhouse was stinking intensively of old smoke. We immediately asked for another room, but due to the receptionist there was no other available. They offered us to give us the money back - and we could go ahead an look for another hotel. As we only had one evening in town we did not think this as an option for us - BIG MISTAKE! I did not sleep a second due to the smoked filled air, the stinking blankets and cusions.

Breakfast was great, thanks to the sweet hostess in charge, and we enjoyed picnic suppers several evenings enjoying the lights on the Parthenon after dark.
