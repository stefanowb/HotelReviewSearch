The rooms were spacious (we had a family room and a connecting room), it was very clean and well serviced by cleaning staff over the christmas and new year period. In addition, the breakfast is varied and of good value, it has a nice gym and a nice outdoor pool (the smaller one is heated). The beds were very comfortable. I hardly noticed anything from falling asleep to waking up. The shower is great and the bathroom is well stocked with towels and bath products. It has free wifi and the business center has free internet and a heavy duty printer. You don't have a lot of staff assistance for minor things like carrying your luggage and the domestic staff are sometimes too overly keen to clean your room, but for the price , and even if it was more expensive, it is definitely worth it, and we had a fantastic stay. We were able to use their bathroom scales to weigh our luggage and the location is also very good for most places from downtown to the airport.", "title": "Fantastic - My new best place to stay in Houston", "user": "DaSaint", "date": "January 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 52786695}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel was fantastic.
