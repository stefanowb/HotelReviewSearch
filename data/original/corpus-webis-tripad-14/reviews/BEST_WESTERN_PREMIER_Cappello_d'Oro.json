Thank goodness for sat. nav., as after a long 5 hour journey and 33 degree heat, you can easily get lost trying to find the hotel. I agree with the comments before about the hotel car parking... the porter was supposed to be guiding my husband back into a miniature garage (and we have a small sports car) and through bad instructions managed to cause a scrape on the body of our car above the back wheel. I argued with the manager on this issue and he knocked off one night's parking fee (very generous!). They did move us to the secure parking area just four shops down from the hotel, so ask for this if you can as it's much easier and closer to the hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CharliesGirl", "date": "July 8, 2006", "id": 5438867}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "We paid in advance for a deluxe king-size bedroom (their early bird offer) and got the room for \u00a383 per night, incl. breakfast.
