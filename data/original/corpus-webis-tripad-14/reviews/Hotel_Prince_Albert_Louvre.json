One person can hardly walk into the bathroom and the whole room is flooded when you shower. The internet does not work. On top of these, the hotel staff are also terrible. On the third day of my stay my room was not even cleaned. I left early in the morning for some sightseeing and came back to the hotel in the evening hours to see that the room was not cleaned and the bathroom was still flooded. The receptionist said that it was not his problem! When I checked out early after all of these, the receptionist charged me for one full day for a room that they had not even bothered to clean!
