From working in Louisville over the last two years I have discovered that there are many great attributes about staying at the Seelbach Hilton Louisville. The best attribute about the Seelbach Hilton Louisville is the location. The Seelbach Hilton Louisville is located downtown next to Fourth Street live and many good restaurants and bars. I have stayed at the Seelbach Hilton Louisville a few times but never dinned at the hotel itself. The hotel does have a restaurant but there are better restaurants within walking distance. When staying at the Seelbach Hilton Louisville you has easy access to a great Starbucks coffee franchise and world class bourbon bar. I find the bourbon bar at the Seelbach Hilton Louisville to be boring but they have an amazing selection of bourbons that will not find anywhere else.", "title": "Great business hotel located downtown Louisville", "user": "mdditt2000", "date": "October 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144033461}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel has a long history has been frequented by many notable Americans for instance F.

The staff behind the counter always seem to very friendly and accommodating. Hilton honors status at the Seelbach Hilton Louisville plays a huge role to getting a better room or upgrade. Since I only have blue Hilton status I normally receive a room on the second floor. However the room was very quiet and bed was extremely comfortable. My colleague with Diamond Hilton status always receives an upgrade or better room on a higher floor. He also receives access to the Hilton lounge where they provide snacks, breakfast and drinks. The in-room coffee, soap, shampoos are excellent. What I like best about the Seelbach Hilton Louisville is the easy access to parking at the back for the hotel.

With this package we were immediately upgraded to a beautiful 1 bedroom suite on the 6th floor. The room was very large and exceptionally clean, with a separate living room and large bedroom with king bed. As other reviewers have noted, the bathrooms are small, but very nice, and this is a very old hotel that has worked hard to successfully maintain its rich, historical feel. Our room rate included breakfast each morning (either through room service or at their cafe in the lobby), and we opted for breakfast each morning in our room. Particularly good is the Capriole Farm goat cheese egg scramble, and the cheese grits. We also ordered room service for dinner several nights. Room service food was delivered hot and delicious. At check-in, we requested the concierge floor, but no suites were available. However, we were given complimentary access to the concierge floor, which was very nice. With the romance package we also enjoyed a complimentary bottle of champagne, which was in the room when we arrived, chilled and very tasty after a long drive! We also requested a fridge for the room, which was delivered within minutes. The box at the lower part of the door to your room is to leave your shoes in if you want them shined. Took me a minute to figure it out until I looked inside! We enjoyed drinks and appetizers in the Old Seelbach bar located in the lobby several nights, and were free to explore on our own the entire hotel, including the Rathskeller room, which is incredibly beautiful. There is no pool or spa on site. Overall a first rate experience in this historic, national treasure!
