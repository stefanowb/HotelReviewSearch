After reading the reviews here, I expected a much less nice room and was pleasantly surprised to find a lovely room with beautiful tiled floors, a nice kitchenette, and a nice balcony with a great view of the ocean. l admit that I don't live in a new house with the luxuries that Americans seem to expect today in their homes, so I may be unusual in my standards, but we were more than comfortable in our room...we loved it. And right outside we had a great beach with convenient snorkeling any time we wanted, a pool that was both elegant and kid friendly, and drink and food service (breakfast and lunch) on a shaded patio with a full view of the beach, so the adults could relax while the kids played in the water. In addition, we appreciated the convenience of the planned activities the hotel offered -- including the fabulous snorkeling with Peter-- and the friendly and helpful on-site watersport business run by Duane and Michele. And any time we wanted we could jump on the ferry and cross the harbor to Christensted to shop, eat, or just wander around to view the great historic buildings. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this hotel, especially to families with kids.", "title": "Better than I expected", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "misoMaryland", "date": "March 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 14661393, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location", "disliked": "\u2014 Wish restaurant was open for dinner"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Place for the Price", "text": "As others have mentioned, the rooms were a bit dated, but who needs an extremely nice room when you are in paradise?", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Fisher111", "date": "March 15, 2008", "id": 14308664}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled with family", "text": "St. Croix was simply an amazing time.

The shutters on the entry door were broken, half of the kitchen supplies were missing, the mattresses appeared to be from the 1970's, and we couldn't get the tub to drain. Towels for the beach had to be exchanged at the Front Desk. We had the same towels for 3 days - the desk just told us every time-\"maybe tomorrow we will have towels\". Service at the beach restaurant was non-existent. Unless you are a local (which they had plenty of) forget about getting served. They even shipped 30 local kids in one day for lunch.

This hotel is not the Ritz but it served its purpose for me. First the location is perfect. You are in the heart/hrtbor of Christiansted and you are the only hotel that has a beach (in downtown). The ferry was perfect and runs every 10 mins until midnight and once across the water you can walk, shop, drive etc. Some of the families had children with them but I think that you really need to be a water fanactict to truly enjoy the experience. Food is expensive but good but alcohol which is duty free is dirt cheap. Prices for jewerly can be quite a bit so you may want to shop around before buying those pieces that you can not leave the island without such as the hook bracelet. Also while there be sure to take the island tour with Sweeney - it was a great experience and he can also provide insights to other activities on the island. I plan to return very soon and if I stay for 7 days i will stay at he cay once again. If you decide to stay at another location not located by the harbor/boardwalk you will spend quite a pretty penny in taxis.Overall the hotel is a great value for the location.

When I plan vacations, I expect security, quiet atmosphere, cleanliness, friendly and efficient staff and great location. I found it all at HotC and plan on returning. Highlights of hotel: before my visit the staff was very quick to respond to my e-mails as to what was included in our room (I felt like I was very familiar with the hotel accommodations, and what I needed to take, before I even arrived!), easy internet arrangement (through the hotel) of airport pick-up with local, professional and friendly taxi service. Rudi was waiting for our \"delayed\" arrival and even provided a mini tour of STX as we traveled to hotel, check-in was quick and efficient, safe deposit box is in lobby, beach towels available and plentiful, our 3rd floor efficiency was like living in a tree top home with a gorgeous view of the harbour and the active wildlife, ice machine on each floor, Sunday's informative Weekly Activity review is well worth attending as is Supermarket run that took only an hour at $7 rd. trip/person. Snorkeling around the island was great, especially under the dock, sand is like sifted flour and beach was never crowded, beach chairs and loungers were comfortable, water taxi runs continuously during the day and if you're very fortunate, Freddie will share his garden delights and good conversation, Tuesday night Caribbean buffet was fun, great hotel for accessing Christiansted restaurants, shops, water activities and history and the friendliest people I've ever met. We didn't need to rent a car. We didn't access the hotel's water sports shop but it looked well stocked. I'm not interested in the bar nightlife but it was available just a 90 second boat ride away. Check-out was a breeze, our return trip to airport was arranged by hotel staff and the taxi driver was on time and again shared a wealth of information about STX.
