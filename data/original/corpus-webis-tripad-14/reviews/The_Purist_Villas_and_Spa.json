It is in an extremely remote location so you feel isolated and a shuttle runs twice a day. The dirt path, wild dogs, and baking sun do not make it for a pleasant 30 minute walk into town. Oh yes there is also a chained monkey at a nearby house temple. In the hotel, on the other hand, you are exposed- rooms are easily viewed/accessed with little privacy. Some are very noisy due to children by the pool, construction, and neighboring cock fighting farm. My MAIN COMPLAINT though, is the situation that happened when we first arrived. We were told that there was work being done in our villa and that we were being moved to an equivalent one. When asked to see our villa, we were told it was \u201cdusty\u201d. The equivalent one was not a villa but a room with no private outdoor space, very little light, etc. When we met the hotel owner he confirmed that work was being done, no apologies. I then peaked into the villa we were supposed to have and noticed clothing. Then I confronted the manager he admitted that there were people still staying there. They allowed us to stay later the day we were leaving so I am very grateful for that but even with that there was a lot of confusion and lack of communication, mainly on the part on the manager. Aside from all this though, the hotel is just not run affectively. There is either a lack of management or oversight or possibly a lack of money- maybe all three. A lot of \u201cfibbing\u201d that is easily caught, a lot of miscommunication and misrepresentation.", "title": "Family Stay at The Purist Ubud Sep 2011", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JenTran", "date": "October 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 118810182}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "It took me ages to pick where we were going to stay in Ubud (so many of the hotels have fantastic reviews!) but I am SO happy that we ended up at the Purist.

The service was flawless and the staff went out of their way to help organise a cycling tour and a cooking class for us.

Fantastic. The breakfast was the best we had in Bali and we had it served by our pool each morning. We also enjoyed a massage and body scrub in the spa, which left my husband's skin the softest it has ever been.

When we arrived we were offered our choice of our original booking or an upgraded villa - the jungle villa - an upgrade we gladly accepted due to the increased privacy it provided. Though a little dark, and in need of a more thorough dusting throughout, the facilities and decor of the villa were fantastic. The staff all spoke english well and treated us like family, and genuinely seemed to wish to provide us with excellent service and respect. They were also very happy to assist when I fell ill with the dreaded \"Bali belly\" and did all they could to make the experience less painful. We felt so lucky that we mostly had the the main pool all to ourselves, as everyone else seemed to use private pools attached to their villas. The way the Purist is designed, you really feel like you could have the whole place to yourselves even though we knew from our trips on the free shuttle into town that there a few other couples there. A negative aspect of our stay was the construction noise coming from the property next door, and some irrigation work occurring at the Purist outside our villa, but the noise was only a minor inconvenience to us. A much greater source of annoyance was the competitiveness occurring between the different drivers who work for the villa. Each of them would question what we were doing, when, and which driver was taking us, to try and obtain our business. Madi was our favourite driver, as he was a happy go lucky fella who showed us all the sights along the way. We enjoyed our food at the villa, even if it was somewhat basic. The chef obviously puts a lot of effort into obtaining fresh produce everyday and in his presentation of the food. Our spa treatments were also wonderful and very easy to organise.

This place is fabulous in every respect, from service, to the spa, to the villas, to the advice provided. We arrived very late and were promptly picked up by our driver, taken to the hotel and efficiently checked in. Our room, the Hill Villa, was beautiful, secluded and at somewhere around 300sq.m in size, large enough for many more than the two of us. As our stay evolved, the daily suggestions on restaruants, assistance with reservations, and coordination of drivers made it that much better. I think the best compliment though is to their General Manager, whom upon our notice of departure to other parts, indicated that while he looks forward to our return, would also be pleased to assist us in hotel and travel advice for any other Indonesian destination. While there is NO OTHER PLACE to conisder when travelling to Ubud, there is no greater compliment that can be said to any hotel than the ability of its staff to provide service when they may not be the direct beneficiary.

Our chefs use the freshest of ingredients, locally produced and in season, whether your meal is served in your villa or in the restaurant. In its rural and tropical setting you can fully appreciate the tranquil peacefulness the Balinese are famous for. The beautiful surrounding rice paddy fields make the short walk to the centre of Ubud a scenic walk. Being the cultural and spiritual heart of Bali, it is obvious why Ubud is a haven for writers and artists from around the world. The secluded Purist compound includes a spa building used for the specialist Ayurvedic massages as well as a yoga and meditation deck. We offer a variety of treatments, given by the best massage therapists, yoga and meditation teachers. The construction and design of The Purist reflects the ancient Balinese Hindu belief embracing the importance of balance, purity of spirit and harmony, as well as a deep respect for the natural environment. We use an eclectic palette of materials, including recycled wood, authentic Indonesian artifacts, natural lava and lime stone and green river stones. With The Purist, Yvonne and Alberto succeeded in creating yet another home away from home, which has become their trademark signature. The Purist offers only seven private villas, making it the smallest boutique hotel in Bali. In this way, we can meet any of your personal and specific needs. The Purist: sophisticated hospitality stripped to the essence."}
