Nicely-appointed rooms, lovely courtyard with water fountain that helped diffuse the city noise. Free bottled water in our rooms. Shuttle to Pier 91 was $7 pp. Highly recommend.

My first two day stay was excellent. Check in was quick, my room was clean and room service was quick and tasty. It is a couple of miles from what I would consider downtown with the market, lots of shopping and good food. Not many diner recommendations around the hotel. I checked out of the hotel to travel to another city and rechecked in. When I rechecked in I asked if they had transportation to downtown to the market, etc. They stated no and that they only had tranportation to the airport and that was their exact words. I don't know about you but the words, \"we only have transportation to the airport\" makes me believe it is supplied by the hotel. I showed up in the hotel lobby at 4:30 am and a town car was waiting for me. I quickly realized that the hotel didn't have transportation but they called me a towncar. I get in the car and realize the town car service doesn't take a credit card. I rarely carry cash but thankfully had $60 bucks on me. It think it was very misleading for the hotel to claim they have transporation to the airport. In most hotels I have stayed at for business they state they can call a cab or a town car and let me know the amount and if they take credit card ect. It ended fine because my company will reimburse me for this expense. But if I was there with my family and we were on a budget I would have been very unhappy.", "title": "Pleasant stay with one complaint", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Ustravelgirl13", "date": "May 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 130676280}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We spent six nights here this month and found the staff incredibly helpful!

Upon our return, we stayed an additional three nights and were not disappointed. The customer service at the front desk is outstanding, particularly the service and help we received from Nikki. She answered our questions about the area, gave great tips on attractions, and arranged for us to even check in earlier than planned. The hotel is relatively new and well appointed. The room was large and very comfortable, with a great bed. Parking in Seattle is a nightmare and extremely expensive, but the hotel's parking rate was half that of their neighbors. Parking is very safe, in an underground secured parking garage. The hotel operates a \"fireside cafe\" downstairs with reasonable prices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Room service is also available, as is a guest laundry. The only downside was no spa or pool, which would have been welcomed after a long day of walking and sightseeing.
