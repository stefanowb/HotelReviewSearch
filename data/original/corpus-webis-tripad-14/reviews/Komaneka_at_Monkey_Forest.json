First the hotel is right in the thick of downtown Ubud. Walking outside you can pick from tons of restaurants and shops. But as you walk into the Komaneka (which is secluded back off Monkey Forest Road) it seems as though you are walking into the countryside. There is NO noise at all and the gardens and surroundings are luch and inviting. It is the best of both worlds (city variety and country charm). The hotel itself is wonderful. It has the BEST service of any place I have ever stayed. The concierge knows you by name as soon as you check in and helps you with your every need (and greets you every time you come back). The rooms are great with a HUGE sunken tub (for two!), rainforest shower, very comfy beds and nice touches (like turndown service with Komaneka nightgowns). The complimentary afternoon tea is a treat with local sweets next to the infinity pool. The breakfast was great with a choice of eggs/omlette/pancakes/muesli/pastry basket/fresh fruit juices - as much as you'd like. I would highly recommend this place and at $140/night with breakfast it was a steal.", "title": "Every time I close my eyes I can se Ubud", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ozipozi", "date": "August 22, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19221590}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I really think that everything I write is poor comparing to how I felt and how I still feel when I think about our stay at Komaneka in Ubud.", "title": "Serene Komaneka", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "picturesque08", "date": "August 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 19007085}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Traycos", "title": "Pleasurably unforgetable", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TRAYCOS", "date": "August 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 18874684, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location", "disliked": "\u2014 cold plunge pool"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Perth, Australia", "title": "Disappointing!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "p0rtia", "date": "August 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 18735532}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I spent a long time researching where we wanted to spend our time in Ubud, finally settling on this hotel mainly because of the excellent travel reviews and the location.", "title": "A Pampered Experience", "user": "robfQld", "date": "July 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 18481927, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything, all the little extra touches including afternoon tea"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "On arrival we were not at all disappointed as after a long days travel it was a lovely touch to be offered a fresh juice and sented towel to wipe our faces/ hands.", "title": "Sheer luxury.

We were impressed as soon as we got off the coach. The entrance to the lobby was stunning very open and welcoming feeling. The staff were very friendly and efficient. We were offered a seat a wet towel and a welcome drink which was very refreshing. After doing the paper work for checking in we were escorted to our room and the layout of the resort was explained to us. The grounds were immaculate not a leaf out of place. We were shown to our room which is very private almost like a villa, it was stunning. The love heart flower arrangement on the bed was so fantastic that we didn\u2019t want to remove it. We were than shown the room layout where the light switches were, the complimentary water, biscuits and fruit. The room had a great bath (including bubble bath) which after a long flight we took advantage of. It would have been around 9.30 10pm and we were still able to order room service and the food not to badly priced. We had a few massages as well and by staying 5 nights we actually had a complimentary 60 minute massage per person heaven. The location is great walking distance the Monkey forest as well as restaurants right outside our door. The only thing that was average was the breakfast but with restaurants almost open 24 hours who is to complain. Nothing could be faulted at the wonderful place.
