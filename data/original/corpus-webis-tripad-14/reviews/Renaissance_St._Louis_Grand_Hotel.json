This city will be a beautiful city in 5 years or so.. lots of construction going on. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially for a 918 room hotel. They were at capacity that weekend and being that I used to manage hotels they did a great job. We were able to check in at 11am instead of 4pm which allowed us to start site seeing right away. The room was clean and comfy. The bathroom was clean with plenty of towels. We were on the 12th floor and it was very quiet for being at capacity. Ate buffet breakfast downstairs.. typical buffet.

We called housekeeping and a maid took care of the problem. When we returned after the maid had finished, the entire hallway reeked of cheap cleaning spray. As we opened the door to our room, a giant gust of noxious spray filled our nostrils and choked us until the odor finally dissipated. The carpet looked clean though; however after walking on the carpet in my brand-new, bright white socks the bottoms were soon blackened and sooty. Examining one of the beds, I noticed how the mattress was bent in a distinctive U shape.

While the room was clean and in good shape, it was oddly shaped. The bathroom was enormous, and while that sounds like a good thing, it actually was strange and the size unnecessary. The bed was comfortable. We also used the pool and the whirlpool, both of which were okay. We had the romance package, so champagne and strawberries were delivered to our door. It was pleasant, but not worth the extra you pay for it. My favorite part about our stay was the breakfast. It really is delicious - anything you could wish for. You can create your own omelet, as well. Parking was supposed to be free with our package, but they ended up charging us for it. My husband had to call and get them to refund us the $40 (which they readily did). Looking back, I don't think our experience at the Grand was worth what we paid for it.
