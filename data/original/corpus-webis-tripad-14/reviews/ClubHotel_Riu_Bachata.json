As both of us were ill we ended up bed ridden for two days with nothing but water which didn\u2019t stay inside for very long. On the Monday we managed to drag ourselves to see the Thomson rep, who took our details along with that of other guests who were ill and we were advised to go to the doctors where we encountered a 3 hour wait! At this point we realised this wasn\u2019t just the usual stomach upset but something more serious due to the sheer volume of people in the surgery with the same symptoms. The doctor informed us that we had a form of gastroenteritis and extremely dehydrated. We were given two types of tablets, one being antibiotics and sent directly back to our room to await a visit from the nurse whereby we both received an intravenous drip and were given numerous injections. The nurse seemed all too familiar with this situation, as soon as she entered the room she removed the lampshades of the bedside lamps so she had somewhere to suspend the drip from. Thomson claimed that it was a flu effecting the hotel and were extremley reluctant to take matters seriously therefore it took guests demanding further information before they arranged a meeting (which was not made public so not all guests were aware) to discuss the problem at hand. Since returning to the UK we have seen our own doctor who agrees with the findings from the Dominican doctor and we are awaiting results from further tests.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 5, 2006", "id": 5429761}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "Wow, by reading all the previous reviews from early June, I'm glad I waited until the \"virus\" took a vacation somewhere else!

We are both 21 years old and it was my boyfriends first trip and it was my one of many, and it was by far the best. When we first got the airport many workers were there to help us get onto the right bus. We were told that the ride was going to be long but it went by so quick. Our bus ran out of gas... but we didn't' see this as a bad thing because we got to get off the bus and go outside to view the ocean and meet new people. A new bus came shortly to pick us up and we were back on the road in 20 mins. When we got to the resort we were greeted with cocktails and friendly people. We had to wait about 30mins for our room to be ready but that didn't matter because we were to excited to go to the room because we wanted to scope out the resort. I'm pretty sure our mouths were open the whole time we were walking around. Everything was green and colorful, very well kept. We got our keys and went to our room where are mouths stayed open because the room was huge and we didn't even have a jr suit... it was just a regular room. Our view was of the tennis court which was cool so we can see when it was empty to go play and everything was SOOOO CLEAN! I hadn't slept for months before the trip for some reason but when we got there I slept every night like a baby! I'm always cold so i slept with and extra blanket but my boyfriend had the air conditioner on which made the room very cold and comfortable. If we had any questions we would call downstairs and they would have not problem helping us. We bought a calling card for $20 which gave us contact to Canada for our week stay. The first day we just ate, looked around some more and watched the entertainment which made us laugh soooo hard. I do not know how they have so much energy. They dance so fast and they get the crowd going. The next morning was orientation where you find out info about excursions and fun facts. As soon as that was done we went to book a bunch of trips. OCEAN WORLD is a must go. That was definitely the highlight of our trip. Dancing, feeding, and taking pictures with dolphins, playing and kissing sea lions, snorkeling in a huge coral tank, being in a bird cage with at least 20 on you. Just an amazing adventure. We also went to paradise island which is breath taking and full day of fun and relaxation. Snorkeling is at both of those excursions. We heard a lot of bad reviews about the locals coming in on the weekends but we didn't notice any and planned out excursions on the weekend so that we wouldn't have to be around the resort incase it was as bad as people made it out to be. But when we were back for dinner we didn't notice any difference. On the third day my boyfriend got a bad sun rash which had nothing to do with the resort but just to let you know that the doctors on the resort are amazing. We went in and in 20min they took out insurance info and gave him IV and he was fine for the rest of the trip. While laying on the beach we were approached by a worker to go on some other excursions. We both wanted to go horseback riding so we bargained with the guy and went for $25 each which was cheap for a 4hr ride and later they took us to hold snakes and tarantulas and there was a little souvenirs shop there too. Food was really good. I was scared of getting sick but we ate everything and we were fine. We were there for valentines day and my boyfriend paid $20 and when we got to our room after dinner there was a huge arrangement of flowers and rose pedals on the floor and bed and balloons on our door and inside the room. It was so cute and i loved it. No one else had it so we felt special. If you make friends with the works they go far out of their way to help you out and make your trip more than amazing. As for cleaning the room... we had no problems with this missing and everything was cleaned nicely and our fridge was always full of drinking water and beer and pops. I don't know how anyone can have a bad time here because it was the best trip o have ever been on and the people there are amazing and uplifting. I can't wait till the day i go back. I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone....", "title": "couldn't ask for a better trip to paradise!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "baby_matta", "date": "August 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38043757}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I just returned from the dominican republic and stayed at the riu bachata 4 days and 3 nights and I will not return.

Took unwell at the resort and ended up in hospital on my return!!!!!! I will start at the beginning..... The views from the bus from the airport were amazing....guys on motorbikes carrying machine guns, drivers drinking from open bottles of beer! Then it got better, on exiting the bus we were met by an american woman informing us she had had her room broken into and all of her money taken! YES, it got worse.....the rooms were far from 5*, they were basic, damp smell, aircon was non existent, mould on bath tiles (lovely, I hear you say!) the so called 2 double beds were small and hard, the pillows were so flat we used towels to boost them up. I had to ask the cleaner to change our beds after a week!. Also if you have booked, ensure you hide your toiletries every day, as this is the cleaning products used by the cleaner! In fact hide anything that can be moved as the cleaner believes if it is left lying on in the room, ITS HERS! this includes money. Okay,now the food, if you like banana, you are fine...they use it in everything.....it is the same food repeated daily and both the italian and steak restuarant gave us all upset tummies!!! The entertainment for kids is easy to describe...THERE IS NONE!!!! The rest of the entertainment isn't much better. Oh, this is the best bit.....Friday-Monday they give free holidays to local residents, at first you think its sweet...thats until they are taking your inflatables, jumping on your head in the pool and you are not getting served at the food or drink bars because the staff give them as a priority...bet your glad you spent so much on your holiday now!!!! All I can say as no matter how many reviews are good.....can you take the chance!!!!!! PS. every two week you are asked to review staff, this is an interesting day.....the staff do everything but kiss your bum.....cause if they don't get named as being good...THEY GET SACKED THE FOLLOWING DAY!!!!", "title": "'PLEASE DON'T GO!!!'", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Salen3", "date": "August 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 37657701}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed at RIU Bachata 7/31 thru 8/7/09. Had two ocean view rooms, one for my husband and myself and one for our 17 year-old son. The rooms were okay in design...the beds were very hard/firm and the pillows were like laying your head on a sandbag. The \"air conditioning\" was next to non-existent, unless you count the ceiling fan as the air conditioning. I had read other reviews of a musty odor/smell in the rooms, but neither of our rooms had a smell or odor (thank goodness!). The grounds of the resort were kept immaculate throughout our stay. The beach was wonderful. The Dominicans are very kind people...you hardly pass one without them looking directly at you and saying \"hola\". The food was okay, but it was the same thing day after day after day. I was tired of the food by the 3rd day. Can't imagine what people who stay there two weeks at a time do! We thought we'd try something different one evening and tried to have dinner at the restaurant at the RIU Merengue, but they wouldn't let us in....said we were supposed to be at Bachata. We were under the impression we could use the restaurants and amenities of all three resorts, but apparently not? I was very adamant about not drinking the faucet water, washing my hands frequently, and using the hand sanitizer, but I still got some sort of stomach bug. Purchased some Immodium from the \"Farmacia\" (10 pills for $15) and took those. It would have been nice to have the fridge re-stocked daily. They supposedly re-stock the fridge every other day, but it wasn't even that often. Also thought internet should have been included in the price. Not only do you have to pay $8/hour for it, but the only place it is available is in the lobby.
