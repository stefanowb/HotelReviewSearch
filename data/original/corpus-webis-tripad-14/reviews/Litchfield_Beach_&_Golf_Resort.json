I waited 10 days to calm down as I was sorely disappointed and upset in the accommodations we were given. I scoured the internet for a nice place to stay and selected what I thought would be a nice place to stay. Unfortunately, my experience will speak for itself. When I called the resort directly to make the reservation, the agent assured me the room would be a certain floor plan with very nice furnishings. When we arrived on 8/2/08, the room was not the floor plan we chose from the internet and furnishings were in poor shape, the mattresses were in need of replacement, the room did not smell clean. Later in the evening when the first shower was taken, the shower did not drain properly and I called maintenance to fix it. When the second person showered, the shower did not drain properly. This scenario went on for days. I called and complained again. On the last night of our stay, a very nice staff member offered to put us in another room. We left some of our belongings in the original room, so on the morning of our departure at 6AM ET, I went to retrieve our belongings and found the room was flooded from the shower/bathtub drainage problem with \"dirty\" water streaming over the tub into the kitchen and front room. I can't express how annoyed and upset I was with this resort. I want to comment about the staff at the resort to say they must have been trained to empathize but have no power to change anything wrong.

The TV was small, old and did not have HBO, Demand or anything other than local channels. For a resort this is most unusual and definately disappointing. The kitchen/dining area were fine and the bath very nice. I don't care what the price, while it was reasonable since it was off season and the ecomy is bad, the place needs to be comfortable and it wasn't. Also, the indoor pool and facilities (a necessity during the cooler weather) was small and outdated. The pool depth was shown as 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 feet, but the water was at least a foot below the water line with no one in the pool. The photo of the indoor pool area is most deceptive.

Pictures looked great on the website. We rented a 2 bedroom duplex for 5 nights. We were told by the staff it was a 2 bedroom house not a duplex you share with another set of renters with paper thin walls. I'm sure they were just as happy as we were! If you like mold, roaches, spiders, and fire ants this is the place for you. It severly needs a renovation. The furniture, curtains, and bedspreads looked like they were new in the 80's. Not to mention the mattress. None of the remotes had batteries and the DVD player in the second bedroom was broken. All of the dishes in the cabinets had to be washed before we could use them. The shower curtains had mold growing on them. Ok, now the pool. It also looked great on the internet. Lazy river, a submarine for the kids to play in and a hot tub for the adults. Too bad it was covered in fire ants. I mean covered! Every chair, every table, every inch of concrete. It was finally addressed by the third day we were there. The staff told us before we rented it was easy to get from Lakeside to the beach. A golf cart shuttle would carry us from our duplex to the beach. Now the truth. First you carry all your stuff and the kids a quarter of a mile to the closest golf cart stop. You wait for 30+ minutes and a broken down golf cart shows up. This was the good part. They did not mention this service was only on the weekend. The rest of the time you drive your self in your own car.
