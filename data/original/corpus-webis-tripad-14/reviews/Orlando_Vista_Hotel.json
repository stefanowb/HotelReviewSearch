Had recently spent a night at a $60 a night hotel here and it was dreadful. We decided to try spending $90 and see what we got. Some of the reviews of this hotel concerned me, and I am very fussy about cleanliness. But I figured it had to be better than the $60 a night room. Some people wrote that the hotel looked worn. The only areas that seemed to look \"just a little worn\" were the floor hallways. The lobby was in great shape. The entire hotel is decorated in a colorful, art deco style. The rooms were VERY clean. The bathrooms are updated and also VERY clean. The beds were fabulous and had those big comfortors and pillows that five star hotels have. The comfortors are surrounded by a sheet under and on top of, just like the five star hotels. It's great to not have to have a blanket that has touched who knows how many people, touching you :o). The front desk check in person was very friendly and the comp check in cookies were delicious. One caution - if you're looking for a quick breakfast, don't be tempted by the Au Bon Pain in the lobby. At least don't order the bacon and egg croissant sandwich. It was terribly bland. That's really the only negative thing I can say about this property.

The hotel is not nice at all. We pulled up at 9pm (after a long flight) looked up and noticed most of the neon letters weren\u2019t working which didn\u2019t give a great first impression. We were shattered and walking into a musty and damp smelling room for the first time was horrid. The bedding was like something from the 70s and felt damp. The bathroom is very small and extremely tired looking and the noise from the air conditioning unit was so load you couldn\u2019t sleep with it on. We were on the 16th floor but I hear that the 17th is nicer but is mainly for Hilton honours members? I don't know. The view was of a petrol station, restaurants and the many many lanes of traffic. It reminded me of being stuck on the M25. I was ready to scream some mornings when the cleaners were outside hovering and banging about at around 8am. I know you don\u2019t go to Orlando to rest and stay in bed all day, don\u2019t get me wrong, but after a whole days travelling from the other side of America (we went to Las Vegas first then on to Orlando), a little rest wouldn\u2019t have gone a miss.
