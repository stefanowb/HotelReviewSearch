We loved the location, the friendliness of the staff, the bar area, the restaurant and the bedrooms. OK, the price was a little on the steep side but the accommodation we opted for was deluxe, with a very large bedroom, window facing towards the harbour, flat screen digital tv and a large walk in shower and toilet area. More like hotel accommodation than B&B really ! The first thing we noticed about the place was the relaxed atmosphere. The reception area was frequently unattended, and you had to make enquiries in the bar. That was fine by us. The staff are hard working and are friendly. We had dinner in the restaurant on our Saturday night and we both enjoying it, especially as we were seated at the window with the stunning harbour to look out at. We also loved the breakfast service. The full Irish breakfast was delicious, as was the cereal, fruit, pastries and yogurts on offer. The bar was very nice indeed and the service was exceptional. We are glad that we stayed here off season as I reckon the whole place would be packed during the summer months. Not a bad thing per se, but we love our peace and quiet. We'll be back here before the end of the year if the weather permits it. I really is an enchanting town and location to visit. A ferry ride to Cape Clear is also strongly recommended.

I was amazed to find the music was actually coming from the bar where a DJ was providing dance music for no more than five people. I told the barman our bedroom was hopping to the thud thud music and enquired as to what time the music would stop. I was told 1.30 a.m. (2 hrs later!). The barman asked the DJ to turn down the music, he obliged for no more than two seconds and then as if to make a clear point turned it back up even louder, which appeared to be an act of petty point scoring. I was extremely frustrated by this when I returned to my room I rang down to the bar but there was no answer. We are a young couple and enjoy late nights however this particular night we were exhausted and just wanted our sleep after a long day and a 3.5 hr journey home the next morning. We lay in bed for over 2 hrs waiting for the music to stop. It stopped at 1.45 a.m. We complained the following morning to the hotel receptionist who replied there had been several complaints about the music; she offered \u20ac20 off the bill as a token apology. We will NEVER stay at The Waterfront again. What is the point in having a disco for 5 people when there are paying customers trying to sleep?

For breakfast there is a huge choice, the menu shows what is on offer but you can have any combination you wish and nothing seems too much trouble (thanks Lisa).
