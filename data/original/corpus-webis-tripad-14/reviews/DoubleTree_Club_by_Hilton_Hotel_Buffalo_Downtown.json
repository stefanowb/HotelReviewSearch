We arrived back at the hotel at 2:40pm and were told that check in was at 3. OK, so you have no clean rooms and it is 20 minutes until everyone can check in? I do not think so. The front desk clerk was not friendly at all. We valet parked our car and had to give the keys to the desk clerk. No bellman in sight anywhere. We called for our car 20 minutes before needing it and it was still not there when we came downstairs. We ordered room service and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes. The worst tasting room service food I have ever had bar none! The area around the hotel is not a good place to be outside at night especially if you are a woman. No bellman available for check out either. We were put into a room on the 2nd floor after asking for an upper floor. The hotel is worn and in need of renovation.
