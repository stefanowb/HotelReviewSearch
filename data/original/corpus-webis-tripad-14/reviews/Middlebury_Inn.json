I stayed once last spring. Then I was booked the weekend of Hurricane Sandy and actually drove there only to ask if I could reschedule as I was worried about my home. They very graciously allowed me to reschedule until April and gave me all I had originally prepaid. They were so kind about it then and now. As for our stay this week, it was perfect. First all the things that come free with your room: wifi, computer and printer in lobby, coffee in the morning, afternoon tea with hot and cold beverages with cookies and pound cake. We stayed in the main part of the inn (room 111) in a lovely room on the first floor. King size, very comfortable bed, refrigerator, large tv, etc. Great view of the square. Quality toiletries, towels, etc. They do have an elevator but it must be run by an employee due to the style. It is actually quite cool looking. Any staff I asked to help me with the elevator were extremely pleasant. However I believe if mobility is an issue it is best to stay in the annex where you can be on the ground floor. I felt bad asking the staff to get the elevator since sometimes they had to walk up the stairs to get it. No one on the staff ever made me feel this way, as I said they were all very nice about it, it was just my own feeling of not wanting to bother people. If you stay in the annex it may not look exciting from the outside but it is beautiful inside. I stayed there last spring and loved it. The lobby area and restaurant at the inn are gorgeous. I suggest eating breakfast, for sure, at the inn but other meals too (I will do a separate review for Morgan's Tavern). The food is excellent. Overall I have to say that EVERYONE at the inn was very friendly and helpful from check-in to waitresses to housekeeping.

My wife and I both ordered a Scallop Fettuccine dish. When the food was served it was in a bowl with about an inch of broth. Not at all what the menu descried. When we searched for the fettuccine the closest we came were a couple green globs of pasta mush. No discernible noodles. The scallop were done nicely but the rest of the bowl (on a dish that should have been plated) was a mess. Also, I ordered the Onion soup as an appetizer which when arrived had lots of raw onion in it (shouldn't they be caramelized or at least cooked soft?), with a tasteless broth to go with. Upon noting this to the wait staff (they were always pleasant) we were offered a free desert but we weren't feeling up to it after our dinner experience. We were charged full price for the dinner with the tip that came to about $170. The following couple nights we were in Middlebury the Inn restaurant was quiet but the other places in town were very busy. We didn't mind waiting a 1/2 hour at the other places we went, the food was great. Supposedly the Scallop dish is off the menu but if you see it I would avoid it. By the way, I am in my 50's and this is the first trip advisor I have ever written - I don't want others to experience the food that we did. They need a new head chef, it was definitely Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmare material.
