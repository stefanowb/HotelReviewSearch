Less than 9 minutes away from the heart of the Quarter - we walked everywhere. The neighborhood the b & b is located in has its fair share of attractions - including great jazz, wonderful blues, excellent local restaraunts and far-out people and architecture. PLUS, there is a small grocery near by where you can purchase all that coffee and beignet mix you want to take home for 1/2 the price!
