I had tears in my eyes when entering the room it was so gorgeous. I am very fussy about accommodation and like to stay in 4 star or more. The Shore deserves a 5 star rating and if I could give it more, I would. Staff and service were great, food was beautiful (even cooked more bacon for me because I wanted it less crispy), room and facilities were gorgeous. The pool and view were amazing. We ended up spending more time in our room than we thought and it felt like we had been there longer than we had. We stayed in a villa higher up, too far to walk but a complimentary buggy was provided when required. It was very quiet and private (Swimming togs were not needed). You also have access to all the facilities at The Katathani. Kata Noi Beach was wonderful too, it is very quiet compared to Kata, Karon and Patong. If you want to experience these they are not far away. We hired a scooter down the road and parking space at The Shore was provided with 24hr security.
