The minute you walk through the huge wooden front doors you enter a quiet, cool oasis and leave the bustle of the city behind. We had the room shown in the brochure; it was large, clean and also had the added bonus of a balcony overlooking the courtyard. The hotel is a real \u201cfind\u201d and Sergio and his wife Elizabeth were perfect hosts. Sergio arranged our tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia and also recommended some excellent restaurants, even making our reservations. In all our years of travelling abroad we have never had the good fortune to experience the level of warmth and hospitality that we found at this wonderful hotel.

Residenza il Villino was the perfect retreat in Florence. Situated on a small quiet street, yet close enough to the center of town. 3 blocks from the Duomo, 5 blocks to San Lorenzo Market and Mercato Centrale. If traveling from the train station, and you have luggage, a taxi ride is best. Cost us 9 euros. However, the best asset of this hotel was our host, Sergio. He was so helpful, pleasant and accomodating. He provided us with excellent restaurant suggestions. The breakfast is served in a beautiful room, overlooking the courtyard. Cappucinos made to order. Internet access 24 hours a day if needed. The entire place is spotless. Spotless. Our room was very comfortable, television, mini fridge, nice size bathroom. We were sad to say goodbye. Our next hotel was a dissappointment compared to Il Villino. I believe all hotels from this point on will be compared to Il Villino. It was a joy to stay here in every possible way. If we ever have the chance to return to Florence, we will stay at Il Villino, without question. Hopefully there will be an availability.

We (in our early 60s) weren\u2019t disappointed at all!!!! The residencia is a converted convent with beamed ceilings, opening stained-glass windows, cozy furniture, mini-bar, closet and luggage stands. Sergio and Elizabeth, the owners, speak English and are extremely helpful and simpatico. They made our Uffizi and Accademia reservations for us when we reserved the room so we would not have to stand in line at the museums. We stayed in the upstairs Duomo-view room, which was spectacular and very romantic! What a thrill to see the Duomo and the quaint courtyards from the windows. There is no elevator, but Sergio insisted on carrying luggage for us. The bathroom was modern, absolutely clean and comfortable, with all the amenities. The location is perfect for walking to the Accademia, the Duomo, the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio. Florence attractions are all pretty close. I would recommend a taxi to and from the train station, however, since dragging suitcases over the rough paving stones and narrow sidewalks is not easy, although the distance is not that great. Sergio called a taxi for our departure and it was there in minutes. Breakfast included cereals, meat & cheese, breads, yoghurt, fruit, etc.\u2014not just sweet carbs. Cappucino/espresso made to order. Internet is available in the breakfast room. Hotel guests everywhere should be considerate of other guests and not stomp up and down stairs and shout to each other in the hallway. That was the only noise we heard one night. The Duomo bells ring on Sunday morning at 7 -- an awesome sound. We were there for March spring break, which meant great weather and fewer tourists. There were many groups of young students, but they were enjoyable fellow travelers. We ate at marvelous restaurants even in the touristy Duomo area. I would go back to Il Villino in a heartbeat. What a wonderful, friendly atmosphere \u2013 a little haven from the bustle of the Florence streets!
