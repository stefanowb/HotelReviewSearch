Bora Bora is amazing but we will never stay at this hotel again. I felt like we were gouged for every dollar, and I am a Gold Hilton Honors member. Upon arrival at the airport in Bora Bora, there is a lovely private Hilton white yacht to pick you up with flowers. Staff takes your bags and ushers you aboard. No one told us - even when I specifically asked - how much this yacht service was ($75 USD per person each way). Once arriving on the island (it is located on its own \"moto\" offshore from the main island of Bora Bora) at noon, we were told we could not check into our room until check in time, even though the room was ready to be occupied and I had confirmed early check in. This was annoying since we flew over 12 hours to get there and were in need of a shower. The food was horribly expensive and not that good. The boat shuttle to the main island was an additional cost so unless you wanted to be stuck you had to pay.

Bora Bora\u2019s legends, mysteries and romance lend an almost mystical dimension to its very name. The island rises up from the middle of the crystalline, multi-colored waters of its celebrated lagoon which is protected in turn from the ocean by a string of tiny coral islets.Suspended between turquoise waters and limitless skies, the Hilton Bora Bora Nui Resort & Spa nestles in a sacred cove of white sand and majestic lava rock. Here you will find a sensitive blend of authenticity and luxury - the very best of Polynesian tradition combined with sumptuous comfort."}
