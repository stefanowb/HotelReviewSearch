The front desk staff were excellent as ever, as were the breakfast staff, but that was about it. A lot of the inventory in the kitchen area was missing, there was no way that you would have been able to have cooked a decent meal with what was available, luckily we always eat out at night so it caused us no problems. The bathroom was never cleaned once during our stay, there was not even a brush to enable us to clean the loo ourselves, the bedding was also never changed during our stay. Speaking to other guests on the ski bus en-route to Marmot Basin they were also encountering the same problems so it was not an isolated incident, yes they were busy but that is no excuse for poor service of the basics you expect in a hotel. We only ate in the restaurant once and that was once too often, dreadful food and it used to be so good, what has happened here, I can only think that they have changed the chef. No atmosphere in the bar either, probably down to the miserable git behind the bar, I could not get over how unpolite he was, what a difference to the previous barman.", "title": "Standards Have Slipped", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Wafto", "date": "January 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 6573945, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Front office staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Room cleaning service and restaurant"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "very nice!", "text": "So to sum up, I was very disapointed about the Jasper Inn, it used to be so good but standards have slipped very badly.

From the time that we checked in, to the time that we checked out...we were treated VERY good. There was 4 rooms that we had booked and everyone had a great stay! The best thing for us, that they allowed dogs. Now, we were expecting a 'dog' unit to be stinky and stained carpet, etc. But you would NEVER be able to tell that it was a pet unit. It was great!!!! The only thing that kinda made me upset is that they KNEW that we had 2 dogs with us and that we needed a room that was ground unit and the dogs could be let out from the patio doors. Our room, had a HUGE drop over the patio door. We actually couldn't use it after all so we had to walk our dog all of the time (which was good for him!) but at times at night you don't feel like going out on a walk. So if you are brining a pet with you, ensure you get a room thats flat to the ground. Anyhow, no biggie and we didn't even complain so yeah. The kitchen units were WONDERFUL! We stayed in a one bedroom. The pool area was WONDERFUL and we only ate once at the restaurant as it was expensive and not our kind of food. However, we cooked the food we bought and on that note, I HIGHLY suggest going to the Super A as oppsed to the IGA as the prices are BRUTAL~", "title": "Cosy Room!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "5634", "date": "November 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6128093, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 cosiness of rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 no logs for the fireplace"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Anyhow, we will FORSURE stay there again!", "title": "Better than it looks!!!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "birka2106", "date": "October 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5960810, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The spacious rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 The restaurant"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I read other reviews of this hotel before booking it and I was pretty pleased with the result.
