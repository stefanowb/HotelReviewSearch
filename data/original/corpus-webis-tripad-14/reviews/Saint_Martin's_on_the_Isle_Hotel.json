It is possible that someone will buy the lease and reopen later this year but this is by no means certain. This move follows the closure of the only pub on the island and the ending of the helicopter service to the islands last year. Unless something is done to increase the quality and affordability of transport to the islands more closures are inevitable.

We love the informality of the Hotel and the whole experience and especially the Tean restaurant in the evening. Fine dining but not pretentious and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. I don't eat puddings but I always ask for and get a beautifully presented fruit platter which is divine and very much my kind of dessert. My husband on the other hand loves the delicious puddings and the presentation is exquisite. Long may the Hotel continue.
