As time wore on those places started to become less attractive to me as there were newer and more choices hitting the market. In selecting to stay at this Holiday Inn Express virtually sight unseen I took a bit of good natured ribbing from the family but that all stopped when we checked in. The first thing they all noticed is the expanded dining area for our complimentary breakfast as we knew we had to get up very early for a scalloping trip we were going on the next day. Then we got into the room and found our king sized beds to be better than those we have in our own homes. The next thing we noticed was they had both soft and hard pillows on the beds with pillow cases telling us which was which. I've stayed at some pretty fancy hotels and not felt as much at home as we did here.", "title": "Nothing like the older Holiday Inns we have come to pass by", "user": "DocMCSE", "date": "August 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 172844606}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My family and I stayed here the night before we went swimming with the Manatees. this was a one night stop during our 10 Florida vacation. we got to the hotel about 10:30 pm and the front desk employee was very friendly. the hotel itself appears to be new. Everything looked great. Our room was very nice and new. The room had extremely high ceilings which did cause an echo when we spoke amongst ourselves. The only issue I had was that when I requested a late checkout I was denied. As a platinum member IHG boasts that one of the benefits is a late checkout , up until 2 pm. Since we checked in so late we had no time to get things organized for the rest of our trip. Our tour was scheduled to be from 7-10:30 and i knew that by the time we got back to our room there would be no time for us to shower and leave. She said that they were too busy to let me have even a 12:00 checkout time, so we left as soon as we could. The front desk attendant said that late checkouts are not guaranteed. My issue is this; all the benefits that IHG offers the platinum member are subject to something and none are guaranteed. Any time I've asked to use one of these benefits I always get rejected. I just wish IHG wouldn't promote these benefits if they cant give them to their members.
