The place is consistently well staffed by people who notice you and ask if they can help in a proactive fasion. The rooms are a bit small, but that's what you get with an older property. And with an older property you also get more solid and quiet construction. I found most of the fixtures in the room of higher than average quality. Everything worked in my rooms there.

All I can say is WOW! I was sent to San Francisco for training. I am not a traveler. I rarely leave home without my husband. SO it was quite a surprise to me when my Boss said I would be going away (by myself) for two weeks, possibly 16 weeks I know nothing about big City living and I was scared. I went to The Chancellor's website to see what was available. There was a link to contact the manager so I did. I mentioned that I would be in the City alone and that I was afraid. When I checked in I got a big surprise as I was upgraded to a SUITE on the 15th floor! The Room was beautifully charming. It is not a brand new hotel but a cozy and historic building from around 1914. The bed was comfortable. The pillows were wonderful. They even have a pillow menu where you can order up what ever type of pillow you are used to sleeping with!! Rooms are very clean and updated with new and trendy furniture. The bathroom has a very deep bath tub which was perfect for taking hot baths after a long days work. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, cotton balls and even Q-tips are provided. For my second week at the hotel (I went home on the weekend) I did not have the SUITE.. However, I was given a room on the 15th floor that was equally as cozy and comfortable. Since I was staying for 5 days and wanted to have cold waters, I called down to the front desk and asked if they had a refrigerator that they could bring to me. They brought it up right away! Both rooms that I stayed in had a beautiful view of Union Square. I felt safe to walk around this area. This Hotel is in the Heart of things. You can easily catch a taxi or any other public transportation by just stepping outside of the building. The Staff was extremely friendly. The facility was very clean. The elevators were fast. The bar is small but I had a great time talking to other hotel guests and the Awesome Bartender named Alicia. She made me feel comfortable and even gave recommendations on things to do in San Fran as well as places to eat if I had craving for certain foods. They even have a plug underneath the bar to plug in your phone :) I thought that was cool!! Oh, there was a walk-in closet in both of my rooms. In the closet there was a safe where I kept personal items. Lastly I want to say that this hotel is VERY AFFORDABLE! I will be returning to San Francisco and when I do...

My luggage didn't make our connecting flight, but when we returned to the hotel that evening, my suitcase had been delivered and hotel staff put it in our room -- it was waiting for me there instead of downstairs at the front desk. Front desk was professional, helpful and competent. Soda, water and snacks were available for a reasonable price, and there were ice machines on every floor. The hotel feels classy and refined, with lots of brass and glass. Classic and tastefully understated decor. I rearranged the chairs in the room to give us a little more space -- but everyone says the rooms in SF are always tiny. Our room was small but not tiny. The bed was very comfortable. I didn't realize that they didn't have king beds, but the queen room we had (for a very reasonable price) was more than adequate. Great mattress and pillows. We didn't feel cramped. We are average sized people. If you are larger, you could request room with two twin beds and possibly put them together for a king? The bathroom was small, but very nice, and had a HUGE tub (no jets). They provided bath salts and I took advantage of a nice hot bath after we returned from walking all over SF for most of the day. No A/C, but we didn't need it. You can request a high or low floor, and you can request a \"quiet\" room. We were on the 10th floor on the back. It was perfect. We had a great view and no noise from the busy street on the front. This hotel is on the cable car line which runs up and down Powell Street. Very convenient. Just walk outside and there is a cable car stop -- you're on your way. The breakfast offered in this hotel was outstanding. Lots of great choices. I had New Orleans Eggs Benedict -- fantastic and fresh! Good coffee and service. Affordable and reasonable. Next door to Sears Inn, which has great swedish pancakes. Easy to get a cab to and from this hotel -- cabbies knew where our hotel was just by providing the name. I can't think of anything negative about this hotel.

We had requested a room on a high floor with a nice view if possible our suite didn\u2019t have a view so perhaps they we unable to give us a normal room with a view so they bumped us up to the suite?

We had a friendly welcome upon check-in by Steve, the guy who dealt with us and the process was quick and very efficient. He also gave us a map and told us to come to reception with any queries. I had made a request to Kevin Vossen prior to travel for one of their reburbished rooms on a high floor with a good view of Union Square and they were able to fulfil this request so thanks very much Kevin!! Brilliant view of Union Square day and night and the windows did a great job of blocking the noise out. The room was nicely decorated and clean. It was more than big enough for our needs and the bed was very comfy! Bathroom was clean and maybe a little small for some but we were happy with it. Having complimentary coffee and tea available (along with the cookies) is a really great idea and gives the guests so much freedom and free use of their computer for internet access is an added bonus. One of the best things about the hotel must be it's location to Union Square, the San Francisco centre and everything else. It's fantastic! We could spend all day sight seeing and then spend the evening shopping with it being so easily accessible! Union Square is also close to all the main transportation routes so is ideal as a base. We were originally going to stay on Fisherman's Wharf but upon visiting it are very glad that we didn't. Too touristy for our liking and a bit further out. Our recommendation is stay around the Union Square area, you won't regret it! So, to get back to it, we throughly enjoyed our trip to San Francisco and our stay at the Chancellor Hotel. San Francisco as a city is really great and our stay was made all the more better with us staying at the Chancellor Hotel. Well done Wes and co. keep up the good work!

So we had an unspent balance of $36 at the end of our stay. When I mentioned this problem at checkout, I was given a credit of $10, which to me seemed an inadequate response; I expected at least the $25 for the day the dining room was closed.

Although the room was very small (no room for a roll away), it was tastefully decorated. It's bedding was excellent. It had 4 pillows (you can request a variety of options), a fiberfill mattress topper, as well as 2 duvets with excellent linens. The carpet was newish with a tasteful plaid. The windows had sheers plus black out drapes which allowed sleeping in. Ours looked out on Powell & since we were on the third floor, when the window was open, it was very noisy. However, when closed it was very quiet & did not cause us any problem. ( They should do commercials for the effectiveness of their windows.) You would not be able to sleep with it open due to the noise, however. The hotel is not air conditioned but a ceiling fan was very efficient & served our needs. The bathroom is so tiny two people can't be in it at the same time, unless one wants to stand in the bathtub. However, it has a nice makeup mirror, good shower head, & plenty of lighting. In the room we appreciated & took advantage of the suitcase stands & safe & ice machine down the hall. In the lobby we enjoyed the gratis coffee, cookies, apples & newspapers provided.

I like that you are in the centre of everything and able to use transit to get to all areas of the city and then be able to return to your cosy room at the end of the day. For a solo traveller the rooms are roomy and as stated the closet is very large. The bathroom is small and adequate and has lovely green tea bath products. Pillows and bed is very comfy and as stated the hotel is historical so the hallways are a little tight . Staff are very friendly and will store your luggage if you have a later flight so you can explore more. Free access to printer and internet in lobby.
