The staff were attentive, the breakfast was fine, and the bed was pretty good but we found the room to be horribly uncomfortable and inconvenient. Given the choice I would never stay there again. The hotel was designed to appeal to people who value style above comfort. There are very few towel racks and no counter space in the bathroom to put your toothbrush, shaving supplies etc. There must be 15 or 16 light switches by the bed, controlling various combinations of lights. It was impossible to figure out what switch turned on or off what light. When we entered the room at night it was pitch black and very hard to find the switch to turn on the light. There is no desk; instead there is a bar with a high stool that is very uncomfortable for working at a computer. The fitness center is not airconditioned and very warm. The pool is outdoors and you have to cross a dirty concrete floor to get to it.
