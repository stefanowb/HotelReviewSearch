Would have liked to have stayed at one of the hotels by Kyoto train station/Bus Terminal (like the Granvia) as Kyoto is so easily navigated by bus, but rates for those hotels were very high. Still, the Aranvert was just down the street about 3 blocks from the station. A 15-minute walk or so. The hotel has a lovely lobby and the staff was very professional and courteous. You pay for your entire stay when you check in and they provide a receipt immediately. We had a double room and found the accomodations very clean. The carpet was stained by a bit of coffee, but looked fairly new otherwise. Bedspreads looked clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Great shower and bidet-toilet. My mother enjoyed the public bath very much - she went twice out of 4 nights. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone: families, elderly, singles, but I would try to book early and get into one of the hotels right across the the street from Kyoto station.
