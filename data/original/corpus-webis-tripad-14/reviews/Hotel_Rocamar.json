The rooms are rather spartan, but very clean and offer great prices when you consider its central location and the fact that it's right on the water (Atlantic or Caribbean side). The fresh breezes meant that air conditioning wasn't needed. We travelled with people who had been to Isla at least twice before, and we understand very well why they keep returning to Roca Mar. Getting off the ferry, we easily walked to the hotel in about 7 minutes - right up Morelos Street from the dock. The hotel is on the edge of the central plaza, anchored with the municipal offices, church and a large grocery store (good bakery and deli selections!). In the evenings there are a few vendors selling their crafts and foods (try the \"cheros\"!!) in and around the trees and open areas of the plaza. The main shopping and restaurant area (excellent variety) is an easy five minute stroll from the hotel. The evenings are very pleasant, and you can have a wonderful evening wandering past the shops (we found the vendors friendly and polite), having a leisurely meal at one of the many restaurants (good variety), and then wandering back to the hotel. There's a small restaurant at the corner of the hotel (indoor and patio) overlooking the ocean, offering a good variety of breakfasts and lunches. It seemed to be one of the more popular spots, and kept poor Pedro very busy going from table to table. Roca Mar is about midway along the Seawall Walk - a wide paved walk that parallels the coast and is ideal for leisurely strolling and breathing in the fresh sea air, sitting and reading on the wall, with the ocean below, or having a healthy walk or run. From the hotel, it's about a 10 or 15 minute walk, either along the streets or the seawall walk to the Playa Norte area. The beach along this stretch is beautiful with shallow waters and a wonderful protected lagoon on the east side, which is ideal for children and for snorkelling around the few offshore rocks. Roca Mar was a perfect location for us; everything we needed was easily accessible by foot, and the staff was friendly and very helpful whenever we had any questions.

You step into your room and you see huge waves crashing right outside your window. When I was there the wind howled and seethed through the shutters and the roar of the waves was not exactly soothing but it was dramatic. The rooms were attractive and very reasonably priced. The only thing that bothered me was the dampness that pervaded the rooms because of all the sea spray. The beds were a little hard and had few covers, although I could have asked for more. It was warm but often cloudy when we were there in January, so I could have used a little more coziness, but I'm sure coziness is not a quality often sought on the island. The balconies were nice and there were hooks for hammocks. There's nothing luxurious about the rooms--they are quite spare-- but they have everything you really need. No TV but there is a little refrigerator. No air conditioning but I think the wind off the sea would keep you pretty cool when it's very hot. Also there's a fan and you could sleep in a hammock on the balcony. The garden is particularly charming, with its palm trees and birds, comfortable places to sit, and hammocks where you can lie and look up at the palms and the fabulous frigate birds. There is a lot of nautical decoration all around the office, which is an open air pavilion in the middle of the garden, enhancing the ship-like atmosphere of the place. The terrace around the small pool overlooking the Caribbean is another pleasant place to hang out. Also the hotel is near the grocery store and the main plaza so you can get a taste of local life. The people who work there are intriquing characters. The place is kept spotlessly clean and there is coffee available and spring water from water coolers. There is a nice restaurant for breakfast in the same building and you are close to everthing. You can take a pleasant walk along the promenade to the North Beach.
