We were told in advance we'd have free shuttle service to the airport and that an early morning check-out would not be a problem. That was not the case! Several families were attempting to leave early and there wasn't a person around to assist us. You could have stolen the entire lobby because no one was at work. A janitor finally resurrected someone who ended up taking forever to get us out of there and then we were informed there was no one to drive us to the airport. A taxi was called but we had to pay for it -- and it was costly! We almost missed our flight because of the staff -- or lack of it. And good luck trying to get the management to even respond to a complaint. Frankly, I think everyone can do better than this place.", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 24, 2004", "id": 2782431}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Stage West = extraordinary value", "text": "I stay at the Stage West regularly while in the western Toronto area on business or in advance of flying out of Pearson Int'l Airport. This all-suites property is pristine throughout. The rooms are spacious and well furnished. The rates are reasonable. The hot & cold buffet breakfast (included with room) is terrific. I've not used the adjoining pool/aquatic centre, but it looks very good. Room service is very good. The hotel also boasts a large dinner theatre that offers a wide variety of performers. It is in walking distance of a half dozen good eateries and a few minutes drive to one of Toronto's largest malls, Square One.

They never asked over the phone for the age of the children and I was not a happy camper when they decided to pull this stunt.
