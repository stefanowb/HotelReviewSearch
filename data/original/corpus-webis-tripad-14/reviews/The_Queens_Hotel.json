It looked so promising from the outside but once inside we were amazed to see all the Christmas decorations out (middle of October). It got worse when we went to the restaurant. As soon as we had sat down our nice green napkins were taken off us and replaced with ones with holly on. Christmas crackers were on each table. The food was average, nothing special at all and it just seemed very depressing to see all the decorations out so early. We asked for a jug of water but were told they didn't do jugs, we could only have a glass (very strange). The wine waiter went round each table before then going to get the drinks so by the time our bottle of wine arrived we were well into the meal. Any later and I would have refused to pay for it. Decor was very dull and the staff seemed to be as depressed as we felt!", "title": "Christmas at The Queens - In October!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Cakesy", "date": "October 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 47102282}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best Hotel in Llandudno by Far", "text": "Please, October is too soon for Christmas festivities", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ShearingSearcher", "date": "August 9, 2009", "id": 37167079}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We've just returned from a short break at the Queens hotel, we have been on a number occasions and always found it to be first class.
