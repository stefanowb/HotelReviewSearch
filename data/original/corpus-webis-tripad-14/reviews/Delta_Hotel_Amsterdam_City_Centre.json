The photos of the rooms on the web site look great but trust me the room we were show to had no resemblence to the advert. The first room we were offered was very small and the bathroom was like a cupboard with broken tiles and black grouting, it had twin beds and my husband and I had booked a double, the nets at the windows were brown from smoking and it stunk. We went back to reception and asked for an upgrade and were taken to another room which did have a double bed but the curtains were also brown and the bathroom small and smelly again with broken tiles. There was no wardrobe in the room only an old broken chest of draws with a small TV on the top and a wooden chair to sit on so we had no where to put our suitcase or clothes. We again asked for another room but were told they were full and had no choice but to stay there. We decided to make the best of it and had a rest then went out for a meal and a walk we returned later and had a quick shower which to be fair was ok then went to bed. I got up around 3am to visit the toilet and opened the bathroom, put on the light and there was a huge cockroach sitting on the toilet seat and another one running across the floor to the pipes at the back of the loo. We got dressed and went downstairs to see the night manager who although did not speak English very well was very nice. He sent another guy who was working in the kitchens up stairs to get rid of them and he took of all things a can of Glade airfreshner with him, what for I will never know. He went into our bathroom, laughed and knocked the roach onto the floor and squished it, the other one had scarpered. We packed the few things we had taken out of the case and went down to reception to ask for a refund the guy who had diposed of the roach had returned to the kitchen with roach juice on his hands and shoes and carried on with out washing his hands (YUCK) We were told by the night manager he could not give us a refund and would have to wait for the day receptioist to arrive. We sat in the reception from 4am till she arrived at 8am and were told that we were dirty people and that we had bought the cockroaches in on out shoes, well forgive me but if I had a two inch bug on my shoe I think I would have noticed it. We left and went to the tourist board who booked us into the Crown Plaza American which was only \u00a35 a night more than the roach motel. They told us the Delta was only suitable for back packers and young people and that they should not have 3* in their opinion they should be graded at 1+. All in all our 4 night much needed trip away form work, kids and housework turned into a bit of a nightmare and would definitely NOT NOT NOT be staying in this flee pit again.", "title": "disgusting filthy rip off", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "NickyfromNotts", "date": "November 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4128202}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Grotty", "text": "Dirty, hot room.

We have travelled happily to Amsterdam 7 times and have stayed at the Delta 5 of those times and wished we had the other 2 times. YES the lobby is small (who cares?) but the staff has ALWAYS been more than gracious (ie: making us food & drinks AFTER the restaurant has closed, watched our luggage and chatted cheerfully with us). Grant it, we ALWAYS stay in our favorite room(s) - in particular room 330 or ANY room with the small balcony. These balcony rooms face the Dam (AND we were warned that it can get noisy) but for two people they're HUGE with tall ceilings and, as I mentioned, two french doors that open to a balcony overlooking the Dam. We were able to enjoy the Christmas parade right outside our room (Black Peter even threw candy up to us!). Yeah, breakfast was basic but never cold and I have NEVER seen any mice or critters in our room and the showers/bathrooms seemed no different from any other hotel.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 16, 2005", "id": 3909856}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "This hotel has TONS of personality, sits next door to a killer french fry stand and is a 4 minute walk from central station.

No window in Bathroom did make it a bit smelly at times but you could open the bedroom window. Fan in room, nice little touch and the last nights guests stuff in the bedside table!
