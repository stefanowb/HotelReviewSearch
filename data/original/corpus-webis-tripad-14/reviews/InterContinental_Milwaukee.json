Music was pretty good as I heard some old school jams like \"ring my bell\" and \"strawberry letter 22.\" But I felt this place was dead in a way.

What an unexpected and classy thing to do! Another great part of this hotel is the room service. Usually a hotel like this is really pricey and the food is only average, but not the IC Milwaukee. The breakfast was especially delicious, with generous amounts of food, all the condiments, and quick service. The price of each meal was no more than the same dinner would be out at a local restaurant. The rooms are a nice size with awesome modern furniture, and they are always super clean and organized.
