I cannot stress how amazing Blaine was and really helped to calm us down.

The building was built in 1924 and has lots of great Art Deco touches! Our check in with a credit card authorization beforehand from work was quick and seamless, and we all received our requested upper floor rooms. The rooms were very clean with great beds and wonderful city views. The bathrooms were large and well stocked with nice bath soaps, shampoos, etc. A Keurig coffee maker made making some outstanding coffee in the morning a breeze. The workout room was well equipped and I was the only person utilizing it both mornings. What was also fun was the nice staircase that spanned the entire 14 floors- a most excellent stairmaster!

Check in was very easy and they were having a cocktail night in the Hotel Bar, so the the desk clerk was nice and gave me a room on the other side of the hotel with a nice view of the Capital Building. The hotel is politically oriented so that was nice for a change from the standard hotel. The lobby is filled with law books and the elevators have quotes from politicians in them. I forgot a tube of toothpaste and a gentleman brought up a complimentary tube within a minute. They have soft fluffy robes and the bed was amazing.
