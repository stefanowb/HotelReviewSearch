Service was a bit off-hand. Breakfast was expensive. The bad bit was discovering we had to climb two flights of narrow stairs with our heavy bags. We were told there were no other rooms available, although the place seemed almost deserted. Our room was on the front, which was OK, although opposite the pub (thankfully rather quiet on the weekday night we were there). We tried the 'restaurant strip' across the road - it's really in the middle of nowhere, but with a long strip of tiny restaurants offering Chinese, Indian, Italian, you name it. We tried the Thai one and ordered their 'special' mussels - they took an age to come, and when we asked were told 'they are being steamed to infuse all the flavours', but actually they were being drastically overcooked and arrived as rubber, which we sent back and ended up eating nothing! So overall our one-night experience of Coff's Harbour and the Caribbean Motel was pretty disappointing, and we won't be going back.", "title": "Very disappointing", "user": "salmoneater", "date": "November 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 88198915}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Best value for money on our entire trip.
