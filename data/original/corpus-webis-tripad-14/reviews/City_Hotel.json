We stayed during the jazz festival and because of this the hotel was filled to capacity as a result of this getting a drink became time consuming as lobby was filled with jazz enthusiasts.

I had salmon which was very tasty, others had steak(medium rare), pork and chicken. Everyone was impressed with the meal and generous side orders. Deserts also did not disappoint - an excellent apple and cinnimon crumble(very generous portion) hot chocolate brownies, were the best.
