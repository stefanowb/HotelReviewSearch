Booked 2 rooms online and encountered some surprises upon check in. When I booked the room I thought my credit card was charged but there was only a hold put on the card. I had to pay for the rooms on arrival and the exchange rate was higher and resulted in an additional $40 dollars. The website indicated that there was parking available. Yes there is but it is about a 20 minute tram ride and walk or expensive hourly parking on the street near the hotel that was always full. We took the tram to the parking and had to drag our suitcases to and from the hotel. The parking garage was 16 euros. The rooms were clean and modern. The bathroom had European style tub/shower, toiletries, and a hairdryer. Our room faced the street with the tram so there was some noise when the tram was operating. Breakfast was 15 euros and was adequate. There were restaurants and shops near the hotel. A large flea market is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. You can buy a day pass for the tram and it was easy to get to the town center by tram.

There is a makeup mirror, but it was mounted 6 feet off the ground...and I am only 5'4\". We had 2 rooms, one overlooked a court yard (sort of), the other had a window, but the bottom of the window as 6 feet off the ground, so it made it impossible to look out or open or close the window. There was a small cafeteria-looking dining room for breakfast. The lobby reminded me of one in a small US motel. The sheets were scratchy and we thought we had book a king bed for ourselves, but we had 2 twins and were unable to change it. It is on the Tram line, but the 25 tram was not working the day we were there. It was a 10 - 15 minute walk to get to the nearest working tram. It is not in a great part of the city either.
