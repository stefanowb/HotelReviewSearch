We are actually in the time share buying market, and thought we would take the opportunity to tour the property. Our room was already pre-paid through Expedia, however, so we asked what compensation was available if the room was pre-paid. (They had been offering discounts off your stay). We were told at least three times in the last few months that we would receive a check (that we could cash anywhere! - their words!) upon completion of tour. Nothing was ever in writing, but we had talked several times to Louis. You can guess what happens next- no one has a record that we are to receive a check, and they say they do not do that. The irony in all of this is that we are actually buyers, as opposed to the people who are there for a free vacation and a cheap one time trip. If they treat the owners like this, who would want to buy there? After speaking with at least three rude people at the desk to try to clear up the confusion, we refused the tour, since they said we could take it, but would receive no compensation. The next day, I went back to use the wireless, (very inconvenient set-up) and the lady at the desk lied again, right to me, and told me I didn't give her a chance to check the computer. After 30 minutes of asking me who I talked to, and did I have it in writing, she could have suggested that she would check the computer.

You could not request a certain unit, it was pre-assigned. We stayed in the Townes, which was chosen because it was close to the pool.

But we had an outside streetlight right out the window of daughter's bedroom, that shone quite brightly through the night right into her window. No way to block the light, so she moved to the living room and slept on couch, which made her bedroom useless. Parking is hard during the day there because everyone drives down to use the pool, and they used the spaces in front of our condo everyday. So we usually were walking with lots of stuff. Whirlpool tub in master bath did not work. Pools are not monitored, and tons of kids are in the adult pool with no supervision. There is no miniature golf, wireless in all units (as I heard timeshare salesmen tell people). For what we paid, we could have gotten two hotel rooms right in WIlliamsburg, so the value was not that great. Unit was in poor shape - even though they claim that the Townes is the newer section. Very beat up walls, moldy, cracked shower tiles. No security guard at gate, tons of people were just driving in to use their pools.

The full-sized refrigerator and stove/oven/dishwasher were great - we are vegetarian so we cooked in the unit several times.

They have Internet-capable computers in the gift shop but the gift shop also has limited hours. The bed in the master bedrom was firm, which we like, but the mattress was obviously of low quality because we could easily hear the springs creaking when we moved.
