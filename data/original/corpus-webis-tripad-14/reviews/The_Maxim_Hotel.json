The single rooms are basic but they are not overpriced, the double rooms were well kept.Air con in the rooms work well and a quiet night's sleep is possible. The location of the hotel is its strongest point - on the sea front with a taxi rank close by and car hire offices (Thrifty is next door) within minutes. Good restaurants and ATMs are close at hand too. The hotel is fairly pricey but not by Israeli standards.

The price would be high by US standards (130 night) and the rooms were small, but by Israeli standards and for the location, this was good; Israel is the second most expensive country I've visited, and I've been to 25 in my lifetime. The staff were mostly abrupt, one or two friendly. One warning; if you ask them about a paid tour, they'll be helpful. If you ask them questions re; traveling on your own, expect dishonesty; they'll tell you you can't get to places on your own and of course you can, by bus or train. They make money on the paid tours they steer you to, that is. Breakfast is cold but reliable. We stayed there about 10 out of 18 days of our trip and they were good about reservations. Do note; what you've heard about Israel is true; many people are very rude and this takes some getting used to; however, all the holy sights are easily visited and a great place to explore another culture (we also went to Jordan on this trip). Service was actually better than when we stayed in Jerusalem and Eilat. GIven the alternatives, we would stay again in this hotel.
