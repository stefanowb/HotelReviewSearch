The best thing about this hotel is its location, it is very close to a whole array of shops, restaurants and nightlife. The room wasn't enormous but then it was only a single and with so much to do on your doorstep you aren't likely to be sitting in your room very much. Of the four hotels I stayed in on this trip to Japan I'd say this was my least favourite but it is by no means a bad hotel - it's just I'd say the room decor and hotel staff were just slightly below the very high standards set elsewhere. I'd definitely stay here again despite that though. Perhaps the only thing I would say is that It was a bit of a trek up to Shin-Osaka station so if you're planning on making lots of day trips by train you might be better staying elsewhere.", "title": "Good value for money", "user": "Filbert_Reynard", "date": "November 7, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10675853}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Have stayed at this location 7 times .
