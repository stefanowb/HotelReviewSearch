She was so sweet and made us feel right at home! We chose to eat dinner in the private dining room for guests. The dinner cost is over and above the room charge, and was reasonable and well worth it! The dining room had a rustic charm! We can't say enough about the dinner that was served; it was one of the BEST meals we had in France and we ate all over France! Aimee and her husband should be chef's! My husband went on and on about the Creme Brulee and said it was the best he ever had! It was such a nice experience staying at Le Moulin des Templiers!
