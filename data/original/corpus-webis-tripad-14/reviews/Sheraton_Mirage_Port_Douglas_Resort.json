We stayed in 3 seperate villas which were on the south side of the resort and were on the beachl. The grounds were so well kept and there were people working on them daily. Housekeeping was efficient and cleaned our villa everyday. The front desk staff were very friendly and accomadating. The tour guides were very patient with helping organize a few of our tours for a mere 22 people. The porters and the transportation team were always fun and friendly and very punctual. The shuttle bus is very handy and takes you right down town. We honestly did not have any complaints. The place is so nice. The breakfast buffet was unbelievable. There was everything imaginable on that buffet. It was included in the rate for the villa's and was perfect with that many people. Everyone could eat whenever they wanted to and it was enough food to hold everyone over until supper. We actually were not that impressed with the seafood buffet at night, don't get me wrong the selection was vast; however, it was quite expensive and did not taste as good as the restaurants downtown. The pools were awesome. I honestly can't say that I have ever seen such spectacular pools. I know some people say they were in need of repairs, however, we did not see this at all. The activities crew were wonderful as well. They were so kind and always assisted us with activities to do ( they taught the kids how to play cricket), provided us with volleyballs, goggles, bikes, etc. We found the entire place to be beautiful and we had a wonderful time and the trip of our lives. The beach was so clean and the water was perfect. A few of the women had massages and said they were very good. Some of the men played golf and said it was a beautiful cours and the staff was very friendly. They even saw croc's both time that they went. In addition, I read every review of this place before we left and was frankly a little nervous about staying there after reading all of the negative reviews. Honestly, I don't get it. The place was gorgous, in our opinion, and fortunately we didn't travel all the way to Australia on Holiday to walk around looking at the so called \"outdated\" lobby carpet or the \"paint chips\" in the pool.
