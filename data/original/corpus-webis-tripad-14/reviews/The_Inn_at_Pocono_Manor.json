(we actually honeymooned in the Pocono's at Brookdale 30 yrs ago but they closed a few years back) The atmosphere in the Inn was so tranquil. We had a great room, that we were able to watch the sunrise each morning. The weather was perfect 70/80's. Over all we had a wonderful stay and most likely would return We had buffet breakfast the first day, was good but bit pricey, and there was no option to just order breakfast. We did have dinner at the Exchange for our Anniversary dinner, it was excellent. The bartender (male) the first night was great. However the 2nd night, the bartender (female) seemed a bit frazzled and we felt that we were put on back burner. They had ground breaking for the new waterpark on the property. So the \"big guys\" were at the bar and we felt that bartender was ignoring us and waiting on them hand and foot. That was frustrating, as we were there first. We were not able to check out the gift shop as it was not open, very limited hours.", "title": "picture perfect", "user": "nooccaraa", "date": "October 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 179725426}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I actually stayed here twice. The first time was during New Years there were a few issues so they rewarded us a night free. I appreciated this since they were confident enough we could have a better stay. The second time we had a nice room with an impressive view. The view of the sunrise was priceless. We were able to see the sunrise because there was shouting in the hallway as a result of a domestic dispute around 4am. We called security and they responded very quickly to settle it down. I realize that a hotel cannot always control it's guests especially when those guests have been drinking all night at the wedding. Which leads me to conclude that I would definitely stay here again but would check to make sure a wedding was not scheduled. The food was very good. We ate at the restaurant inside the hotel (The Exchange), it was a bit pricey but good. We also paid for the breakfast buffet which was very good with a good selection. The hotel itself in the main building was very clean and the service at the front desk was helpful.", "title": "I would go back but only if a wedding was not going on", "user": "Nullion12", "date": "October 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 179454157}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed there for our anniversary weekend in the fall. We commented that this would be a great place to stay for any season. There are so many things to do, especially if you like spending time outdoors. We highly recommend the horseback riding down at the stables. We had never done this before and we both had a blast. The people that ran the stables were terrific and our ride was something that we will never forget. Although we did not get a chance to bring our clubs, everyone that we spoke to said both of the golf courses were immaculate. Our room was clean and comfortable and wow, the mattress was well...you will want to go out and buy one when you get home. If you get a chance, have dinner at least once at the Exchange, great food and even better service. Ask for a corner booth when making a reservation, a nice touch.

For starters, I have to say that we just really enjoyed the historic value of the Hotel and the property. We did not spend much time on the property itself; however, when we did, we enjoyed it. It's old world charm is great. We enjoyed our evening dining experiences there, and the two days we took advantage of the breakfast buffet. There are many points of interests in the area, and that is what we took advantage of during out visit. I will say that I thought the outdoor and indoor pool could have been a bit better. The outdoor pool needs a heater and the indoor pool because of its use just needs to be better maintained, but I can see how that is a challenge for them. Perhaps in the off season they will consider adding some of those features. I can see that they are doing work to the Hotel, which is always good to see. It did not bother us because I recognize it needs to be done.

We had a room with two Queen beds. They were comfortable. One of the elevators was down due to it be refurbished; however, the guests and the staff were sharing the one other small elevators, and the staff did not seem to mind craming themselves in with guests. Is there no service elevator? The front desk staff seemed a bit indifferent when it came to welcoming guests and upon check-in, and little to no information was given about the Hotel, it's services, or the property. The doorman/bellmen also seem a bit tired and beat up. The room we stayed in was a decent size but it does need some work. It was unique, but tired. The bathroom was large, but the shower (half tub) is strange. The water pressure also leaves a lot to be desired. The pictures of the Hotel in the room from the days in which it was perhaps in its hayday were the nicest features in the room. The TV worked fine, and the wall unit A/C worked well but a but noisy. The outdoor pool was too cold to swim in, and the pool furniture was limited and not kept tidy. It also had a lit id dead bugs in it. They may have froze to death. The indoor pool was warmer but it did not look or feel clean. It was cloudy and again, the pool furniture leaves a lot to be desired. A plentiful breakfast buffet is available each morning in a very large ballroom/dining room, but again, the servers seem to be a bit withdrawn and tired. Overall, this property seems as if it would require millions of dollars to make it a true luxury property and then hiring and training staff members to run it as so. Even as it is now, the staff could be a lot better, but I think they are beat up a bit with complaints and the overall condition of the Hotel. The one thing that we found enjoyable was dinner at the property, which we had twice. It was in a smaller and more intimate setting, and service was friendly and above average overall.
