I didn't notice this right away because the drapes were drawn when I entered the room after checking in. It was night when I opened them and didn't notice the construction site until 7am when the noise started. I could see them and they were close enough to see me...not comfortable! I wanted to wake up in the morning to the sites of the city and skyscapers, not a construction site. It was a pretty disappointing way to start my new life in vancouver. My company put me up in this hotel during my relocation. I had a early morning flight the day before with only a few hours of sleep...being woken up @ 7am to the noise of construction was not the way I wanted to start my day. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Just make sure you to ask that you have a room that does not face the construction. I don't plan to stay at a four seasons ever again.", "title": "I love having a view of construction workers when I wake up....", "user": "orange_crush6", "date": "March 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 58127637}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "On the night of my wedding night I booked at the Four Seasons for the night.

Subway right across street. If not renting a car ( which i suggest not to bec. you can go anywhere with subway or bus easily) its just one train to front of hotel from airport. Connected to mall is great especially when it rains. Can access mall before opening hours and it helped us because our 3 yr old needed to run and be entertained. Food court in mall also a plus along with food court of The Bay. London Drugs (convenience store) right across street and can access by never going out if you use mall entrance. Robson street for shopping is one block away. HOTEL: Clean and what to expect from 4 seasons. But hotel rooms a bit smaller than expected. Everything worked and no complaints. POOL: Average size and heated. Half the pool is indoors and the other is outdoors. Which was nice because we went in December 2009 and our daughter loved going outside and looking at the steam. Overall pool, jacuzzi and gym is fair. Remember its not a resort and in the heart of the city. FOOD: We tried the YEW restaurant and it was nice. We thought it was better than leaving hotel. Kids 5 and under eat free and they cater to the kids very well (the quantity is easily for a 5 year old). We aren\u2019t too picky with food so cant give a good comment on taste but we liked it.", "title": "great location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "travelingwithkeiko", "date": "March 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 57909528}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for my wife's birthday. Very trendy and modern feel to this four seasons - it goes well with the style of the city. We had a room (I forget what floor) with an unreal view of the bay and subsequent skyline. It is on top of a shopping plaza that is connected to the subway. Everything is within walking distance and as always, the Four Seasons experience and level of service did not disappoint. I would recommend the restaurant \"Gotham\", which is around the block. Fantastic wine selection, great steaks and the atmosphere was A+. This was a top recommendation from the concierge, which also set us up with a helicopter tour over to Vancouver Island.

It's like a library in a castle, really big and beautiful.
