The hotel is convenient to El Dorado airport and is located near several other hotels. Check-in was quick and a welcoming drink was handed to me at the front desk while I was checking in. The room had a portable air conditioning unit, which seemed to work well, but even with the air on \"high\", the room never seemed to get cold. This is odd considering the air temp in Bogota was in the 50's. I got in late, so I didn't have a chance to check out the restaurant and had to leave early, i.e. 4:15am, to catch a very early flight. When I went down to check out just before 4:00am, I asked about printing a document in the Business Center. The Desk Clerk pointed to where the Business Center was and I went in. To my surprise there was a young man in a suit and tie (before 4 am!) sitting there waiting to help anyone in need.

The free shuttle from El Dorado airport was a huge bonus. The hotel even sent a photograph of the member of staff that would be waiting to meet me. Check in staff very friendly, although there was a delay in the process because I had booked with GHL Hotels online, and they were having problems matching the rate I had been given. My room was very nice, although temperature control was a little difficult. There is free Wifi throughout the hotel, but there are lots of different networks throughout. This became hugely frustrating because you had to repeatedly log in to a new network whenever you moved around the hotel. I tried the restaurant one evening, food was okay, small portions, and quite expensive. The free buffet breakfast was excellent, made to order omelettes were good, and there was a different choice of tapa-style dish each day. Bread and pastries were excellent. The bar area was small but friendly.

Additionally, the breakfast buffet has great healthy options to choose from. If your stay is longer, I don't recommend it. It is about a 20 min cab ride from the Zona T, Parque 93 and zona rosa.
