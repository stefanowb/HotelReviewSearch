We checked in at about 8.00am and they were great. Not charming or anything, but efficient. The hotel is clean, with facilities very much geared towards the Kiwi businessman. The room, while maybe a tad dated (lots of wood) was also clean and very comfortable. I note other quite negative comments on the site, but I thought this was a pretty good hotel It suffered from the usual rubbish gym, which they hastily put in as they felt a business hotel needed it, but otherwise was absolutely fine. Nicely located in the city centre, near restaurants, shops and not far from Te Papa.
