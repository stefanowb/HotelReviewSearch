A pleasant design with light airy and modern rooms. Well fitted bathrooms with hair dryer and also an iron and ironing board in each room. Flat scren TV also. Draw back is the very small 2'6\" single beds!!! Fairly comfortable but oh so small - have no idea how larger/taller people get on, but we found them uncomfortable. On our first night we were allocated a room on the first floor overlooking the reception/bar area and for some reason there was jazz music playing all night long!! We complained at 1am, 2am and again at 3 am and were simply told they couldn't turn it off!! Neddless to say we complained again the following day and were moved to a quieter room overlooking the side road. Noise from the bar/reception is a real issue though because of the design of the area, everything echoes.
