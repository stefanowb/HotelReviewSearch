However, what makes Hotel Contessa exceptional is its courteous and attentive staff. Two staff members who stand-out during my stay are Eddie G. of the lobby/arrival team and Leo who handled the valet parking and offered great advice on local restaurants. Eddie G. is an extremely professional and service oriented member of the team. His energy is amazing and he seemed to predict what a customer needed. Leo not only took care of our vehicle he was interested in the care of the passengers. Leo provided a great tip for a lunch time restaurant that ranks as the top place we ate during our stay in San Antonio.
