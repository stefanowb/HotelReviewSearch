My wife and I stay at them regularly. In fact I'm at one as I write this review. Hampton Inn Phoenix/Scottsdale at Shea Blvd is below par. The place is shabby. The walls need a good paint job, the walcovering needs to be changed. The A/C in our room was noisy (rattled case when compressor engaged). The shower drain didn't drain very well. By he time the shower was finished I was tanding in 3 inches of water. The tile piece next to the tub/shower was missing and wall covering was lose.
