It was our second stay and it won\u2019t be our last. It has the feel of a business hotel but with grace and style. It\u2019s right around the corner from the main train station and within a short walk of the Duomo and the Ponte Vecchio, in short right in the middle of everything. Our room was spacious and our bathroom enormous. A very nice breakfast was included in the reasonable price. In the evening they have a great free appetizer spread in their small bar. The public rooms are pretty and pleasant for sitting. It\u2019s a great place for a group occupying 2 or more rooms. You feel very comfortable waiting for folks to gather at the beginning or end of a day of sightseeing.", "title": "Business hotel with elegant style, great for tourists too", "user": "FloridaTravelmum", "date": "December 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 90335265}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is exquisite!

This was our second hotel that we stayed at during your 10 day tour and I have so much to compliment this hotel on that I do not know where to begin. This is exactly what I imagined Italy. We got into our room that overlooked the Piazza Santa Maria Novella and our ceilings were between 10-15ft high and the windows went to the top. They were huge I opened the windows to allow the cool breeze in and you heard the church bells, people laughing, playing, the locals playing football (Soccer in USA). It was incredible. The next morining we awoke and had an amazing breakfast. Hotel staff was great. Right near the train station and the restraunt Boca Mario which was delicious! Near the shopping and the uffizzi gallery. No complaints at all! Room service was impecible. Would recommend this hotel to everyone! We loved it and look forward to our next trip! The only thing that was a bit of a concern were all the gypsies that flocked the area when they knew there were tourists. They would not leave us alone but that is no reflection on the hotel or the staff there.", "title": "Fantastic Hotel - an experience", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "adammatthew", "date": "November 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 88226059}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We came to Florence (Firenze) for a family wedding in late August - We booked this hotel in April and we did not expect too much but when we arrived we were absolutely overcome with how friendly the staff were - our room comfortable and the bathroom was fine. Breakfast is one of the best features as the food caters for EVERYONE (whatever diet) in a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. The roof top pool is pleasant (with fantastic views) although we never used the pool we did have a late night drink by it on a couple of occasions! Drinks are expensive and the Hotel do not do themselves any favours by charging so much - \"supply and demand\" may be a more profitable option for them as most guests choose to drink elsewhere at cheaper prices! The hotel could not be in a better position - central is an understatement - you have everything at hand - good restaurants and we found them not to be quite as expensive as we thought - for one of the better meals it cost (for 2 of us) about Euros 90 including a bottle of wine - but you can get cheaper for a lot less (they do have a McDonalds but not our scene!). A MUST if you visit Firenze is to take the open top bus around this beautiful city - there are two tours and I recommend you take both - Red tour and Blue tour - useable over 48hrs so you dont have to do both on the same day and extremely good value! - its the way to see Florence (Firenze).

We asked to switch rooms and the lady at the front desk didn't seem pleased. First she said that there were no available rooms left- I told her that I didn't buy it. Then she said that she had a room overlooking the piazza but that it would probably be \"too noisy\" for us. She failed to mention that it was a smoking room- when we got the the room, and we realized it was a smoking room due to the smell, I had to ask for yet another room. I think she got sick of dealing with us, because the next time we were given a room with a beautiful view of the piazza and duomo!
