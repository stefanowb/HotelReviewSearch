It made it difficult for us all to sleep, especially our baby son.

We have stopped at this hotel several times in the past before it became a Wetherspoons and we wondered what it would be like now they have taken it over. They have done an excellent job refurbishing it. Our room was spotlessly clean with everything we needed, bed and pillows comfy and room nice and warm all night. Staff were helpful and friendly. No-one was manning reception when we checked in/checked out but someone arrived within minutes and checking both in/out were carried out efficiently. Fortunately we had booked an evening meal at another hotel just down the road (The Bell - highly recommended) because we knew getting a table in a Wetherspoons on a Saturday night would be near impossible. (No problem if you are eating early, plenty of tables at around 5.00 pm). We did want to have a couple of drinks before retiring to bed but no chance of getting near the bar, by 8.30 pm the pub was heaving. We were worried that there would be no chance of having an early night with all the noise from the bar but our room was surprising quiet and we had no problems at all. Had breakfast the following morning, my husband has what he calls the \"big boy\" breakfast and boy was it big, huge plateful of food, all well cooked for just under \u00a35. I had a toasted tea cake and cup of tea for \u00a31.79. Food, drinks and room price all fantastic value for money.

However, eventually it was named The Royal Hop Pole when Queen Mary stayed in 1937 and gave it the official 'Royal.' Charles Dickens even mentions The Royal Hop Pole in his first novel, The Pickwick Papers. Other interesting information and pictures are located all over the hotel, including information on how the Medieval Banqueting Hall was discovered when the hotel was recently refurbished. The Royal Hop Pole has its own beautiful garden which leads to the banks of The River; there you can see picturesque views of the surrounding countryside and the Malverns."}
