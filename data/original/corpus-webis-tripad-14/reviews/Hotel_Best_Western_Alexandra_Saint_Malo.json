It is unparalleled for its beach location. From your room you can sit on a small balcony or in a glass enclosed bay window (my favourite and suggest you ask for one of these rooms) and see the ocean rise and fall (huge tide) and watch the many activities on the beach. The hotel has a very good restaurant or you can do what we did and walk up the beach or the incredible paved walkway to the historic St Malo old town where you are literally surrounded by restaurants (20min stroll). The rooms are medium sized with a separate toilet and well equipped bathroom. Beds are extremely comfortable and the windows open to let in fresh air and relaxing sea sounds. There is no traffic noise and you rarely hear a sound from other guests. The Tv offers many different language channels (great for us as we have been, on a long holiday, bereft of a choice of English speaking channels for a while). Parking is very easy in this hotel.
