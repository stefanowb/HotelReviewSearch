We were so pleasantly surprised with the accommodations there. My husband, myself and our 3 children stayed June 19th, 2005 for 1 night before an early morning flight. We have stayed at several Tampa Hotels before an early morning flight on various park and fly program hotels and not one of them was worth writing about. The Mainsail is another story. These \"suites\" are more like spacious apartments. We reserved a quad room. 2 bedrooms (with 2 beds in each bedroom), 2 full bathrooms. Quality toiletries, plenty of towels, extra pillows, blankets, etc. A full kitchen, living room, and dining room. We went to the weight room and it was huge. They allowed all 3 of my children, ages 7, 13 & 16 to use the exercise room. We then used the pool which was heated and again, huge. We had a 6:00 a.m. flight. We requested the shuttle to pick us up at 4:40 a.m. He arrived at our room at 4:37 a.m. He loaded the shuttle with our luggage and were at the airport in minutes. The driver was very friendly. We were able to park our car at the Hotel for the length of our vacation. They had no restrictions on the amount of days, etc. They don't advertise a park & fly program but when you call and tell them that's what you want, they told me that I could park the car there as long as I needed to. There was no charge to leave the car there while we were away. When we returned to Tampa, we called Mainsail from a courtesy phone at baggage pick up and we were given friendly instructions on where to wait for the shuttle to pick us up. He arrived soon after and returned us to our car and unloaded our luggage to our vehicle. The rates were 1/2 the price of other hotels near the airport (we were 1/2 mile from Tampa International) and we got twice the room, service, etc. We will stay at the Mainsail every time we have an early flight out of Tampa and we plan on staying there for our next soccer tournement!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Dfab5", "date": "June 29, 2005", "id": 3618793}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "Due to the reviews here (and I did some research even for our only one night stay), I chose Mainsail.
