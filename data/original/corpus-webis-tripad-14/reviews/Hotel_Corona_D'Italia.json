Super friendly folks in a beautiful room and extremely convenient location. Their breakfast was filling in the American sense, not super fancy but it was free and filling if you are used to eating a hearty breakfast in the morning. They were super sweet and allowed us to keep our bags there past outr stay and it was only a hop, skip and a jump to the train station. My bofriend just recently went back to do some business there and was upgraded for free into a larger bed! The Maitre 'D was a gem and I truly felt I was staying at a grand place.

It is worth it to speak up, though, because at first they gave us a room with 2 single beds on the first floor, even though we reserved a double room. We said something, and they moved us to a bigger room with a King bed and bigger bathroom on the 3rd floor. We still heard noise from the maids pushing their carts around on the tile floors in the hallway early in the morning (the hallways and rooms were not carpeted). The breakfast was mediocre, called a \u201cbuffet breakfast\u201d with no hot food, some weird-looking cold cuts, cheeses, pastries, yogurt and some fruit. We found no hot water if we tried to shower around 8:30 in the morning, but it was fine if we showered later in the day. The best thing about our hotel was the location, which was a five-minute walk from the train station, right near the Mercato Centrale (central marketplace, like a flea-market with indoor food vendors), and 10 minutes from the Duomo.", "title": "You get what you pay for", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "jen611", "date": "January 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4353033}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Never Again!", "text": "We stayed in this hotel for two nights. Note to all travelers: Do NOT stay in this hotel if you plan to drive yourselves to Florence! We called the hotel THREE times on our cell phone for directions to the hotel from major landmarks within Florence. Each time, we were told that the directions were \"too confusing\" to explain. We spent FOUR hours driving around Florence and asking strangers for help before finding the hotel. If we had not had pre-paid reservations, we would have given up! Once we arrived at the hotel, we were told we had to pay 23 euro per day to park in a garage (or have our car towed from the street) even though we were told there was free parking when we made our reservation. The front desk staff was most unhelpful, slightly rude, and uninterested in helping tourists (we were not the only people, nor the only nationality, having trouble). Upon arrival, we were told we \"had\" to wait for the bellhop to escort us to our room (we had one suitcase, our room was on the second floor, and there was an elevator). We waited almost 10 minutes for the bellhop to come and though we tried to say several times during those 10 minutes that we could find our room ourselves, we were always told that we must wait. The room was of a good size but sparsely decorated. One of the larger bathrooms we had on our trip. The room was very clean and despite being located on a very busy street, little noise could be heard in the room. Location was fair, a fifteen or twenty minute walk to the Duomo. We would not recommend this hotel to car travelers or to travelers who are looking to stay in upscale hotels. The more modest price of this hotel is not worth the problems we had with it.

The staff were very curtious and helpful. They recommended a great restaurant, which was the greatest food I have ever tasted, called Za Za.
