The location on Georges St cannot be beaten, especially if you wish to be close to the best shopping and bars that Edinburgh has to offer. Stayed in room no. 11 (delux double) and it was amazing. The beds are uber comfortable. The little extras in the room include an i-pod loaded with tunes, fresh fruit, The White Company toiletries, a GHD hair straighteners and someone comes to fill up your ice bucket when you have checked in. The bathroom is vast but did not have a bath tub which may bother some people. The bar is THE place to be and be seen in Edinburgh and has a club downstairs \"Lulu\". We ate in the restaurant and the food was excellent. The hotel and restaurant staff could not be faulted. As this is a boutique style hotel with a popular bar and nightclub I would not particularly recommend it for families. A very slight din could be heard in our room from the bar but it did not bother us. I would suggest booking a room on one of the top floors if you are noise sensitive.
