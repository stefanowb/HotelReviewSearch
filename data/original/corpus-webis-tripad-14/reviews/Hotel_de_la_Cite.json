The room was very well equipped with an abundance of smellies and handy items, there was even an umbrella in the room for our use if needed. The hotel is over 100 years old, and they have an 'audio tour' which is free to do and which we found very interesting. It gave us the opportunity to have a good look around the beautiful rooms and gardens, and tell us about the history of the this lovely hotel. The staff were all lovely - helpful, polite, warm and friendly.
