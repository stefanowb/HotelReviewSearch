Absolutely beautiful hotel, wonderful staff. Excellent breakfast spread in the dining room every morning. We had a King Suite. Beautiful, immaculate room! The bed is absolutely to DIE for! Never slept in anything like it. Crisp white linens, TONS of wonderful down pillows, beautiful lush down comforter with suede duvet. Fit for a queen. Really hated to get out of bed every morning. Beautiful decor and carpets. Very modern furniture. The entire suite was immaculate. Could have eaten off the bathroom floor. I'm a stickler for cleanliness in a hotel room and this place was pristine! They call you in your room asking if you need anything a few times after you get settled. If you need anything, they are there immediately. We were treated like royalty at this hotel. If in St. Louis, you won't be disappointed in your stay here. Worth MUCH more than we had to pay. Very quiet, friendly, awesome service, immaculate in every respect. I will definitlly be back time and time again. The only thing I would change is that they have no room service.

This property was my first time at a Homewood, I normally stay Hyatt Place or Marriott Courtyards when in suburbs of cities in the midwest.

Upon first impression, the hotel is extremely nice. It appears new, or newly remodeled (not sure which, from the lobby to the room. The mini kitchen area is very nicely decorated, as is the sitting room. The bedroom is also very nice, although neither my friend or I enjoyed the mattress very much. There's a nice vanity area outside of the bathroom which is also very nice. The only area that seemed to have missed the renovation was the bathroom itself. That seemed much more basic and standard, and maybe even a little dirty (shower curtain). Also it would've been nice to have a working fan in the bathroom because it got extremely hot in there when showering! The location of the hotel is great in that is very close to many shops and restaurants. However, it is right next to an expressway, which can be very noisy at night. I would suggest that you ask for a room away from the expressway. The hotel's pool is pretty tiny, although it is nice that they have a pool at all.

Things soon settled down and went smoothly from then on. The good things: The price was right. The King Suite had lots of room, a comfy bed and a well equipped kitchen. Wireless is easy to access and fast. There's an outstanding fitness center--far beyond the two-treadmills-and-an-elliptical you usually see. It has everything my local Y has except a running track. Staff throughout the hotel look for ways to be helpful, but the breakfast staff really shines. The bad things: The suites need a place inside the door to hang coats; even a coat rack would help. The locale is busy and congested with fast-moving traffic. While there are some excellent restaurants in the general area (check out the many options in Clayton's downtown several blocks to the north) there aren't many within walking distance.", "title": "Great Hotel !
