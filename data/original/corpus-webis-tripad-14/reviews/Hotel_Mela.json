My husband and I arrived at the hotel at 11.30pm on our first night and they gave us a room on what they call the 2nd floor (1st floor to Europeans). I was immediately nervous as there was scaffolding right outside our window and there was obviously building work going on. I spoke to Harold at reception and he assured me it was \"light\" building and told me no other guests had complained (not sure I believe that). He wouldn't change our room (apparently they were full) but said he would change it the next day. As predicted it was noisy all night (from the bar next door) and in the morning (from the building site). The room itself was nice (deluxe room) but there were some hairs in the bathroom and the carpet wasn't overly clean. The next day after speaking to reception again, they agreed to change our room to the 15th floor. This room was a million times quieter and slightly bigger and also cleaner (although carpet cleanliness was still an issue). The rest of our stay was really good with no problems. The bed was really comfy, the room was cleaned properly every day and staff were friendly. They also have free WIFI in all rooms which was fantastic.

I was fairly disappointed with my experience. I travel to NYC about 4 times a year and have stayed at quite a few hotels there, some worse, some much better. Yes, the Mela is a boutique hotel but I wouldn't call it trendy, unless a couple of shabby sofas in the small lobby and piped-in electronica deem it as such. Everything about the Mela is tiny, the elevators, the hallways, the rooms themselves, but that was understood from the other reviews. What I didn't expect was how aesthetically mundane the place is. I had an executive suite which was anything but spectacular. Rather, it was dark, drab and lifeless. No view. Flat screen TV was the cheapest I'd ever seen with truly abysmal reception. Bathroom was clean and small, and the brightest spot in the entire hotel. So, overall, the room was clean but unremarkable, forgettable. And over my 10 night stay, here are some of the problems I encountered: Room service food was really awful, and slow too. Ordered a bagel and lox one morning and it took 45 minutes and arrived without creme cheese. When I phoned down, they said they'd send some right up. Arrived 45 minutes later, after another phone call. Another morning, I was awoken at 7am by a knock on my door. My breakfast order had arrived. Too bad I hadn't placed one. Then there was the cleaning staff, the loudest you will ever encounter. They apparently had no regard for the fact that guests might be sleeping, or else wanted to wake them early to get them out of their rooms so they could clean. They marched up and down the halls, spoke to each other on walkie-talkies so loud that I could hear every word, banged doors and hit walls with their supplies. And yet they still managed to forget to refill empty Kleenex, pick up dirty glasses, leave new tea and coffee bags, and even left me with no toilet paper one morning. And speaking of slamming doors, something must be done about this. The doors tend to slam shut if you let go of them before closing them all the way, meaning that if you stay at this hotel, be prepared for lots of slamming doors at all hours from every guest coming or leaving. And on more than one occasion, I heard other guests sneezing and talking in their rooms, even heard someone taking a shower. Basically, this is a very loud hotel. Not soothing in the slightest. Finally, there are the wake up calls I ordered that never came or, inexplicably, came late!?!? How exactly does that happen? And the perfect coda to my experience with the Mela? Went to use the express checkout as I was leaving, and it didn't work. And it sorta made sense because nothing about my stay at the Mela was convenient in any way, shape or form. No, I won't stay there again.
