Our room was on the 41st floor and had a nice view so that we could see the Rockefeller Center. The elevators went so fast they made our ears pop! The rooms were lovely and clean and modern with a flat screen TV on the wall as well as a coffee and tea maker. There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space for all our clothes etc. Down in the lobby, it can get very busy, especially when there are large groups of people traveling together which we found a lot of, however it was Easter break. The rooms do not come with free Wi-Fi which I was disappointed with, but I used the computers in the lobby instead (however as there are not many, you have to go at quiet times!). The staff in the lobby did help us well. On our last day, we needed to store our luggage as we had a later pick up than the check out time. We got caught behind a very large group altogether and stood in the queue for around an hour! When we got to the room, we discovered that they charge $3.25 a bag. Another thing I should point out, is that the mini- bar in the room is sensor activated, so that if you take out or move a particular item, it automatically assumes you have used that item and it will go onto your bill. We had moved some things to fit our own drinks in and when we explained to the reception on check out that we did not use them, we had just moved them, they took them off our bill which was fine.", "title": "NA in NYC", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Marcus K", "date": "April 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 157745786}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "New York City"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 110, "average": 319, "very good": 778, "terrible": 55, "excellent": 569}, "aka": "Sheraton New York Hotel And Towers", "slim_ranking": 0.487584650113, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Sheraton New York Times Square hotel is located between Central Park and Times Square in Manhattan's Midtown business and entertainment district.
