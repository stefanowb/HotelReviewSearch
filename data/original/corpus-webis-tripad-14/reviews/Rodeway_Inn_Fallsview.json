What a deal it was! Our family of 4 had a wonderful time during our 3 nights stay. Free parking is definitely a bonus, as well as early checkin at noon. Upon making a reservation, we requested a refrigerator (for a $10 fee) and we were able to use a microwave in the main hallway. We stayed on the first floor of the newer section (we requested this based on a review we read) and loved the layout of the oversized room! Most hotels we've stayed in didn't have the floor space that this room had. It also had a separate luggage storage area. The room was kept very clean (good maid service). The staff was exceptionally helpful and never seemed to mind being asked for advice or guidance on how to get the best view of the falls, find a store, etc! The location was excellent - close to the falls, but in the quiet Fallsview part of town. The only disappointment is that our kids were looking forward to playing on the playground equipment, which was recently taken down. However, we stayed very busy sightseeing, and did not feel it was a big deal.
