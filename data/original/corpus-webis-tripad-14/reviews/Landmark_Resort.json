I will say they had a great DJ around the swimming pool area that kept everyone entertained but they need some work on the front desk.. Checking out is a nightmare if you have to pay a security deposit, at that point you are ready to check out and go home but I had to wait at least 30 minutes for the staff to inspect my room before they would give my money back! We went and asked for coffee for the room a few times and they had to ask our room # and would only give you 2 packs at a time which bothered me since we drink a lot of coffee although they didn't charge us for the coffee it makes you feel like you are bothering them when you have to ask for it and they write your room number down every time! I called the front desk and asked for a roll a way bed( which they do not offer) and gave me some lousy number to call so I could rent one which is ridicilous cause I could never get an answer at that number anyway. As far as the location it's great, the rooms are ok and most of the staff are nice but they do need to do some work about the elevators.. We had to wait 5-10 minutes every time we used the elevators near the pool so we could head out to the beach maybe it was because it was a holiday but it was aggravating and they need to keep the floors on the elevators moped up better, but besides that it was a nice place to stay.", "user": "pamelajr9", "date": "July 7, 2013", "id": 166574398}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Family friendly clean fun resort", "text": "Great place to stay. The pool was good and clean, house keeping is the best. Would not stay any where else. We stay here every year and will continue to stay here every time we visit myrtle beach.

I was excited to stay in a resort as I have on other trips and had great experiences. I did not feel that this was a \"resort,\" it is just a standard hotel on the beach. Whenever I would ask the staff a question they would just sorta guess what the answer is so that they could move onto the next thing instead of actually finding the correct information. The hotel was not very clean, and the towels in the bathroom were way too small... (I am only five foot tall and 110 lbs and they barley covered me.) The cleaning crew was very nice, but they did not change the sheets the entire time we were there, just re-made the bed. They never whipped off the dressers/tables that were covered in sand due to the beach being close by. We were lucky if there were towels available by the pool for us to use, and there were signs in the room saying to not take your towels from the room to the pool. I saw cockroaches by the jacuzzi in the pool area, which was open to the beach so I am not sure there is much they could really do about that. I would not stay at any of the hotels in South Myrtle Beach again. They advertise on the websites that things are close by, but in reality we needed to take a taxi to get anywhere besides the beach. There were NO restaurants or shopping centers within walking distance close by whatsoever except for what was in our hotel. We received poor service at the pool side snack place called Sharkbites. My friend and I each ordered two hot dogs and for some reason they decided to cook hers inside and then drag out all the supplies outside to grill mine on the grill...needless to say 15 plus minutes later hers were cold. The fire alarm also went off multiple times on our trip, and we received a wake up call that we didn't ask for with no apology. Upon our departure we asked for the free shuttle that takes you to the airport. The lady at the front desk advised it would start at 7 a.m. After sitting there for 30 minutes with no shuttle we asked again. There seemed to be a lot of confusion like they did not know we were waiting for one, and we then found out from a different lady that there would be no shuttle this morning and they would call a cab for us and pay for it. It was nice of them to offer to pay, but if they would have found out the correct information the first time it would have speed things up. There are not many good things I can say other than it was extremely affordable and right on the beach. To me that is not worth it when you are taking a vacation that you never get to go on.", "user": "Lindsey M", "date": "July 6, 2013", "id": 166533654}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Been staying since 2006", "text": "We love to stay at the Landmark Resort we stay every year and sometimes 2 or 3 times a year and enjoy our stay everytime the rooms are clean and the staff is awesome.

We won't be back. I do not feel a sense of pride in the place from the employees. They didn't have a nice appearance about themselves let alone their work. Housekeeping didn't seem to want to clean our room, just drop off towels. Rooms are not clean or maintained. They have lots of pools, hot tubs and lazy rivers that were great for entertainment, but I just didn't feel were clean. I did see people cleaning in the pool area across the street and there were staff checking who was coming and going from that area, but the ocean side pools didn't appear to be being monitored. I did see a guy one day with a shirt that said security on it walking about. I'm not exactly what he was securing or watching for, he just looked like a slob who just happened to have a shirt that said security!", "user": "Tiffany Q", "date": "July 8, 2013", "id": 166782559}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great resort", "text": "We were in room 848. The rooms do have the basic kitchen supplies you need. The air conditioning worked fine. The bed was fine. Seating in the room was fine. But again, the appearance was run down.

There is also no place to hang your wet clothes. There was one hook in the bathroom right above the toilet paper... guess what, put a wet swim suit there, wet paper! Carpet was dirty.

The rooms at first glance appear to be fine ... but a closer look tells you that they need some TLC. The drywall around the bathroom door jamb was water damaged, paint was peeling from the textured ceiling, and housekeeping seemed to just do an average job with vacuuming (crumbs on the carpeting). Our kids enjoyed the pools (indoor and outdoor) and the lazy river, but I'm not sure a lot of attention is given to the cleanliness of them. Front desk staff was OK, but not very knowledgeable. For example, I asked them for a recommendation of a restaurant close by that was kid-friendly and all they did was hand me a map. I guess that's the role of a concierge, but the resort did not appear to have one.

The man at the front desk was not the friendliest person to deal with either. The wait for an elevator after 15 minutes was a little much and using the stairs wasn't an option as we had a stroller and 9 floors was just too much. The room was ok... Not the cleanest by any means... But I always bring my own cleaning supplies, so it was ok !! The view was great. The kids had a great time in the pools, but the staff all seem to be miserable with their jobs !! I had read reviews about the cars being vandalized in the parking building and the gentleman at the front desk confirmed, that yes, it has happened !!!
