I chose the hotel because of its location and historical significance and at \u00a375 I was expecting to be a little bit impressed. Room 6 was a very small room at the very back of the hotel away the historical part of the bulding. It was on the ground floor with very little light and the bathroom was very cramped and uncomfortable. I feel that, as a solo traveller, there are many B&Bs in Lyme Regis that give you much better surroundings and charge less (and are friendlier). I was also treated very rudely by a barman for having the 'cheek' to order a latte at the bar 15 minutes after closing time. Even when I explained I was a resident he just looked at me coldly and said \"bar's closed\". This is far removed from the comment on the back of the hotel brochure which declares \"You won't get a better welcome\". The barman's nastiness coloured my whole expererience of staying at the hotel.

Lyme Regis is a picturesque town on the West Dorset border, part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage site. Steeped in history, it is renowned for its fascinating past, mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, the unique fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, and for being the central location of the novel and the 1981 film, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman'. Situated less than 100 metres from the sea, the Royal Lion Hotel is a perfect base from which to explore the locale. Built in 1601 as a coaching inn, the Hotel has been extensively refurbished, yet still retains much of its history and unique charm. Oak beams, wood panelling and open fires help to create a warm, welcoming and comfortable atmosphere, with new additions of its own swimming pool and other facilities. Wi-Fi, although not available in the bedrooms, is available to guests in several areas of the hotel. Privately owned and managed, the Royal Lion Hotel has gained an enviable reputation for its friendly service, world class food and wine and leisure offerings."}
