Lexington and E 57th has a lot going on around it without the tourist bustle of Times Square, The 57 is also much less expensive than the Times Square location. That being said, the rooms are far smaller at the 57. We were both traveling with our 16 year old sons. It was a little cramped. However, for two women it would have been fine. The hotel is very clean, chic decor and the staff was helpful and professional. My companion travels for business frequently and has accrued a high status in the Marriott Reward club, hence we enjoyed a complimentary breakfast buffet consisting of cereal, yogurt, fruit, bagels, toast, scrambled eggs, warm oatmeal, juice and coffee. The buffet was served in a comfortable private lounge with television. We were also treated to one appetizer off of the menu after 5:00pm the evening before.

Sadly, this hotel fell short for me in all regards except for the location...that I will say is excellent. It is located close to midtown, Central Park and all the shopping you could hope for. However, the rest of the stay was disappointing. When we arrived at 9pm there was no bellman anywhere. We had driven into the city and needed to valet park. I had to go into the hotel while my husband waited in the car and find someone who could help with parking. I certainly expect that a hotel that charges the prices they do and says they are a 4 star hotel would at least have a bellman. (especially in NYC). This happened both nights we were there. I will say I did see a doorman/bellman there during the day on occasion, but why would there not be anyone at night? The room itself was small, but that's expected in NYC. We had a superior room so it was larger than the regular rooms and it was still small. The decor is tired and dated, definitely could use a remodel. The best part of the room was the bathroom...fairly spacious and nice.
