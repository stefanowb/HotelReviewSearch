We could just sit on the balcony and stare at the lake and the pool below us. We went shopping around the corner at the new boutique style shopping center. We drove down the main road about 15 minutes and were at the Portland aerial tram. Took it to top for a great view of Portland. Two more minutes down the same road & we were on the Willamette River looking at all the bridges in Portland. There is a new section along the river with shops and restaurants where we ate lunch. Then back home to the Lakeshore Inn for recommendations for dinner. We ate at the only one right on the lake. Since it was a gorgeous day everyone was outside on the deck. Great food & service. The area around the lake is surrounded by expensive private homes with the exception of the Inn, restaurant, & a corner of the shopping center. Only drawback was the continental breakfast.
