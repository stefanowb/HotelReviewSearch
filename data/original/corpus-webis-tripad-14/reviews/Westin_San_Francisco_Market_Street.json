Suddenly, a smoking room became available. As this was also unacceptable, we asked that they at least waive the high $42 parking fee if we had to wait, since we technically had paid for the room since 3pm. When we asked for the manager, a non-smoking room miraculously became available. No apology or explanation. Needless to say, we were not happy with the service, even if we eventually got a decent room with some serious prodding. On the plus side, the daytime front desk staff, housekeeping, and valet were very nice. The night desk clerk and manager seemed to needed some training in customer service.
