The hotel could use some upgrades. Nevertheless it's a no frills stay. We only used it to cook, shower and sleep, majority of our time was spent at the beach which was ~2 blocks away. There was no remote control but if you call downstairs, they will bring you one. Our kitchen had the basic cooking utensils but didn't have a blender or coffee maker and no scissors! Also, there's no laundry room in the building which I was lead to believe otherwise. There are local laundromats nearby but it's quite pricey. The supermarket to go to is Continente - it's in a mall and there's everything there (it's like a smaller version of a walmart or target back in the states but with plenty of fresh food). The wine section there is very good and the store is very organized and they also take credit cards which the nearby supermarkets don't accept credit cards that are not from portugal.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 2, 2010", "id": 66245350}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The resort did not seem busy at all while we were there.
