Though described as close to Orchard Road and the malls, it is 20 mins walk to top end of Orchard Road and same distance to the metro station - not good in 32 degree heat. it is attached to a small mall which is ok, but be aware that if you stay here to shop (as we did) it is a long way to the better malls on the Orchard Road. It's also a long way to the main sights in the colonial district, the marina, chinatown, little india etc, though taxis are cheap (unless you want a 20 minute sweaty walk to the metro). No decent restaurants or hawker centres nearby (fast food only in the mall) and the hotel's chinese restaurant is about the best there is in the area. We asked for a no smoking room and though the whole floor was supposed to be non smoking, the room stank of cigarette smoke, though reception quickly and efficiently moved us to another room. The whole hotel smells damp and musty though. On our first trip to Singapore we stayed at the Scarlet in Chinatown which was similar price but 5 star standard. Though there is a business centre for access to PCs, it has restricted opening hours, and though advertised in room as open at 8am, doesn't open until 10am - again staff were very good and opened it up for us to check in on-line and print our boarding passes, and also to assist another guest who was there on business and not happy about lack of facilities.", "title": "Traders Club service was very disappointing", "user": "211traveler", "date": "September 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 40115004}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled on business", "text": "This is my first time staying at the Traders chain (have stayed at several Shangrila's with good experiences) and since this was a busy business trip, I figured I would not get to enjoy the hotel as much and the Singapore Shangrila is a bit out of the way. I must say i was rather disappointed with their service, especially since I chose to stay in the Traders Club, which was advertised as to have \"a higher standard of accommodation, personalised service and a host of special privileges and amenities\" for the frequent traveler (quote from their website). The hotel appeared aged but rooms--smaller than expected--were generally well kept up; location not central on Orchard road but fit my purpose. To make a long story short, on Day2 of my 4D stay, my room had a leak that was not fixable and I had to move--not once but 3 times (I forget!) since I had some specific requests--THAT'S why I chose the more expensive Traders Club rooms instead of one of their regular rooms!! So after spending about 1-2h repacking and moving around and re-unpacking, you would think that the hotel would be bending over backwards to apologize for this. Yes, I did get a phone call from the manager to apologize for the inconvenience, but that was IT.... Nothing special or 'personalized' about the service!! To be fair, the quality of the food (bkft & evening cocktails) was quite good, but the service was definitely disappointing, especially given that this was Traders Club, especially given that this was Singapore, service city of the world as they like to think.
