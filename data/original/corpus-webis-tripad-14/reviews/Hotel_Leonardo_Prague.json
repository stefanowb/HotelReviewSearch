The hotel is built up in in a historical building, so room sizes and layouts differ. Ours was very roomy facing the inside courtyard and very quiet (no street noise) Room 259. FREE WIFI all over the hotel is much appreciated as was breakfast each morning. Breakfast was varied and delish. And the service manager was always there to insure that nothing ran out and that everyone's needs were met. I appreciated his diligence. We did eat dinner in the restaurant one evening and that was good too. The Hotel is a short walk from the Charles Bridge and all of the Old City.

The bath towels are very small and very thin. There were two of us is the room - and we did have to call for extra towels (easily received) each nite. The lotions and potions are screwed into the sink and shower walls in large pump versions. This is probably a great savings for the hotel, but awkward to use. Also there is no hair conditioner. I had \"words\" with the waiter at dinner. He wanted cash for a glass of wine instead of my signing for it. And when he did bring me the check he sternly told me to \"put my correct room number on the check\". I did not order a second glass of wine. When I mentioned it to the front desk when paying I was told yes, he had heard about the incident, but the facts were inconclusive.
