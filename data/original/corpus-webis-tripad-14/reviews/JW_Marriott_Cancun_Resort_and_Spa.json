My husband and I thought our stay was just wonderful. We loved the adult pool at the JW and picked the same spot everyday to relax with a beautiful view of the ocean and it was nice and quiet. We loved how it was connected to the Casa Magna which gave us an excellent choice of restaurants. The food was just wonderful at all the restaurants that we ate at. Our favorite was the Thai and we loved the steak house. The staff was very friendly and courteous all of the time. The hotel was in a great location and was far enough away from the busy part of Cancun but close enough to walk to other restaurants.

I really do not understand how people can complain about this hotel. I read many reviews before going and when I arrived I kept them in mind to look for things that were relevant in their arguments. People say it has a rocky beach, but when you walk down the strip of beach in the hotel zone the JW's is the cleanest with absolutely zero rocks. People said the lawn chairs were old, but they had very comfortable cushions on them and were cleaned daily. I actually had no idea lawn chairs could be so comfortable. A recent review even said that he did not have room to swim if he wanted to do a 100 meter lap. The pool is well over 100 meters long, and they have a indoor work out pool in the spa. If you read reviews with negative remarks trust me people are just being picky. The only negative review that I found stood out was the price of drinks and food. If you go to Cancun do not exchange American money for pesos. American money has much more wait, the exchange rate is not worth it. Their trick is that they give you change in pesos, so bring a wide variety of U.S bills and try to pay with exact change.

I have stayed at numerous JW Marriott's and this one had the best service (tough challenge as they all have been good). The room was spacious and seated on the balcony chairs you could see the ocean. The grounds and pools were beautiful. The beach area for all the hotels in the hotel zone is narrow because of erosion and I understand from the locals that Cancun is seriously considering bring in sand. We did not rent a car as it is easy to book day tours from Cancun. An advantage of a tour bus/van as opposed to a rental car is that you are not stopped by the police. Check points are common to stop drug trafficking. We took 2 tours on Cancun Line (Cancun.com). I strongly recommend them - the tour guides were excellent, they were on time, buses and drivers were good. We paid $10 extra for the best bus with a host and were very pleased. We went to Chichen Itza and Tulum (neither to be missed). We also strongy recommend the Selvatica Adventure -zipline, bicycle, cenote - it was a blast and the staff were superb. Xel Ha is also well worth a trip. We especially liked 2 restaurants - La Distilleria across from the Kukulcan Shopping Center - excellent margaritas and food for the price. We also really like the La Capilla Argentine Steakhouse at the Casa Magna Marriott next door. The Champions Sport BAr at the Casa Magna had the worst service known to mankind. We went there twice - skip it. Of course, the spa was excellent and I tried two treatments. The Mayan body scrup combined with massage was well worth it. Not as happy with the pumpkin facial. Fitness equipment solid. December weather was nice - a little overcast - but that was great for us because it was not has hot as it could be.
