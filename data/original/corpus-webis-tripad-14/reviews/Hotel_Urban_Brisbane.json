I paid around $100 CDN a night for this hotel. It was the best rate I could get for a fairly decent centrally located hotel. Compared to other hotels that I have stayed in other cities I would rate the value of this hotel at around $60 per night. Although the hotel is in a good location the hotel rooms need to be updated and the hallways are dark and unattractive. There is also no deadbolt on your room door which as a solo female traveller made me nervous.", "user": "TLM29", "date": "June 19, 2007", "id": 7935463}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Real ales found!", "text": "For a three star this did not compare to the the same rated Golden Sands we stopped over in Dubai.

The lounge, bar and dining areas are of a much better standard than the rooms themselves. The staff were very helpful and courteous. The Hotel is situated at the top of a steep climb out of the Main shopping area and Roma st station.
