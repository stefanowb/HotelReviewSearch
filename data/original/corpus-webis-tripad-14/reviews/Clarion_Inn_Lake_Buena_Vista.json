The signs said not to park up by the check in drive thru area, so we parked and went in. Inside we went up to a lady at the counter. She informed us breakfast was until 1030. She then told us our room (5th floor which when outside the room you see the pool below). She then made a nice big circle for the elevators for us to take to get to the room. So..we arrived at the elevators. Elevator 1- read a sign \"out of order\". We looked at elevator 2 right next to it-it read \"out of order.\" We ended up looking around the hotel for another elevator-and found one at the end of the hotel building that worked. Why couldnt the front desk have told us that? As for the room, the toilet ran all night and wouldnt flush, the sink faucet had a messed up handle that you couldnt control what temperature the water would come out at, and at some points whether the water would even stop comin out of the faucet. We called the 2nd night at 11 pm to fix these (we went straight to be dthe 1st night, and was out all day until 11 the next day). The people we called COULD NOT speak good english! when i was trying to explain the toilet was running, they thought i was trying to tell them i wanted a wake up call!. I did get them straightened out before i hung up the phone. They said the would have someone up right away. An hour later i called again and again they said they would have someone right up.

Have there chicken noodle soup it is delicious.You will also see lots of other stores along the road especially if when you come out of vineland avenue and turn right, you will come across the crossroads shopping complex and other stores.We went on one trip and that was to clearwater beach go if you can it is stunning and put on lots of suncream.When we walked about, we felt quite safe and we did walk from downtown disney back to the hotel one day during the day it took us about 40 mins, we don't drive so we got about on foot or the occasional taxi. From the hotel you can see the outlet stores like nike ,addias,levi etc but that is across the I-4 so a taxi is a must cost us for 6 people about $11 lots of great shopping and the shops are open until 11 o'clock. If you do decide on this hotel request a room away from the interstate because it is noisy the traffic are non stop night and day.Florida is a great place and lovely people the parks fantastic even for older people ,my dad came, he was 70 and he loved evey minute and all my children are adults so you don't have to be young to enjoy disney.
