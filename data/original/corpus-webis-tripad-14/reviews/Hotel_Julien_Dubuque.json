It was so loud, in fact, that I was unable to hear the tv in my room over the loud music. They did offer to move us the 2nd time we call but it was already almost midnight and we figured why bother. We informed the front desk that they should be letting guests know that room 325 was going to be a rap party. We were cool with the no window thing but the noise was crazy and I wouldn't have bothered commenting except that the price point on this place was higher than most and I expected more out of a top tier type of hotel.
