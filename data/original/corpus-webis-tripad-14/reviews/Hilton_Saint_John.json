I had last stayed at this hotel seven years ago and since then, the hotel has received remodelling inside and out. In my opinion, the hotel remains one of the best accommodations in the city as it is located in the uptown area and many of the rooms overlook the harbour. The room is a typical hotel room though the newer d\u00e9cor gives the room a \u201cmodern/trendy\u201d feel with the use of dark woods and draperies. A clean bed offers a very nice sleep with plenty of non-allergenic feather pillows and a thick, warm duvet. The hotel offers in-room internet access and features a good size flat screen television. Each room has an in-room safe, iron & iron board and coffee maker. The bathroom is bright and most of the fixtures are new. The bathroom in my room did not offer a hair dryer. However, despite the attempts to modernize the rooms, there is d\u00e9cor left over from the old room design, such as Stucco ceiling and outdated shower controls. Regardless, the room was very clean and comfortable. With onsite amenities: guest can park their car in the underground parking, a recommendation during winter months. The hotel offers a fitness room though it may be tight during peak times. The hotel is one of two hotels situated on the Pedwalk System, which means guest can walk miles without ever having to step outdoors. Also, on the Pedwalk System are countless shops and restaurants as well as Harbour Station, the New Brunswick Museum, the Saint John Regional Library and, perhaps the city\u2019s best attraction, the City Market. In the end, the Hilton Saint John is clean and centrally located, and one of the best choices in the City of Saint John.", "title": "View The Harbour From Your Bed", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "January 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 92880992}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a great New Year's Eve stay at the Hilton, our first time there.
