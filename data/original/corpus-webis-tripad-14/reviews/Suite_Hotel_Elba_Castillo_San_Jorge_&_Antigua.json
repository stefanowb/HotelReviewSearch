There are two main pools, a \"noisy\" one full of kids where the towls went down at 6 in the morning and a quiet one where we never had a problem getting a lounger.

We sat out there every morning having our breakfast as that was when the sun was on it, rather than in the late afternoon. The apartment was very spacious, no problems with that, but it is a bit tired and could do with a refurb. The TV very old, the wooden piece of furniture it was on was dilapidated. The doors to the balcony had some black tape on one of the windows, presumably to hold the glass in. The windows in the bathroom had tissue paper stuffed in them too. There were two rings for cooking which we didnt use, toaster and kettle, microwave and fridge. Worth getting an Elba card before you go as you get given 2 bottles of beer, water and ans of coke as a welcome gift put in the fridge. Apartment was kept clean and towels replaced. The pool was freezing cold! Some of the sunbeds seemed to collapse on people (we saw two people literally sit down and fall through them!) but ours were ok and there were plenty to use. The pool in the middle of the hotel didnt get as much sun as the other one by the sea but perhaps it's different at other times of the year. It was 20 euros for the safe for a week (plus 10 euros deposit) which seemed expensive to me, but whilst there we heard from other guests that some rooms had been broken into over the new year period so clearly it's worthwhile paying for the safe. Mind you we were also told that someone stole an entire safe from a room so don't know what to make of that! We wanted to upgrade to half board while we were there and the offer was that you could do that for 15 euros per day. We went to the reception in the evening to ask if this was possible to do for a day and was told this was fine, we should go back in the morning so that the breakfast would start from then. When we went back in the morning we were told it would cost 20 euros not 15. When we asked why, we were told that to get the rate of 15 per day you had to have 3 days worth of upgrade not just one. That was fine, we said we would do 3 days - Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and was then told we couldn't do that either! It had to be 3 consecutive days (which we didnt want to do as we were meeting friends for dinner in between for my birthday). I said what difference does it make that its not 3 consecutive days, surely having someone upgrade for 3 days is better than none at all? The reception manager said she understood but they were the rules from head office and she wouldn't budge. Therefore we didn't upgrade at all, Makes no business sense to create obstacles to customer satisfaction when we probably would've bought more drinks there too, what a daft 'rule' to have. I also pointed out to the manager that it does not say this on the bit of paper advertising the upgrade rates to which she shrugged her shoulders. In the end we made the most of some local restaurants where we had lovely food so glad we didn't bother! The location is good, about 10 minute walk to the centre. The resort itself is not the busiest in January but plenty going on, especially at Pieros and Hemmingways bar. We still managed some very late nights! Lovely to walk all the way along the beach. Recommend Fado Rock, le Patio, 15 restaurants and Slow Boat for great meal for jsut 6.50 euros. Would go back to Fuerteventura but probably try Correlejo next time.
