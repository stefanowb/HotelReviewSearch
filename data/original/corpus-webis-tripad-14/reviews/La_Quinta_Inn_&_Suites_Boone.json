We won't be back. Oh, the staff is terrific. Friendly. Smiling. Cheerful greetings. No complaints there. They had nothing to do with the construction of this property. We were on the second/middle floor and felt like we were in a noise sandwich. Loud sounds and noise from both sides, above and outside in the early hours of the morning. Not what was needed on a get away weekend. Also, room has a nice sofa but no side tables. No lamps, not even a floor lamp. And I have to admit I have come to expect flat screen TVs in hotel rooms, not old CRT TVs.

We were glad to find a hotel that was pet friendly in the area. We enjoyed the decor of the hotel which made it feel more like a log cabin than a traditional hotel. I was also impressed by the professionalism and caring attitude of the staff. Our reservations were originally for two days but we had to leave one day early. It was past the time they gave me to cancel the reservation for the next day but they waived the second night fee anyway. This is how to build customer loyalty. You don't expect to find a caring understanding attitude from the staff at this level of a hotel. I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton and some other high end hotels and I found the attitude of the staff on par with these higher end hotels.

This was my first stay at a La Quinta and was very pleased. Pros: Bed AND Pillows were like nothing I've experienced at other chain hotels. My partner (who brings his own pillows) wanted to take one home! Thankfully, he didn't, but if the hotel reads this, we'd love to know the brand so we can purchase! We did not use the pool or any of the amenities. The breakfast is limited, but we did enjoy coffee, cereal, apples, and oatmeal (pretty much the basics). We still went out for breakfast that morning. Location was easy to find (Corner of 421 and 105). Cons: Parking. The lot is shared with the Sleep Inn and it's challenging to say the least if you arrive at an off time like we did.
