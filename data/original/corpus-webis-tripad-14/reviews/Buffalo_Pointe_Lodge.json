Greg and Stef were great hosts and the full breakfast included in the price cannot be beat - waffles, pancakes, eggs plus they brought out plates of cut fresh fruit. Day 1 we went on the Grand Canyon Railroad which I highly recommend. Day 2 we went to the Canyon on our own and took the Desert View Drive and came back through Flagstaff where we stopped at Wupatki Sunset Crater Volcano (a totally different scene than the canyon). We went to Black Bart's for dinner and the show. You have to visit the little shops in Williams with all the Historic Route 66 memorabilia. Had to stop at the old fashioned ice cream shop, Twisters to cap off the day.
