We arrived in Madrid early morning and got the Metro from airport to right outside the building (2 changes) we couldn't believe our luck how easy it was to find. We had arrived before the check in time but this was no problem as we left our cases at reception and headed off for complementary breakfast as she had given us vouchers for the Caf\u00e9 & Te opposite. On our return our cases had been moved into our room and we were over the moon with effort that had been put into making our room extra special with 2 love swans made out of our towels with chocolates and sweets. We had booked a small double with city view (room 9) the room was ample and the view was amazing from the balcony on to Gran Via. The room was red hot as radiator was up full but as us Brits are use to cooler weather in Dec we found it was to much for us so turned it off. The room was spotless and kept to high standard. The bathroom was ultra modern and stocked with lovely toiletries.", "title": "Go Inn Madrid", "user": "Ozlem I", "date": "November 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185830897}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Community of Madrid", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Madrid"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 7}, "aka": "Hostal Orly Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0538116591928}
