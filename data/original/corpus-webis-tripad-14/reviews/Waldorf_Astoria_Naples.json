The room had a lovely view of the Gulf of Mexico and was very clean, and we enjoyed the fruit basket and complimentary wine upon check-in. The Golden Door Spa, which is on-site, was very pleasant and we took advantage of the $99 summer massage specials. With the spa service, we had access to the entire spa faciltiy for the entire day which frankly was more enjoyable than the massage. The privacy we enjoyed away from the crowded hotel pool was nice.

The food was so-so in Aura, where the breakfast buffet was served, but the kind and attentive service made up for it. The wait staff truly were excellent; the best service we've had in a very long time. Kuddos to them. And to all the staff there, frankly. From the bar tenders to the housekeeping staff - everyone was so kind. While we agreed to pay it, the $27/day resort fee is a little hard to swallow.
