The staff is lovely here, extremely helpful and we put them to work. The concierge helped us out a lot and was really nice and even receptive to taking some tips from us on places she didn't already know about (i.e. Oliva Restaurant). The business center offered free internet in a great setting with people watching while you are there and free bottled water all around the hotel, a fantastic feature that we so appreciated. The breakfast was good and in a very tranquil and lovely space looking over a small green courtyard, and we actually got to eat outside the last day which is always a treat for me. English newpapers as well, also a nice touch that we didn't see many other places on our vacation. The gym was decent and we used it, nice big screen tv in there while you work out.

Situated on a calm street just behind the Kotva dept store and next to a police station, from the minute you walk in staff are friendly and attentive. The hotel's decor is modern, minimalist but practical. Once you are checked in and your room is ready, a member of staff gives you a quick guided tour of the facilities which include a 24 hour business centre (free internet access), a beautiful courtyard garden between the two buildings that make up the hotel, a breakfast room which overlooks this, and a gym (which we didn't use - no need for extra exercise when you are pounding the streets in 100 degree sun!). Our room was a superior room in the Orange House. It did have a separate glass walk-in shower but this was not 'see-through' as depicted in the hotel website. Water did leak out from the shower which did soak some of the towels and the toiletries were not the Aveda products they advertise on their site. However, the bathroom was clean and looked good. The room itself was a pretty good size. The bed was king-size and the room overlooked the courtyard so there was no noise to speak of. On the outside of the windows are electrically operated sun shades which you can lower and raise to your hearts content. Superior rooms come with free DVD rental from their video library although we were initially mistakenly charged for this. They are quick to fix such problems like this and the fact that our room was not serviced one day. Normally there is a turn-down service and fresh bottles of water provided. Plenty of good restaurants in the surrounding streets and it seemed a safe area to walk around - never saw one drunk. Breakfast is expensive - 500 crowns - and was not included in our hotels.com package so watch out for that. The breakfast itself is excellent though with lots of fresh fruits and items cooked to order. Staff speak good English. To sum up - the Hotel Josef is a good hotel for the price, very service-orientated in a city where that is sorely missing still, good location, quiet, helpful and relatively luxurious. 4/5", "title": "Super stay at Josef", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "StevenAllen", "date": "July 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8035168}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "Hotel Josef is incredibly modern.
