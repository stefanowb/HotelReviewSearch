The king suite was super clean, stylish and loaded with amenities, true hd channels, granite, wood, stocked kitchen. The breakfast eggs tasted like eggs, unlike many hotel chains. The breakfast had plenty of choices in a unique mod dining area. I generally use Holiday express and Comfort suites, which I really like, but this is a notch up.

The room was very clean with plenty of room to spread out. The hotel can be a little difficult to find as it is off the road and behind an office park. This does mean it is quiet. There are plenty of food options within walking and easy driving distance. The breakfast buffet was very tasty. Check in was quick and easy. All and all a nice hotel.", "user": "FJOP", "date": "March 2, 2012", "id": 125528876}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful hotel in quiet location!", "text": "Decided to stay here because we love Residence Inn hotels. This was was by far the best we've ever stayed in! I'm not sure how new this hotel is but it looked brand new and it was very clean! Full breakfast was once again a hit for our family of 4! In a quiet location but close to restaurants! Stayed here for a night before we left for our cruise the following day. It was about an hour drive to the Port of New Orleans. Definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again!", "user": "kcmogreggs", "date": "February 7, 2012", "id": 124273744}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very comfortable", "text": "My wife and I stayed here for a mini \"get away\" and we enjoyed it.

It was spacious, clean, quiet and very comfortable. It is a huge improvement over the other area hotels. Being well off the busy Covington roads is a huge plus. Excellent restaurants are available nearby.
