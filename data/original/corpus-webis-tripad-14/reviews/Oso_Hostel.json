By 9pm we were so agitated by the heat that we asked the reception if there was anything else we could do to cool the room down, she took us to another room which was much cooler to collect a second fan for our room. We were only there for one night so why they didn't see the sense in moving us to the empty, cooler room I have no idea. We had even hinted that it would be a much cooler room to sleep in!", "title": "Basic hostel but good for a stop-over on the way to Yosemite", "user": "meanderingcailin", "date": "June 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 163137689}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Groveland"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 6, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 5}, "slim_ranking": 0.307692307692}
