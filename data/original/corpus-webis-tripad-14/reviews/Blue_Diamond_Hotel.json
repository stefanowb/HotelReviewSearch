We just walked to all the tourist spots in the City and the Ben Tanh market. Our room was clean, specially the bathroom. Our towels were thick and fairly new. They were changed every day, so I don't understand why some reviewers were complaining about threadbare towels. I almost brought my own but didn't want them eating into my shopping space. Disposable toothbrushes and bottles of mineral water were given every day. Two thumbs up. We arrived at 11 am which is way before check in time. We were lucky though as there was a room immediately available. I was so thankful for that because my hubby wasn't feeling too good after the plane ride. Service was always with a smile. Breakfast was ok. Hubby loved the very tasty porridge. I specially loved the cable tv. As both of us weren't feeling too good, we spent a lot of time in the room watching movies.

They were not helpful and were not very warm towards us and our questions. It was a little odd considering most hotels we stayed in, in Vietnam had wonderful customer service and were more than willing to help.

My main complaints were the poor quality of the towels, the low water pressure, the construction happening in the room next to ours that started in the morning and the sad excuse for a morning buffet (the quality of the food was poor and if you did not get there early enough, you would miss out on the more appealing dishes).

The beds were comfortable, but a \"double\" was really two twins pushed together and I believe that was the case for every room (I peeked in a couple of them when the maids were cleaning).
