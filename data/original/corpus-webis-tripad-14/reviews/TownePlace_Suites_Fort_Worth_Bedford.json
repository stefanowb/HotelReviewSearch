He did not give us any of the 3 discounts that we normally get from the Marriott properties and said it was because we went through a \"3rd\" party service. The room smelled like a wet dog and I was given a can of Febreeze. The smell never went away and we continually had to open the one window that worked every time we entered the room to air the room out. Breakfast typically for a different chain of hotels, but not this chain as we are customed to. We had maid service to our room in the middle of the week and the linen was not changed. That was a new one on me as the Marriott used to be a clean environment. Hot tub??? There were roaches crawling around the area and after I let out a loud scream that would wake the hotel members, the manager never stepped out to see what was going on. The rest of the stay I was terrified of the roaches and afraid they would get into my car.

Upon check-in, I was told I was reserved for two rooms being they did not a have my 2 double bedroom as I had reserved. I had made a reservation for a 2 queen bedroom for my husband and 5 year old son. There was no need for an additional room for the 3 of us so I declined the additional one. My 5 year old normally gets his own bed, so he had to sleep on the sofa bed. Not a big issue, but being that it was an uncomfortable sofa bed, as most of them are, he managed to have restful nights. I'm sure I paid for a 2 bedroom price for the 1 bedroom room we received, no big deal, but the hotel should of at least stated in full details there was an issue with my reservation in the email.
