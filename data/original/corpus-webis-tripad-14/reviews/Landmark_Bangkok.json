There were various shops including a tailor, none of which we used. Our non smoking room was large, 2 queen beds (only used one but it was VERY comfortable and masses of space, luxurious and the bathroom terrific. Only hotel we stayed in on a 2 month trip that had a separate shower and bath. Fluffy bathrobes and a turn down service, fruit platter appeared twice-I\u2019m afraid we didn\u2019t eat any of it. We were on the run most of the time. We had breakfast included (AUD$160.00pn on [----]) and for some reason we were on the lower restaurant for that, got turned away from ground floor 1st day. Not that I had any complaints, the buffet was terrific- Western and Asian food, plus eggs cooked as you like made my husband particularly happy. We had dinner in the Pub one night and also buffet lunch in the upstairs restaurant the day we left because of time constraints for our mate. All were excellent. We didn\u2019t have time for the pool or gym so cannot comment on those. From the smiling girl who opened the door to the helpful guys who loaded our bags in the cab when we left the staff could not have been better. Location is excellent, just 5 minutes to the Nana sky train station.

They were excellent by the way . We had 2 stints at the Landmark . 2 nights at the start of our holiday then 10 days in Koh Samui and then 1 night at the end of the holiday.By far the best way to do it. This was our first trip to Thailand and our welcome at the Landmark was lovely .As a previous advisor mentioned it is well worth upgrading for the money to a club room. It cost us an extra $50 a room and with that you get late check out , use of a 24 hour bar, 2 hours of free cocktails and snacks on the 27th floor and 3 free items of cleaning, as well as a few other things. The rooms are lovely and although someone said it was like Antartica I dont agree , the Air con was excellent .Its very humid heat out there and its easier putting a quilt over you than being in a hot stuffy room.Everything connected to the hotel is worth a try too. the Huntsman pub in the basement did nice food, was cool and for the lads showed the footy and the noodle bar next door to the hotel name a couple. Its well positioned for everything too. e.g. the street market opposite , its right next to the skytrain and around the corner from a very good tailors called Raja's fashions on Soi 4. Although the tailor Rajawongse 2 doors up is supposed to be good too. The only thing I would say about the hotel if there was something to be a little negative about it , (but as you see I still give the hotel an excellent rating) is the hotel limousine service. Which was really expensive compared to others, okay still cheap compared to UK prices. I suggest you try to get a driver that is reliable at the airport when you land .They normally stand around exit 3 or 4 on the second or third levelsand use them for your stay there , we had an executive minibus/van on our first visit and you should get these for 800-1200 baht depending on the size of your party I think(dont forget to haggle, they will quote you alot more expensive than that ). . But we were fortunate to get a really great driver at the airport and used him a few times over our second stint there, he had a seven seater Toyota.. To give you some idea he charged us 800 baht for the Hotel to Airport trip and we gave him 200 baht as a tip. Compared to 2500 baht for a limo from the hotel. Enjoy your stay!I may just put his info on a forum page as he desrves more business. He spoke fairly good English ,was always punctual and knowledgable and as I said reasonable too.", "title": "Fantastic hotel!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Greg C", "date": "October 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6013713, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 quality", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "Excellent hotel.

The suite was immaculate and we had great fun playing with the control console which allowed you to play music while in the bath and set the exact temperature you required! The entrance lobby is stunning and the pool area offers interesting views over the city. The hotel is located on the Sukhumvit road which is a little bit away from the main attractions such as the temple of the Emerald Buddha, but the sheer luxuriousness and value for money of the hotel makes up for it.
