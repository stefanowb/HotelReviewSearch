You check in at a simple desk next to the restaurant. Suitcases you have to bring up yourself with a small elevator. Because we needed an extra bed for our son, we booked the hammock room which was spacious with large windows. There is a hammock in the middle of the room which was appreciated by our son but I did not see the additional benefit. Bathroom is actually a box with a shower inside and a washbasin on the outside. Separate toilet. Because the glass door of the shower is also the bathroom door, the carpet in your room gets wet when you shower. The room has all necessities, text is all in the style of the website. Funky. No fridge or minibar, no bathtub. But fluffy towels and superb duvets covered in crispy linen covers. Absolutely heavenly. When lying underneath the duvet you could not look over, that's how big and fluffy the duvet was. I loved it.

First impressions were good even though we had to change room due to a faulty shower. The room laked some basics I felt. Not enough hanging space for clothes, no shower caps, no tea/coffee making facility and the sink was tiny. There was a lack of surfaces to leave stuff on which meant we ended up using the wall along the window for some toiletries and make-up. The problem was some items fell off the wall towards the window and were very difficult to retrieve. Because of the amount of glass the room became very hot and didn't cool down until the early hours. Also you had to tell in advance if you wanted the buffet breakfast the next day in order to avail of the residents rate. Why? Its a buffet! A one night stay would have been enough.
