We got a superior room with terrace for 50 euros and took half board for 19 euros each. It is in a beautiful setting with well tended grounds. Reception was efficient and our room was modern and pleasant with a good sized en suite. The restaurant closes for dinner in the quiet seaon, but the hotel serves dinner in the \"cafeteria\" which was more snug and much better when only about 6 tables are occupied. The set menu dinner gave plenty of choice and was tasty and well cooked. Breakfast was also good and bacon and eggs were on offer. There is a very pleasant English lady serving here and in the cafeteria at lunchtime who could not be more friendly or helpful. She directed us to a walk through the grounds and over the nearby hills to Aledo which was beautiful. I have stayed in many paradors and this compares favourably with most of them. The setting is excellent, the views sublime and the service quietly efficient.

Although outside was chilly during the night, the room temperature is nice warm. The room was simple but very clean. We had a room with terrace. The view from our terrace was stunning. I think if you would like to book a room here, the rooms with terrace are certainly certainly worth for money. We had diner and breakfast in the restaurant. Both were excellent. The vegetable paella was very delicious, rich and soft. The staff were very friendly too. This hotel is certainly recommended if you are planning to visit the beautiful Sierra Espu\u00f1a.

We ate in the restaurant, went for the set menu and were both slightly disappointed with the food but it wasnt expensive. You could also eat outside on the terrace or the cafe which served tapas and sandwiches. The breakfast in the morning is in the cafe they will cook you anything you want but there was also all the normal fruit, toast, cereal etc, we sat outside on the terrace and ate ours and it was perfect.
