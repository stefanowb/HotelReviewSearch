WIFI is free in the rooms, buffet breakfast is included in the price and has a large choice, and the country club was nice, it's good with warm weather as there is a large outdoor swimming pool which my child loved. There are large grounds and other swimming pools, slides and a playground. So, I think this is a pretty good all round hotel. I would stay again.", "title": "One Year Later and Still No Better....
