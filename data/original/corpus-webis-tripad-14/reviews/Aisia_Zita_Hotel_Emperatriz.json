Leikitio is a small Basque summer seaside town, which I am sure not very many tourists from other countries find themselves. The Zita dominates the beach and is a modern, but very grand building, with many rooms offering sea views. The common areas are very beautiful but the rooms themselves are disappointing - twin beds pushed together in double rooms and bathrooms which are way past their best. There is a small thermal spa in the basement with a tiny jacuzzi and a thermal pool, but again, it is all faded glamour, the spa clearly hasn't been done up for years and it is a far cry from sparkling spas in most hotels nowadays. Staff are friendly and breakfasts are fine.

You could say the hallway carpets could use a good shampooing, but otherwise the guest rooms were simple but stately.
