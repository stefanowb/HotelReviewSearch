The setting for the Radisson is absolutely gorgeous, though it is quite far from the old town of Dubrovnik, necessitating travel by bus, ferry, or in our case, rental car. The 2 bedroom apartment was nicely equipped and allowed us to cook dinner in the apartment each evening. The main problem, especially when we first arrived, was the very poor service. It seems that the staff's favorite phrase was \"Not possible\" (even for requests that would be easily accommodated at any basic motel). Examples include requests for ice, clean towels, a coffee maker for the room.

Apparently, the staff missed the corporate video on the \"Yes We Can!\" customer service model. The phrase we hear most is \"No, Not Possible\". Can we have a coffee maker in our apartment (the hotel was almost empty, there were probably about 300 available)? No, not possible. Can we have some soap for the dishwasher? No, not possible. We didn't get maid service the first day. The second day, the maid came and decamped with all of our towels, even the ones we left hanging as per the instructions to indicate that we would use them again. It took two calls to the front desk to get some more. We have to ask every night at the front desk for them to turn on the area lights around the building, so that we don't accidently fall down the darkened stairwell. During our stay, maintenance wanted to install room safes and an evacuation plan. When my sister and her husband tried to check in, they told her that \"No, not possible\" since our two bedroom suite with a sofa-bed only accomodated two people (3 of which had already checked in). She was finally allowed to go to the room, after leaving her passport and told to come back in 30 minutes so that she could be reported to the police (direct quote still don't know what that means.) I can go on but hope this is enough for some Radisson Blu executive out there to make an emergency phone call to Croatia. I am not trying to be mean or petty here - the facilities are new and beautiful and I would love to return to a place that is not marred by such poor service.
