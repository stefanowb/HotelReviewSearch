Would not stay here again. Was first booked into a horrible smoking room. Will say that the staff accomodated my request to change rooms, so that was appreciated. No AC, only a few TV channels (no news), elevator worked sometimes, bathroom had mildew, bed was tiny for two people--suggest you get twin beds, might be more comfortable even for a couple. Piccadilly Garden area (right in front of hotel) is a bit seedy at night.
