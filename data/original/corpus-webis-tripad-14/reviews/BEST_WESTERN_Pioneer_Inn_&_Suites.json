I am very picky about the rooms and I thought they were big and roomy. Everything worked good and the pool was nice. The kids had a good time and my husband went gambling. They have a shuttle to the casino and thier is a pizza place in the hotel--pizza's okay, but nothing special and then thier is a fancy restarant which we had the breakfast buffet the next morning for $5 a person which was pretty good. The dinner menu had alot of fancy stuff that I have never eatten and then steaks which I usually don't order and it was expensive $13 and up.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "worldtraveler1000", "date": "September 5, 2005", "id": 3843737}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Little gem of a hotel.", "text": "Excellent hotel in the center of town with friendly staff, clean rooms and nice restaurant. We never received actual verification that the chef is one of the top 3 in Michigan as the front desk boasted. However, it could be true. The meal was exceptionally good and the service, excellent. The pork dish is their specialty and the home made desserts were delicious.

We booked this hotel because it was the only non-smoking room available in Escanaba for the evening. It was a king room w/ a sofa bed, microwave, and fridge. Very large and very nice room! The hotel gave us two free drink coupons for the hotel bar and breakfast was free as well. The breakfast was a hot buffet with pancakes, eggs, sausages, potatoes, biscuits/gravy, etc. Check-in was quick and easy and the staff was very nice. We had requested a crib and it was not in the room but the staff brought us a crib within a few minutes once we called them.

We were expecting a room with two queen beds, a full pull out couch, microwave and fridge. When we got there we were told the heater in our room was out and that we would be put into adjoining rooms for the night. that was fine! I understand that heaters go out in the winter! We got into our rooms (by the way, we have two adults and three children) the heater in one room didn't work, in the same room I found moldy, yes moldy, coffee in the coffee pot and when i tried to pour it out the sink was clogged. I called the front desk explaining the problem and was rudely told that they would look into it and to just sleep in the other room. (have you ever tried squeezing five people into two queen beds?). the next day we were told our orginial room was ready and to just wait half an hour for the heater to warm up the room. Great! 45 mins later we were informed that our room was no longer available and the would \"be willing to allow\" us to stay in our current room and they would \"try\" to get the heater and sink fixed.
