ANyway, We LOVED it, We had a queen bad and a folding bed for our son, In the back of the room was a lockable door that led upstairs to a wonderful kitchen area that had the most levley sitting area,,,, big windows. Our our room was very clean, our bathroom was of good size and the location is wonderful. We were in walking distance of the sea life center and the bay. Although we didn't meet the owneers, and we had to meet our boat tour the next morning, we left a note explainnig that we were leaving and we called them after we returned just to make sure all was ok, and it was.", "title": "Lovely, charming and great location, It was a good value...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PiratesOfTheCarib", "date": "August 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37995848}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Only gripe, and it is a very small one.

It was good for that. The property is a 2 bedroom + cubbyhole wooden bungalow built on a cross roads. Big problem with noise of traffic, although its not a massively busy town. The beds were clean. The entire property seems to have been decorated as 'New England by the Sea' eg everything painted white and bare boards on the floor. This sounds okay until you realise that the things they are painting white are the 3 bits of wood that they have nailed together to make a coffee table! The rest of the furniture was as bad with most of it reminding us of stuff our granny threw out. Most of the bulbs in the property were out and the bathroom was something out of the 70's. This in itself is not a problem until you find out that the toilet doesn't take things away when flushed and the towels that are provided are definately 30 years old.", "title": "Not worth the pretty expensive cost.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Something-Different!", "date": "September 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 78540002}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "There was also a lot of slaters in the property (woodlice).

We arrived late so we didn't have the opportunity to meet the innkeeper, and we left pretty early so we did not take advantage of any common room amenities. The accomodations in the Mermaid Room were sufficient for the time that we spent there - everything was nice and clean. Only downsides: had some trouble getting a hold of the innkeeper for the room door code, the view from the balcony was not as nice as I was imagining (blocked somewhat by trees) and the thermostat appeared to be missing its cover so we couldn't tell how to control the heat. Otherwise, it was an ok place to rest my head while in Seward.", "title": "The worst customer service...ever!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TEXASSWIFT", "date": "August 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 75980743}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Sea treasure inn", "text": "First, when we arrived, there was a sign on the door saying she (Owner or Manager) was \"running errands\" and would be right back. We waited (6 people/3 rooms) for a while then I called and left a message. About that time another guest was there and told us to find the room combination (no key) on our confirmation letter. Well our confirmation letter was different and no room code. Then she (the other guest who also just arrived) told us to use the first 4 numbers of the confirmation code. Our code included letters so we took the first 4 that were numeric and it worked. Thank goodness. We unloaded our car and went exploring. About 1.5 to 2 hours later, she finally called back. Later that evening we returned to room. The family member that reserved the room had to put the reservation on her credit card. We did not want her to pay for all 3 rooms so I called her (by the way her name is Rissie) and asked if she come to the B&B (she never once showed up) so we could pay separately for each room. At that point she told me she was in the middle of dinner and she would come later. I told her that we were heading out to eat. She told me the later the better after she put her kids down. (Remember, she is still offsite, \"running errands\"). I didn't call when we returned because I knew it was a hassel and didn't want to deal with her. In the middle of the night she knocks on one of our doors (waiting my in-laws, one of which was extremely sick). They didn't answer so she put a note on the door. The next day we had an early morning exploration and when leaving that morning I shut our door and it didn't lock so from the inside I turned a knob, shut the door and it locked. When we returned about 10:30 to gather our belongings we were locked out (no where did a sign say not to turn the lock to lock the door). The housekeeper happen to be there because the other guest was leaving that morning. I told her we were locked out. She tried to use her combination but were still locked out. She continued doing laundry and tried calling Rissie. I too tried calling 7 times. About 30 minutes later Rissie calls back to tell me the housekeeper has a key. The housekeeper told us she didn't have the key. I had Rissie talk to the housekeeper who did in fact have the key and unlocked the door. What would have happened if the other guest was not leaving??? No housekeeper or manager to unlock our door. The customer service was absolutely horrible. The rooms were okay. Our room's TV was about 9 inches an a pizza was left in our refrigerator. The TV in another room had sound but no picture. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS B&B TO ANYONE!!!", "user": "SM1234085", "date": "July 25, 2010", "id": 72206284}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very clean and nicely decorated rooms.
