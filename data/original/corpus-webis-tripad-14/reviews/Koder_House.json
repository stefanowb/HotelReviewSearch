The hotel is a former private home of one of Fort Cochin's leading Jewish Families (sadly now mostly gone), but at least their lovely home remains and is open for travellers. Our suite was huge, with a lovely four-poster bed, large dressing room and en suite bath with separate shower and jacuzzi bath. The restaurant was good, but the menu never changed, nor did there seem to be a special of the day (shame), so after two lunches and dinners, we pined for something different. There is a tiny pool just off the restaurant - seems to be a bit of a gimick to me, as we never saw anyone use it. I think the space would be far better having an outdoor area for dining! The tables/chairs in the dining room are huge...but tables are limited, so many walk-in guests cannot be accommodated. With so many new guest houses being opened in the area, Koder House will come under some pressure to add amenities. There is a small spa in the hotel, which offered good treatments at great prices. Staff and service were excellent. One major point - the hotel lacks a bar, and asking for pre-dinner drinks anywhere but in the restaurant proved to be a bit of an undertaking...and they are not licensed for spirits - just wine and beer. A nice touch was the delicious slice of chocolate & orange cake that was left by the bed nightly, with a sweet note wishing you a good night on your pillow. If I returned to Fort Cochin, I would not hesitate to stay at Koder House again.", "title": "Very enjoyable stay - great staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A-and-SLondon", "date": "January 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6573994, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The history, and the size of the accommodation", "disliked": "\u2014 lack of bar facilities"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We read all the raves about Koder House on Trip Advisor and so decided to come here for a treat after two weeks traveling around India with our adult kids and staying at cheaper hotels.

It is not a hip, minimalist, elegant hotel with attitude. It is an old, wooden house built by one of the leading Jewish families in Fort Cochin and purchased two years ago by Mrs and Mrs Vicky Raj who restored it and tried to keep it looking as it had in the 19th century. I personally found that very welcome. But if you want something more contemporary than the Malabar or the hotel next to Koder House (I think it is called Harbour View) would be better. The Raj's ordered wonderful high, wooden beds with really comfy mattresses and traditional looking light fixtures for the bedrooms. They also put in new bathrooms with jacuzzi and shower and a small outdoor pool where the garage had been. The effect is really a simple, old fashioned one. The rooms are huge and the suites have a vast dressing area. But please note that this is an old house so you hear will footsteps from the floor above. If you mind, then make sure you take a room on the top floor. It's a very personal, intimate hotel with attentive service.
