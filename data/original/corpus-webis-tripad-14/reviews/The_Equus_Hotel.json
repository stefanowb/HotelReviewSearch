If not stay here. Total refurbishment since my last stay very nice. Yes the trim on the elevator needs attention, but I believe the mechanicals had been totally rebuilt recently, prior visit it was clean but decidely run down . Now very clean room, quality linens new furniture and rebuilt baths, all tastefully done. This is a smaller hotel with ltd services, but location is ideal, five minutes from the beach and ten from Ala Moana Centre. The road noise is there, but in all fairness to the hotel there was a repaving project going on during the last week in Sep. The noise did subside after midnight. I suspect many other Waikiki hotels are equally noisy. If you want total quiet go stay at a resort out of town, Waikiki is in the middle of Honolulu folks. I paid 1/3 the going rate of a room at the Hilton Hawaiin village and pocketed the difference, as all I wanted was a clean bed. ABC store just up the steet (a Hawaiian 711) and Outback and Red Lobster are right across the street. Many other restaurants and bars in local area. Breakfast was continental, coffee, fruit and pastries, if you want more, stay elsewhere or pay for a full hot breakfast, it was not a big deal with me as I do not eat much breakfast as a rule. Very cooperative front desk staff unlike prior stay so that is a big improvement as well.
