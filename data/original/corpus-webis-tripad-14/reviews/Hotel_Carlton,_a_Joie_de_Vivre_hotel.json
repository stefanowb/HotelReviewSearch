We found the rooms to be very clean and larger than many we have stayed at in other hotels in San Francisco. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is a wine reception from 5:30 - 6:00 pm daily and on the Saturday we were there they even had someone playing music. The area is not the best since you are not in the heart of a touristy area. However, if you walk east on Sutter Street you arrive at Union Square in 10 minutes. Two blocks to the west is Van Ness Street where you can find a Peet's Coffee or a Starbucks. The room we had on the 8th floor was quiet and it's nice that you can open the windows which have screens on them. Large closet with safe. The walls, however, are thin and you can hear what's going on in the room next to you. The bathroom was a nice size and the shower pressure was very good. You do not get little bottles of shampoo, instead they have dispensers in the shower for soap, shampoo and conditioner. They do give you a bar of soap for the sink area. There is free WiFi.
