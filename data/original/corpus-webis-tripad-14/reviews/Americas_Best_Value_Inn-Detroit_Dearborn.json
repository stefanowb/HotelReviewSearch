The room was not cleaned, found cigarette in a non-smoking room. everything was dirty, with spiders in the bathroom. The front desk person was not nice and for 59$ plus taxes it is a rip off. Furthermore, there are a lot of hotels in this area which are better. avoid it by any mean.", "title": "The worst hotel.. ever", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Samuel-D", "date": "August 16, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3768468}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005, traveled on business", "text": "I recently booked four rooms at the Best Value Inn in Dearborn, Michigan for my team. The price for the rooms were very reasonable, considering we had four guests in each room ($59.99n + tx). The property is a bit hard to find considering that Michigan Avenue isn't marked coming from the direction I traveled (I-75 N). The hotel is an older property, thus the rooms are a bit smaller than what's expected with newer properties. The front desk clerks were very cordial and accomodating.", "title": "Alright.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "csurugbyhooker", "date": "April 26, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3415845}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Dearborn"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 2, "very good": 0, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 0.866666666667}
