Santi has all the personality in the hotel. (We did not have dinner at the hotel) There is also a lovely shaded garden in the back for a quiet swing while reading a book. Convenient to all the boats, water taxis, gondolas, alilagunas you could want, the hotel is a two minute walk to St Marks. In the late afternoon, you can have a drink at one of the cafes in the square and enjoy the war of the bands. Splurge and enjoy a water taxi tour with a bottle of wine.
