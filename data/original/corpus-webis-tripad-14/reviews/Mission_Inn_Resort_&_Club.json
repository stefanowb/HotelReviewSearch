The grounds were very lush and a true golfer's paradise. The room was clean and it was my understanding that the rooms went under rennovation only a few years back. My room was well stocked with towels and amenities. I liked the fact that each room had its own private balcony. Each night i received turn down service (without asking). The food was average, nothing to write home about. The staff was friendly and willing to help. Outside of the inn there really wasnt much to keep you busy at night. During the day there is a winery close by and a short drive to Mount Dora may provide some retail therapy. This is not a place to party but more of a place to unwind and take it easy. Being that it is family owned they take the time to make sure things are right.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 29, 2006", "id": 5411580}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best Kept Secret", "text": "I have just returned from my fourth visit to the Mission Inn Resort located in Howey-in-the-Hills, Florida, about 45 minutes north of Orlando airport.

This lovely resort has two wonderful golf courses, a terrific golf academy and an old fashioned low key ambiance. There is no spa, no Turkish towel in the bathroom but if you are looking for great golf, very good food and a no hassle vacation at very reasonable rates, this is the place you should try. I attended the golf academy last April with several friends and we just loved everything. The teaching pro was terrific and my handicap dropped by 7 after I returned home. After a morning of lessons, we played 18 holes of golf, took a dip in the pool, soaked in the hot tub and then ended the day with dinner...all without ever leaving the resort. The rooms were clean and nice but not fancy. Management was sometimes a bit disorganized but always extremely helpful, responsive and pleasant.
