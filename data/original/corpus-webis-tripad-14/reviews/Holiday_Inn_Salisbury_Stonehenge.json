Would stay there again. On arrival, one trainee trying to book a guest in, who was already booked in, but wanted to stay an extra night. Seemed to be taking ages. Another receptionist appeared, and either couldn't or didn't want to to check me in, because I had only booked within the last half an hour, and there was an issue with the the paperwork, which wasn't explained to me??? She passed me on to her trainee colleague, who was still struggling with her guest. Not beyond the realms of possibility for her to check me in??? Didn't feel welcomed by her. No conversation, probably because I wasn't wearing a suit. guest behind me was, he got the full chit-chat and check in, whilst I was still waiting. I am aware that opening doors with key cards isn' the greatest difficulty, but it seemed that I was being hurried when I asked what end goes in the lock. Probably why I ended up with 4 key cards, until an extremely nice receptionist showed me at the door how the cards work. Not the green end in first, as I thought I had been told. Arrows on the cards aren't difficult. Overall it is a very nice hotel, but personally I don't think it is as good value as the Premier Inn, certainly not at \u00a350-\u00a360 per night more. The room I had appeared smaller and the bed softer, but that is a personal opinion. Comfortable yes. Don't know if there was wireless internet, as I couldn't pick a signal up, but there was a cable, which is OK, so long as you have laptop. As I have said I would stay again, but my first choice will be Premier Inn, for value for money & welcoming staff.
