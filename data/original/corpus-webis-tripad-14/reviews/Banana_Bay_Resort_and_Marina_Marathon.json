Everyone was very helpful and nice (especially Chris at the pool bar) We spent alot of time enjoying the pool and spa. Thanks for the wonderful visit.

The rooms are clean and spacious and the beds very comfortable, the vegetation around the resort gives it a really tropical feel and the pool area is lovely. I can't praise the staff enough, especially at the restaurant and the three bars, there cannot be friendlier people in the whole of the USA than Lynn, Chrissi, Janal, Louis and John. I was travelling alone at the time and they ended up taking me out for lunch! The food at the restaurant is also excellent. I kept in touch with them and now count many of the staff as friends despite living so far away. I have now visited Banana Bay NINE TIMES and intend to carry on doing so.

Larry took us around the property and took some beautiful shots in the tropical gardens. He developed the pictures and dropped them and the negatives off at the hotel the same day. Great pictures!

I didnt really dislike or like it, it was simply an average resort in the Keys. The check-in process was very easy, but they refused to upgrade me even though there were plenty of rooms available. In fact she was kinda snippy about it, as if to say \" how dare you ask for an upgrade?\". The rooms was large, but our non-smoking room reaked of smoke. Other then that the rooms were clean but somewhat bland. The view from our balcony was almost non-existent, it looked right into some trees and then into the parking lot. The pool was OK, it had a nice little bar area with friendly bartenders and some decent poolside snacks. The breakfast buffet was a real downer and truley laughable. Dont expect any kind of meal at all. They have a man made beach which isnt really a beach, more like a rocks with a cutout sitting area. They did tell you that before you came though, I just thought it would be a litte nicer then it was. I did like the tiki bar down near the water, it was a fun place to have some drinks at the end of the day and watch a sunset. All in all the Banana Bay Resort is fine for most people, the prices are reasonable. Just dont go expecting luxury anything like that of a Hyatt or Sherton. If you keep that in mind you will probably be somewhat pleased with this resort.", "title": "A very average stay.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "icem2829", "date": "January 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4360564}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Pretty good", "text": "Our room was very nice. Read a few reviews and made our request online with specific requests then called to confirm the requests. Overall this place was good. The restaurant was supposed to be open till 10:00 PM, my wife and I showed up at 9:13pm and had to \"beg\" to be served, because the one and only waitress was whining about someone that had not came to work and she was the only one. She told us as soon as we walked in that she was closed at 9:13om, then my wife confronted her about the 10:00pm closing time and asked her what the deal was. We ended up eating there but it was a rushed situation. This place also puts a large \"hold\" on your credit card. Room was $180 and they put a $250 hold on top of that charge.
