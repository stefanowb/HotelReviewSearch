Although Santana Row makes for a lovely setting for a business or pleasure trip to the San Jose area, this hotel lacks proper upkeep. My room actually had chewed stuck gum on a wall, assorted stray hairs around, and even trash left behind the furniture. Moreover, the walls, wood trim, and furnishings are all beat up. There is no concierge service at all, no one at the front desk had the ability to suggest hikes or even help with dinner reservations. The courtyard however is lovely, the bowl of oranges a nice touch, and the free (very standard fare) breakfast a plus. Overall, I suggest that someone focus on making the rooms clean and fresh.

You aren't allowed to bring \"outside alcohol\" into your room. Are we in high school? Is management big brother? My husband and I (empty-nesting, frequent travelers) cannot have a glass of our own wine while we watch the news at night in our room? Really? Also, please note that they add 19% to the $7 bottle of water, and anything else you eat from the snack tray in your room, and if you happen to prefer to not be tempted by it during your stay, they charge $25 to remove it from your room. Do they happen to be sympathetic at all to guests with allergies to Snickers and peanut M&M's, or guests who struggle with weight issues? Bed was comfy, room was quiet, complimentary breakfast was very nice, and while they define it as \"continental,\" it included hot eggs, a meat, potatoes the days we stayed, in addition to traditional continental fare.
