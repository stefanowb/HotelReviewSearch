Everyone on staff went overboard to help. The service at breakfast is fantastic, and there is a vast selection of food offered. I was in awe when I walked down the stairs from the first floor to the breakfast room to see a view that was like no other. I could have stayed in a single spot all day. I am eager to return to Capetown and when I do, I plan to stay in this hotel.

The staff were helpful , attentive and they were determined to make the stay an enjoyable one. The rooms were spacious and clean and the room safe was an added bonus. Breakfasts were were excellent and the a la carte meals were of a high standard. Nothing was too much trouble. Most people tried the local restaurants. The restaurant had a little bit of a canteen feel - but do not let that fool you as the food is top quality. The Hotel is 15 minutes good walk to the Cape Town Waterfront. Taxis cost about 40 -50 Rand. Make sure you take a metered taxi - there unregistered taxis claiming to be the hotel shuttle.

Our bedroom overlooking the football stadium was large, spotless and had a flatscreen tv with all the sports channels - there were a couple of teething problems, leaking shower and safe which hadn't been wired up. Breakfast was excellent with a huge choice and a large vegetarian section. The hotel is within easy reach of the V&A waterfront and the city centre. We were advised to book a taxi to travel after dark which we did - to be fair we were pestered by beggars during the day when out walking - but, this is my only gripe with the hotel, the 'taxi' would arrive immediately - impressive until you realised it was one of the hotel staff's limos and you were then charged 40 rands for the first passenger and 20 each for the rest of the group, making a short journey for four 100 rand(dearer than London?)", "title": "Contemporary Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shopaholic1980_03", "date": "September 25, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118569953}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel had just been open 1 day after extensive renovation and in my opinion still had to find its heart and soul.
