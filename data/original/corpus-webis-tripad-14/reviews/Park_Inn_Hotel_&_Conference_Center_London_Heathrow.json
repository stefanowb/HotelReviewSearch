The rooms are perfectly decent. They're similar to those found in the better/newer Travelodges. The one problem I had was that I was freezing. There was no radiator, just a kind of vent that pumped out hot air. It was off when I went in; there were no instructions on how to operate it, but it was easy enough to work out. It took about three hours for the room to become warm, by which time it was almost time for me to get up unfortunately. I made the mistake of turning it off when I went down to breakfast, so when I discovered we were going to be delayed further, I had to start the process all over again. The breakfast is very good. It's self-service and there's loads to choose from, both hot and cold. Staff also go round sorting tea and coffee out for you. I made sure to load up my plate. It was difficult to get the right information from staff at times, but it's difficult to know whether it was them or the airline that was to blame - probably the latter I would say based on my experience.
