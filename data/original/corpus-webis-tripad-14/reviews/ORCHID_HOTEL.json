The family room was lovely - spacious, with a small balcony, computer in the room, good toiletries plus nice touches such as the animal towels, satin covers on the complimentary water bottles and complimentary fruit. The standard room had much the same facilities, however obviously smaller, but the main negative was the solid brick wall about 20 cm from the window! It wasn't a big deal as we didn't spend much time in the room, but we realised after the first night that the space between the wall and the window actually goes down to the breakfast room - so if you have your window open, a lot of noise travels upwards very early in the morning. The other negative was that although we booked some time ago in a single booking, we were given rooms on floors 2 and 5.

As many people come to Hue on the overnight train from Hanoi, the hotel will pick you up at the train station. We were upgraded to the Honeymoon suite, on the top floor, with views of the city. The bed was very comfortable, and everything throughout the hotel is very clean. Hotel staff will solve every request and problem. They arranged bicycles so we could ride to the pagoda. When we returned, we were hot and tired, but still hoped to visit at least a few of the royal tombs. The receptionist gave us time to shower, and arranged a driver to come and pick us up and take us to three of the tombs, even though it was later in the day. Thank you! We walked to the Citadel, but you could easily take a taxi. Location was very good, as we found very good places to have an afternoon drink and excellent restuarants nearby. We opted to go to Hoi An with a driver and car from the hotel, and it was a very good experience. Our driver, Trai, spoke English well and showed us many things along the way that we would have never seen otherwise. This trip was also good value, as was everything about Hotel Orchid.
