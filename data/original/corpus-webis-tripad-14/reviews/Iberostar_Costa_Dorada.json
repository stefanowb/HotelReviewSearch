We knew it was both a monkey sanctuary as well as a certified zip line course but that we could just opt for the monkeys only. MJ itself is absolutely beautiful and the time we had feeding and visiting with the monkeys was amazing and magical and one of the highlights of our trip. That being said, the rep that sold us the excursion did not tell us that for our $180 US we would go on a bus for an hour, spend an hour waiting, visit the monkeys for 20 magical minutes and then wait for another hour for the zip line folks to finish and then wait a bit more, take the bus home. We were gone for almost 6 hours and it just was an insane amount of money to spend for that short interaction and a bottle of water. The rep said he would help us out when we talked the next day but a couple of days later he was a brick wall and then became pretty rude. In the end, we complained to guest services and I wrote a letter to MJ telling them of what happened and we were given a 25% refund which I appreciated.
