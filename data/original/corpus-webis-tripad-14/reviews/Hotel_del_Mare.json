We went for a middle of the road priced hotel and weren't disappointed with the Del Mare. Everywhere in Sorrento seems to involve hills and steps so we were expecting a lot of walking. You either end up in a hotel where you are on the right level for the town and have to walk down steps to the sea or in a position like we were at the Marina Grande where you have to walk up hill to get to town. There was a bus which picked up 100 yards fro mthe hotel which only cost 1\u20ac. My advice for Sorrento is to expect lots of walking. The breakfast at the hotel was good with quite a selection - mainly continental but a little cooked food too). We requested a sea view room which we got for the last 3 nights of our stay. From what we could tell there were only 2 rooms where you would see the sea (rooms 401 and 402). These are both based at the top of the hotel and the door of your room leads right out onto the roof terracse which is handy for sun bathing and cosy to watch the stars and the sea at night! We were in 401, the only problem with this is that it is right next to the lift so you do hear wirring when it's being used. Didn't bother us too much though and we are light sleppers. We had read previous reviews about paying the bill at the end of the stay and them not taking cards. Well they do now as we paid by Mastercard (think they took VISA too).", "title": "Good value hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "TBTA", "date": "July 26, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 5512023, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 View from our particular room", "disliked": "\u2014 The hills"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Overall we were disappointed with this hotel.", "title": "Smallest rooms I have ever experienced", "user": "greensimba", "date": "July 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5494032}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "Cons: The room basically was all bed we had no where to put our luggage without tripping on it.

On the plus side, we very much enjoyed the location. .Though it's 10-15 minute walk down from the \"main\" part of Sorrento, we enjoyed the walk, and it was very nice being in the little fishing community of Marina Grande, away from the hordes of tourists and the hustle-bustle of shops, etc. There were several good restaurants down there, where we ate 3 out of our 5 nights. Also on the plus side were the roof terrace, with great views, and the huge breakfast spread. Because the hotel seems to cater to the British, there was the typical hot breakfast (eggs, meat, etc.), plus cold meats and cheeses, every day, along with the more usual cereal, yoghurt, breads, pastries, etc. This was the only place we stayed in Italy (out of 4) that had fresh fruit--and lots of it. The public areas were very nice, and there was a bar. On the negative side, this was the smallest room we stayed in Italy, though having traveled in Great Britain and Europe before, the room size was not unexpected. There were no hangers in the ardrobe, and when we asked for more, they brought them right away--but only 4 hangers for 2 of us for a 5 day stay. The housekeeping was also a bit odd, or maybe we didn't know the appropriate conventions; for several days, we did not receive fresh towels or a bath mat, and the same wet towels greeted us at the end of the day. We've been in places where there was a sign indicating that if you want to help conserve resources and use the same towels, to hang up the towels, or if you want them changed, to leave them on the floor. that must have been the case here, but they didn't give any notice of it. Also on the negative side, we had booked the room through Italyby, and the confirmatory e-mail clearly stated we could pay via cash or credit card. This was our last stop in Italy, and we'd planned on paying by credit card. However, I was in the lobby using the internet (5 E for one hour--rather steep), and heard someone else checking out who knew he was supposed to pay in cash. I checked with the clerk, and he said we had to pay in cash too. Since we still had time to get to a Bancomat, we were able to get the cash (500 Euro for 5 nights), but I wonder what would have happened had it been too late to get the cash? I didn't bother to go get the e-mail to show the clerk, as it was easier to just get the money rather than argue over it.", "title": "Just needs better directions!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "amiller16", "date": "May 30, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5235856}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great hotel in Sorrento", "text": "This is a great little hotel in Sorrento.

My friend and I arrived via hydrofoil from Naples, picked up the bus (located by the hydrofoil station) to Piazza Aniello, took a 2 min walk to Piazza Tasso to then took the Linea D to Marina Grande then walked 5 minutes to the hotel. Note that Linea D does not come around very often about every 20-30 minutes so you could be waiting a while. If you arrive by train it's quite a walk as well so you'll want to take Linea D or a taxi. Don't waste the extra euro on a balcony at all, it's so small you can barely sit, I'd suggest just getting a basic room. The shower is extremely small (and we're both smaller girls) so that may also be a challenge for some. The front desk people were very nice and they have internet access available for a fee. Marina Grande has some beautiful restaurants. The 10 minute walk into the center of town requires walking up a lot of steps and a hill so those with disabilities may have a challenge getting into town. The Linea D bus does also run from the Marina to town so that's another option (again, it doesn't come very often).
