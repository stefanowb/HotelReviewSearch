I like both of them, but i do like the city a little better. The location is right in the old town and is off the main streets. The staff are so helpful, and the rooms are a nice size. The breakfast was very good, they will do some cooked to order items if you ask. My room was a deluxe room, but to me it was more like a Jr. Suite, a nice sitting area, table and fresh fruit. The bed was nice, the bathroom was a nice size. It is a smaller hotel and I like that..
