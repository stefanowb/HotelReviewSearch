We had room 30, which is a double with a sea view balcony. The view is worth everything they charge, which was considerable, but a lot less than if we had made reservations for July or August. The hotel is small, a showplace of colorful Italian tile.....on the floors, in the bathrooms, in the common rooms, in the restaurant. It is steps from the Beach, and our room had a desk, mini bar, hair dryer, big shower/tub, table and chairs on the balcony (about 12 feet long and 5-6 feet wide) louvered doors so that you could have privacy and still hear the surf, comfortable bed and pillows. But the best part is the view....it overlooks the beach, and the hillside to the right, with the buildings marching down to the pier where the ferries dock. It is centrally located, the staff is very accommodating, the breakfasts are in a common room with access to a patio that overlooks the beach, the selection of breakfast foods is also excellent. And, for a special treat, we scheduled the cooking school....what a fun time. If you have the time, don't miss this treat....you make your dinner and enjoy it with your fellow students and take home a hat, apron and cookbook...to say nothing of the great memories.

The staff is all very friendly and goes out of their way to assist with any request. The hotel and rooms are very clean and beautifully decorated. We recommend trying to get a room on the first or second floor of the annex building; rooms 42 to 48 have nice terraces with perfect views of the sea. We had the chance to participate in the cooking class offered by the Buca di Bacco restaurant which was an amazing experience. We not only learned some great cooking tips but we were able to sit down and enjoy one of the best meals of our trip prepared by ourselves that included wine. My only comment about this hotel to be aware of is that they currently do not accept American Express as a method of payment. The hotel needs to do a better job informing customers prior to their arrival that American Express is not accepted. It could be a real issue for an individual that may only carry an American Express card when they go to check out of the hotel.", "title": "Best Views in Positano, but they don't take AMEX!?!?", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Carol F", "date": "July 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 167864331}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "On a family holiday - we had such great meals, fantastic service, tourist advice and comfort.
