We specifically reserved the king suite with jacuzzi as it was on the top floor at the rear of the hotel and would be quiet ( we usually go to bed by midnight and SoBe can be noisy until well past 4 am). We drove down from Orlando and arrived at 3:30 pm. The kid working at the front desk could not find our reservation and told us that the king suite was already reserved by another party. We had him call the manager, who called their reservation dept. and they found our reservation. Since we had already pre-paid the room for two nights and the other party hadn't yet arrived, they gave us the room. We got the keys but when we opened the door, it became apparent that the previous tenants were still there and had left all their things in the room. So now the room was triple booked. The manager said that there was nothing he could do; the hotel was fully booked and he couldn't evict the previous tenants. They put us up at one of the group's other hotels in a smaller room directly over the lobby/bar, fronting the street directly across from a nightclub. Not a quiet room. The first night wasn't so bad, but the next night they booked a private party until after 1 am. The music was so loud that when I called down to complain, they said they couldn't hear me over the music and I needed to yell. The whole experience was one screw up after another by these people. I would avoid the entire chain in the future.", "title": "Fun & hip beach hotel", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "princessadelle", "date": "January 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4348387}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Hated it!", "text": "I've stayed here 4 or more times over the past 5 years.

If you cross the street to the left of the hotel and walk up towards the beach its right there on the corner, i think thats 8th & collins.. Its a about a 3min walk.

This hotel has a great bar, that has happy hour, but beware its only with cheap house vodka. A good goose martini can be about $12-14, which is expected in SOBE anyway. The rooms are small yes but come with an awesome CD player, the beds were made and cleaned nicely, the bathroom doesn't have a shower curtain its one of those new step in showers thats has granite tiles and is glassed in. No counter space in the bathroom but one shelf for cosmetics. The maid took awhile to come to clean the room. But whose in the room all day anyway when your on vacation.Other than that things were fine, hallways are a bit dark, they have the whole dim light thing going on in the halls so watch your step. Front Desk staff, is usually pleasant & helpful during checkin and giving passes for nightclubs. So all and all, if your looking to come down to SOBE with your friends to hang out and party or chill this hotel is great. If you are expecting to have lots of amenities and want a romantic weekend away stay at the Eden Roc or Courtyard Oceanfront both of which i have stayed in and have had a wonderful time.

Only 1 hotel employee seemed remotely concerned and finally moved us to the 2nd room. The light in the bathroom was about as bright as a candle- forget putting on makeup. I have stayed at nicer places in Mexico or Spain. I had much higher expectations for this hotel in the \"ritzy\" South beach area. The website for the hotel is deceiving. The continental breakfast was pathetic - bread and OJ - or coffee and cereal. Forget that is is advertised as being \"free\". You are charged an extra $5 a day resort charge that helps for the breakfast. Our TV didn't even work. I felt like we were \"roughing it\". Not a very relaxing vacation hotel.
