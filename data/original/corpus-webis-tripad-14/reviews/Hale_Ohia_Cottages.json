If you have cold feet like me-be sure to bring slippers. The food in Volcano is extremely limited (especially if your husband refuses to eat Thai) and like everything else in Hawaii, expensive. The bread and fruit the management provides is nice, but you'll probably have to go to a grocery to survive.
