I've stayed at the Hyatt and Westin, however, the Hilton is my favorite and have stayed there the last 8 trips. The location can't be beat: near Namdemun market, Seoul Station, 3 subway lines, Namsan Mt, and the Meoyndong district. The service is excellent from checkin to room service to the executive lounges-there are two, with excellent views of downtown, Namsan Mountain, and Seoul Tower.
