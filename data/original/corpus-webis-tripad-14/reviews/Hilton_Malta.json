We found the hotel ok, but nothing that special. We were on a Bed & Breakfast board & the breakfast (which was self service) was actually very good and of a high standard. We ate one night in the hotel, which was a buffet and the food was awful. Very little selection, the potatoes were hard and tasted like they had sat there for hours, vegetables weren't nice but the lamb we had was ok, again nothing special. We asked for a glass of tap water & was refused because they don't recommend their guests to drink it.....the reason for this.....probably because they charge 5 (Euros) for a medium sized bottle of water. We found the hotel very expensive. A cocktail, Pina Colada for example, which wasn't that big and full with ice cost 8.95 (Euros). A total rip off in my opinion. They also cater alot of private functions, especially weddings. We saw 2 wedding ceremony's take place by the pool and the receptions in the evening, which were held outside where the balconies face. The music was so loud we complained to management & asked when the music would stop & they informed us 12.30am. Not impressed as we had to be up at 7am the next morning. The music was a band & singer, but the singer was awful....couldn't even hold a correct note! Even with the balcony doors shut & our tv on, we could still hear the band very clearly. You wouldn't expect that from a 5* hotel. All in all, the hotel was ok, I probably wouldn't go back there, although alot of people in Malta say it's the best hotel on the island.

Went from 2 September to yesterday. First impressions are very good and when you walk around St Julians you realise that the location of the hotel is perfect for other restaurants and shops etc. We paid more for an Executive room (see other benefits later) which was nicely fitted with lots of wood. The bathroom I must say was huge, with an enormous bath and a separate walk-in shower. What I liked about it was that the shutters in the bedroom could be slid along so that from the bathroom you could literally see through the bedroom, through the balcony, out onto the sea! A great view when showering, believe me! The room was always kept spotless. Unless you put the appropriate sign on your door at night you will be woken up by room service to clean the room around 8.30 so if you want a lie-in, put the note on the door ;-). This was my first stay at a Hilton hotel-usually I find these chains too corporate and we prefer to stay in upmarket boutique-style hotels. But we couldn't fault this hotel. We had breakfast in the Exec Lounge a few mornings which was fine but, as 1 of the other reviewers has mentioned, the choice is MUCH bigger downstairs in the Oceana restaurant. Every morning we managed to get a table outside by the pool (we had to wait all of 5 mins one morning, LOL) which was quite something. It just sets you up for the day, having that view in brilliant sunshine first thing. The omelettes are lovely, thanks to Stuart on the counter-very friendly again. The pools are also first class-there are 4 and we tried 3 of them during the stay. You can have afternoon tea with sandwiches and cakes in the afternoon-all complimentary in the Exec Lounge as well as drinks and snacks (calamari, mini-burgers-all delicious) in the evening and sit on the balconies overlooking the pools. Special mention goes to LISA on the Exec Lounge Reception. She is genuinely lovely with a unique disposition-exactly what is needed to provide outstanding customer service. Nothing was too much trouble. She even showed us a different room (only because, yes we had a sea view room but the view was not as good as some of the older rooms) but when we saw the older room we decided to stay where we were because the new rooms are MUCH nicer and bigger. She came to say Goodbye when she left on Thursday evening because she knew she wouldn't be there on our last day. She really is lovey as well as being very efficient at what she does. Another thank you goes to Fabio who always chatted to us in the Exec Lounge as well as in the pool cafe- genuinly friendly guy-Good Luck for his wedding next year!. Cheryl was also lovely with a big smile (pool cafe).

As children under 16 are not welcome in the gym, the adult pool, the Jacuzzi, or even to ride the elevators unaccompanied, it became apparent that my pre-teens were not going to be able to enjoy many of the fantastic facilities. To add insult to injury - the weather was far more beautiful in early May than most summer days in England, Ireland or France - setting the tone for our experience at Hilton Malta.
