We were scheduled to vacation there a year ago but had to cancel that trip. We left our deposit on the books with Xanadu and excitedly re-scheduled for this year. Due to my miscommunication with them about our reservation, we ended up staying in three different units while there, but that was fine with us as we got to compare and contrast and have a better idea of which unit we will request when (not if) we return. As many others have already said, the staff at Xanadu is superb.....they are genuinely concerned about the comfort and happiness of their guests. Tiffany, Jamil and Orlando always greeted us with big smiles and warm conversation. The Belizeans in general are happy, friendly people and when you say no, the vendors don't harass you to buy their wares......the usual response was \"Well, maybe next time!

The grounds and rooms are beautiful and the people there could not be friendlier or more helpful. The location is great because you are just a walk away from San Pedro but far enough away that it is quiet and peaceful. We stayed in the studio suite and it was very spacious and had a well equipped kitchen. The kitchen was perfect because we are divers and could make our coffee and breakfast so we could be out on the dock for early boat rides. The other plus for divers is the free use of outdoor lockers to hang your dive stuff. The locker area has a good rinse area for your gear and secure storage-very helpful.

This is no problem and frankly is a good thing because the resort is not large and a restaurant would just add noise. There are fine restaurants and bars within a five minute walk down the beach in either direction. When you want to go further away, cabs cost just five bucks U.S. and the desk can call one for you or you just walk out the front of the resort and wave one down. It never took more than two minutes to get a cab. If you do need a beer or soda while hanging around the pool or beach you can get one at the front desk for about the same price as the grocery, so no need for a bar.
