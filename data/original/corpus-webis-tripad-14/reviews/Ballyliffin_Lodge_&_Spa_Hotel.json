Hotel is probably best in Ballyliffin (I've been to the others and they are probably 2.5/3 star - they're not bad just I think this is better) and added bonus of pool and steam room etc. Rooms good. We ate in the bar as part of a 2BB1D package and the food was v good. Old style bar which gets busy with wedding parties at the weekend. Went out in Buncrana one night and the spot there is O'Flaherty's. All in all, I would stay here again for the great value package and proximity to golf course.
