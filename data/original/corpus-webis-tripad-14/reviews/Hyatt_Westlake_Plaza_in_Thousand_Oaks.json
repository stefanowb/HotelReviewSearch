The public areas are attractive with fountains and seating areas. However, the rooms are bare bones, run-of- the-mill accomodations which featured standard bedding and small bathrooms. There is definitely audible traffic noise from the rooms near the highway. Closing the drapes at night muffled the sounds considerably. I opted for a weekend rate of $99 which included breakfast. I only visited the restaurant for breakfast which was served buffet style and was tasty. I am pleased that I opted for the free breakfast hotel rate as the breakfast for two would have been $27. The view into the gardens from the restaurant was appealing. The service at the hotel was not engaging with the customers. I was not greeted by the valet or any other staff I encountered in the hallways. This hotel seems to cater to the convention crowd (there was one going on this weekend) and forgoes personal service. The lodging options are limited in this area so competition does not keep management \"on their toes\".", "title": "Hyatt in name only", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Cottonwood", "date": "February 21, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 3213522}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2005, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed here in February... it was a nice, quiet hotel with great access to the freeway.
