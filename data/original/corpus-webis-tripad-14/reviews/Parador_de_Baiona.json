The parador is like a large manor house within ancient castle walls, sited superbly on a promontory looking out to sea. Don't miss walking both around the ramparts (I do like a hotel with its own cannon) which has stunning views of the bay where Columbus's ships sailed in to tell Europe that they had discovered an unknown land across the sea - the Americas! Then walk the lower coastal path beneath the hotel to enjoy a paddle or a sunbathe on the rocky little beaches, or contemplate the crashing Atlantic waves. The parador itself is pleasant, roomy and quite atmospheric. It has a swimming pool with a gated garden, but didnt really enjoy sunbathing there as rather a lot of insects and prefer the pretty little bits of sand, and more local life going on below on the rocks! It is an easy 10 minute walk down to the town and its restaurants and shops.

For the price, and for the reputation of the paradors, I think I did expect more. I was also a bit put off when we were walking back up the drive to the parador from the town and the security guard stopped us and didn't seem to believe that we were staying at the parador. Obviously we do not look posh or old enough (as the clientele I would estimate are mostly over 50). I found him quite rude and it was not until I got the room keys out of my bag to show him that he finally let us past. Baiona however is a great town and I will definitely be returning but I doubt it will be to this hotel.
