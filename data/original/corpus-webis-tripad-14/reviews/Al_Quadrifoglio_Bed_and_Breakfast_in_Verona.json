He is extremely friendly, has tons of recommendations for restaurants and things to do in Verona, he gives you a great room and breakfast and is genuinely caring. He personally came and picked up in his car us and another couple at the Arena after the opera because it was late. The room was huge by European standards and very nice. The bathroom was shared w/ the 2 other bedroom but was rarely in use and very clean. The breakfast was copious and delicious - great coffee especially! Extremely good value for the money! You have free use of computer/ internet and a living room w/ reading material.

I would like to add that travellers who are very conscious of safety and security will find Quadrifoglio top notch. From the gate to the main entry door to the apartment door to our room door, locks and keys are very secure. Door and window fittings are of the highest quality, as indeed are the fittings in the whole apartment. The whole apartment is kept squeaky clean and we always came home to a fresh, immaculate, comfortable setting that is even better than the website photos show. We felt very spoiled and lucky to have found Giusy and Davide's B&B and will definitely recommend their place to nice people.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 8, 2006", "id": 5440172}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled on business", "text": "We were 4 friends attending the 12th World Bridge Championships in Verona. We were at the Al Quadrifoglio for 2 weeks and we will always be grateful to the one friend who found this wonderful place for us. It is simply decorated but in an elegant manner, scrupulously clean and airy, and in the hosts Davide and Giusy you find not only friends but family. They were always ready to hear about the travails and triumphs of our day at the competition; to give us advice on where to go in and around Verona, where to dine cheaply and better; how to make Giusy's delicious homemade marmalade. They brought guests to and from the airport and the railroad station, almost at any time of the day or night, and were always welcoming and ready to help. I knew almost nothing of Verona when I arrived, but during my stay at the Al Quadrifoglio, I felt it was my home.", "title": "Verona became home", "user": "smoky quartz", "date": "June 29, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5408749}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "We stayed one night at the lovely Al Quadrifoglio Bed and Breakfast in Verona in April 2006. The owners are so very warm and welcoming and go out of their way to accommodate their guests. The B&B is actually an apartment about a 10 minute walk outside of Verona's historical centre. It is clean, bright, modern, and beautifully decorated, consisting of 3 charming bedrooms and 2 large, spotless bathrooms. Plush towels and slippers are provided in the bedrooms. The owners also provide their guests with little luxuries throughout the B&B, with everything from candies in the hallway, to books in the bedrooms, to hairdryers in the bathrooms. Breakfast was simple, with breads, homemade jams, cereal, juice, and a choice of warm beverages, including the most decadent hot chocolate. The location was good, and was easily accessible by bus or taxi from the Verona train station. Checkout was early, at 10:45am, but you can store your luggage at the B&B if need be. The Al Quadrifoglio is highly recommended for a pleasant, comfortable stay in Verona.", "title": "Beautiful B&B", "user": "immaculate_itinerant", "date": "April 19, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4988879}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "For a B&B, this is a real good choice.
