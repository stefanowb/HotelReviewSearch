We have strangely not spent much time in Connemara until recently even though we live only a couple of hours drive away. Since Christmas drawn by hiking initially at Diamond Hill, we have now visited on three separate weekends, staying on each occasion in a different hotel. By far, the best experience we have had has been at the Lough Inagh Lodge. Booking was a muddled affair on my part, as it was late evening after a late difficult day. But after unfumbling my words I conveyed that we wanted to stay two nights arriving Good Friday. Without any difficulty and with warmth and good humour the booking was taken, and the possibility of a room with a view towards the lake given. We arrived in due course, and the best of surprises awaited. We were given the Joyce suite which had a lake view through all of its many windows, and from its four poster bed. Lough Inagh Lodge is in a wonderful location, completely renovated with two cosy reception rooms that provide peaceful locations in which to chat, enjoy a hot drink, drink a glass of wine or read a book, all while listening to the crackle of the fire (Easter was cold this year). There is a peaceful bar, fantastic barman, for whom nothing seems ever to be a problem and whose good humour is contagious. We ate in the restaurant our first night, our second night, and we enjoyed our stay so much we stayed for a third night and ate in the restaurant again. The standard of food is very high and we noted other dinner guests had travelled from other hotels to sample it. Lough Inagh is perfectly placed for hikers. It attracts a nice clientel drawn by the outdoors, but who like to be able to come back to wonderful comfort at the end of a hard days trek. The owner Maire is a wonderful host, warm, friendly and helped make our stay such a pleasant one. So while we have taken a break for the summer months, we will return to Connemara come Autumn.
