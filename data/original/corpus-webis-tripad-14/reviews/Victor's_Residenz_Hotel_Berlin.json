For value for money this hotel is fantastic. The rooms were large, very clean and to a good standard worthy of the 4 star rating. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We used this hotel as a base to do some Berlin sightseeing and it was approx a 15 min walk to the main attractions and the train station, which we found easy although there was a regular tram that passed the end of the road if you are not so mobile. We ate in the hotel a few times and the food and service was to a high standard and not at all expensive (in comparison to UK prices). We would definitely stay at this hotel again.", "user": "happymeghappy", "date": "November 6, 2006", "id": 6063045}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "fantastic hotel for families", "text": "Ideal choice of accomodation if you are travelling with children.Booked via Expedia for 2 night city break,this four star hotel is located south east of the immediate centre in Friedrichshain.Admittedly, it is a little way from the nearest U-Bahn station (Alexanderplatz), but the walk is only 10 minutes and you can follow the giant Fernsehturm (T.V.tower) as a marker. Breakfast buffet was second to none, with an extensive selection of both continental & more traditional fare. We were there during the heatwave (39 degrees) so made use of the central courtyard for breakfast outdoors (under shade of parasols!).Hotel was a quiet,modern, well run haven with friendly staff. We booked a studio, which comes with its own ceramic hob & fridge and two self contained rooms. Kids had their own rollaway beds in T.V./lounge area & were amazed at speaker in bathroom which relayed all audio from TV (all in German of course). Friendly ice cream parlour /cafe (outside seating) next to hotel offers many varieties of excellent ices for 60 cents per cone.Best of all though, directly opposite hotel is one of Berlins's first public parks, Volkspark, which contains enough delights to keep everyone happy after a hard day's sightseeing. Zipwires,sprinkler fountains,play areas,outdoor cinema screen,bar/cafe area...list is endless.You will even spot a red squirrel or two.Marchenbrunnen,a Neo-baroque style fountain with Brothers Grimm fairy tale decoration is another attraction . We wouldn't hesitate to return.", "user": "Berlinfans", "date": "July 29, 2006", "id": 5525802}], "location": {}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 13, "very good": 66, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 58}, "aka": "Victors Residenz Berlin", "slim_ranking": 0.125937031484, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.0}}
