It was a fairly nice hotel, across the street from a stunning beach. But compared to other Embassy Suites we've visited, this property was slightly below average overall, especially with regards to staff friendliness and the complimentary breakfast buffet. We found some staff members to be indifferent to the point of coming across as borderline rude. (Staff members with the kind of curt attitudes you might expect in NYC, but not in Destin.) Service was slow at times on the breakfast buffet. The variety of food was mildly disappointing.
