The W hotel is relatively new and many taxi drivers could not find it. Carry one of the hotel's address card, since many taxi drivers do not speak english. The hotel is new and nice but the overall dark lighting and ambiance is geared more for the younger crowd, ie less than 35. The hotel has a full size grocery, called Migros, just around the corner; very convenient. W also provides free internet in the 2nd floor lounge. Going to the hotel from the airport, there are many people just outside of customs that want to take you there but their quotes were almost twice that of the taxis that were waiting outside. So, just go straight out. We paid about $25US for a 30 minute ride. The hotel folks are very helpful. From the hotel, you can walk (10 minutes) to the first tram stop, which is Kabatas. For 1.40 TL, you can go one way to all the tourist areas, ie Sultanhamet square, Spice Bazaar, etc... Adjacent to the Blue Mosque is the Arasta Bazaar. Inside the Arasta Bazaar, is the travel agency Senkron. We paid 30 euros per adult and 15 euros per child to do a private boat trip on the Bosphorous. It included a ride to some famous cafe at the peak of a mountain which overlooked the Goldenhorn river.

The rooms are very nicely fit, but they are not sound proof - noices from next room are very loud especially in connecting rooms ! Very nice bar, but prices seem overcharged.
