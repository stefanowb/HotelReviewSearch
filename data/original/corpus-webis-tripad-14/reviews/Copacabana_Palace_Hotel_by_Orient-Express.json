I booked with Amex Platinum which included breakfast, a possible upgrade and amenity. The rate was not much above the hotel internet rate. (about $415.00 per night including tax) Sure enough I was upgraded to a suite (I asked if it was possible) in the building overlooking the pool and ocean and given the amenity of two free massages! That is the best amenity I have ever seen in the program and the they were excellent! There was also no charge for the internet.(Intercontinental hotels are off my list for this reason) The front desk, Linea especially, was expert and professional. Note the closest ATM for Americans is in the train station about two blocks away. Local bank ATMS will not work. There is an excellent hair salon Camarim, around the corner that is reasonably priced. The Cipriani Restaurant, in the hotel, was excellent and obviously has a different chef from the hotel kitchen that provides room service. The room service food (dinner one night) was very average. I made an interesting day trip to Petropolis. The concierge was quite helpful. Speaking directly to car drivers will save you money especially on your return trip to the airport.

The hotel is an old charming hotel, but we had ocean view suites in the main building and found the suite very dark and certainly not up to the standard of most 5 star hotels. The new tower block seemed to be a lot more modern and airy and the suites all have balconies. Food in the hotel is excellent and the breakfast buffet certainly can't be faulted. The waiting staff at night at the garden bar were very friendly especially Andre who knew exactly what we wanted to drink every night. The hotel gneral manager Andrea and her team were always very friendly and nothing was a problem to them. The only thing i think this hotel lacks is a little bit of 21st century 5 star, i understand it is a heritage hotel with charm and character but so is the Carlton in Cannes and it far surpasses the luxury feel of the Cop. Rio on a whole i would not recommend it is a very dirty city and the crime rate makes you feel very unsafe.
