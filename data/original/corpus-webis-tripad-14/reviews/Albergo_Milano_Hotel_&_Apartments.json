Though the weather in Varenna was unusually warm the ceiling fans and automated awnings did an excellent job of keeping our room comfortable even during the extreme heat of afternoon. The bonus of being on Lake Como in summer was the opportunity to swim in the lake, rent a boat to explore the lake in a different manner than can be done by ferry alone. This visit we bought ferry passes that allowed for travel on the entire distance from Como to Lecco and would heartily encourage anyone staying for more than a day or two to do so. We were there for a week and found something wonderful to do each day. This was in part thanks to the wonderful advice of Bettina and Egi, the owners, who take the time to learn the individual interests of their guests and make suggestions of restaurants and activities that one might not know about on their own or from the standard guidebooks. No visit to Albergo Milano is complete without experiencing a sunset dinner on the restaurant patio overlooking the lake. The scenery is enhanced by the food Egi and his staff create as well as the advice Egi gives about wines to compliment the food. Even if you aren't lucky enough to get a room at Albergo Milano booking a sunset dinner there is a must for enjoying Lake Como and Varenna.", "title": "Home away from home", "user": "coolmeow", "date": "August 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36713709}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I spent three nights here in June.

The furnishings were very basic but the room was spacious, the bed comfortable with nice linens and the bathroom was beautiful with good quality toiletries. A mini fridge and complimentary internet would have been welcome. The internet was costly (\u20ac4 for 15 minutes) so we used the tabaccheria in town where you got half an hour for \u20ac3,50. As there is no air conditioning we were very fortunate to have breezy, cool nights but there is no way we could stay here in the heat of summer. No fault of Albergo Milano, the view from the bedroom and bathroom windows was disgusting, overlooking what appeared to be a deserted property used to store junk. We closed the shutters which reduced the light in the room but was worth it for the end result and really didn\u2019t cause us any hardship. Breakfast was quite nice, especially the homemade granola, and the view from the bright, cheery room was wonderful. If you are allergic to cats be aware that the resident cat visits the breakfast room daily. Albergo Milano was perfectly located and, although it was a very steep walk up from the lake, this could be circumvented by walking along XX Settembre to the main square and coming back up one of the staircases at that end of town as they were not as steep. Varenna was very old world with long mid-day closing of the shops and dinners not served before 7 pm. We chose Varenna for our visit to Lake Como because of the train station and this turned out to be the perfect location for us. It was also handy to the ferry for our visits to Tremezzo, Bellagio and Lenno. Maybe it was because of the outstanding customer service we had received at the hotels we visited prior to Varenna but we found Management less than helpful and any request was responded to with an air of inconvenience.

Yes, the views were beautiful but it was quite a challenge. We visited Villa Carlotta on Tremezzo. The day ferry pass was \u20ac11 but for \u20ac15,70 admission to Villa Carlotta was included.
