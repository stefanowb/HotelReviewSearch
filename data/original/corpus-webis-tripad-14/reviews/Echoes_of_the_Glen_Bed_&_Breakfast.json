We were doing a wine tour with four other couples. We were spread out amongst a few Watkins Glen B&Bs as each are small and we booked only a month in advanced. After getting shut out of a few others we tried, the two of us and one other couple booked at Echoes. From the website we were less than enthused but figured we would be spending minimal time in the room. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the Inn and can now conclude that the website does it no justice. The Inn was extremely clean (my fiance is allergic to cats but had no problems whatsoever) and although the rooms were small, they were quaint and had no complaints. We were on the first floor (by the kitchen) and were concerned with noise, but there was no problems from the kitchen or the street. The bathrooms were always spotless as well. The breakfasts were tasty and the location great (walking distance to the downtown area, the harbor and the state park). Barbara and Tom were great as well.

If you have never stayed in a Bed and Breakfast before, this is the one to be in for your first time. The owners, Barb and Tom, are fans of the Watkins Glen International Speedway which cannot be refused by many during the Vintage Grand Prix with all its glory and culture. While your significant other might want to enjoy the race the other can shop in town or visit the local 20+ some winery\u2019s around Seneca Lake. If you are not sure of the area Barb and Tom will certainly help you fill your day with enjoyable fun. No one can refuse the wonderful and elegant home cooking from Barb and there\u2019s always enough to go around. The breakfast muffins are homemade the evening or even the morning prior to your feast. Barb will even make breads that you never would have dreamed of making but they are a royal treat with her homemade jams. The plum jam is my all time favorite with her lemon zucchini bread. You will enjoy the local organic food from her garden and other locals. As long as you let the chef know when you want to eat the evening before you will have a hot, hearty meal waiting for you after you enjoy a hot coffee with the fresh grown flowers from around the home at the table.
