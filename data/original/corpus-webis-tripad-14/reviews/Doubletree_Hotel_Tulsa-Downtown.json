The hotel was easy to find and self-parking was $7. The lobby was beautiful and the employees were polite, but not overly friendly. Our room was as expected, but the hotel seemed older. We were able to hear our neighbors through the walls, so we did not get as much sleep as we would have liked. We complained about the noise to the front desk, but our neighbors did not get any quieter. The location of the hotel was great though; we walked to the BOK Center and it took less than 10 minutes.

I really needed to get my nails done and with my erratic schedule, I was forced to find a salon in a strange city, so I called the front desk and spoke to Ashley who not only found one but made an appointment for me!
