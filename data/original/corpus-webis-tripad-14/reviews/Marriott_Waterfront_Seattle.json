Walked to Anthony's Pier 66 for dinner and Elliot's for lunch. Quick drive to Key Arena and about 20 minute drive to Ray's Boathouse for dinner. Pretty quick access to I-5 to Woodinville for wine tastings. Property is clean and well kept. Stopped in excecise room - looks decent - indoor and outdoor pool combo too.

If I had been staying longer, I would have asked if I could get another lamp. Internet worked well and although it was $10/day, I have paid more at other properties.
