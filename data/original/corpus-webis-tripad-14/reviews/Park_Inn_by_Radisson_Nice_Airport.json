We were given room 117, before we entered the room, there is this terrible smell at the entrance. When we open the room, it was even worst like sewage has flooded the room. I knocked on next door room 118 to check if that is the latest French Perfume used by the hotel. Room 118 was alright. The guests in Room 118 agree that our room smell horrible. I went down to the reception to report the problem and ask for a room change. The girl at the counter told me the hotel is fully booked and they cannot change the room for me. There are 151 rooms and all fully occupied in mid-Oct!!! She offer to fix the odour problem by spraying more chemical. I mentioned that if this can be fixed, house-keeping should have done it when they are cleaning it today. The manager then offer to go to the room to check it out himself. He agreed that there is the bad odour and again ask me to put up for one night as they are fully booked and they will give me a new room for my second night. I refuse to sleep in the room and ask the manager to move the bed to the corridor, I am quite happy to sleep by the lift. Finally he make a phone call and told me there is another room available and he show me room 123 which is fine like any hotel room.", "title": "Smelly room and poor service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LovTravelOz", "date": "October 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 119883562}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Very poor service, expecting the guest to put up with the sewage smell.

I found this very offensive that they thought it acceptable to dish up such poor food. They didn't even comment when I pointed out that part of it was burnt.
