I have not been overly impressed with the lodging choices in Lake George but the Park Lane was clean, comfortable, and walking distance to the whole village. It is obvious the owner really takes pride in his property and the staff is very nice as well. Everyone from the receptionist to the room attendants were friendly and always asked if there was anything I wanted. Like most of the motels in this area it is old but very well maintained and spotless. The room was small but that was the way they were built. However it looked like it had been recently painted and was very comfortable. There were tables and chairs on the balcony so I could visit with my neighbors which is something that has been lost in the newer hotels. The price was reasonable for Americade motorcycle rally week so this may be my go to place for lodging whenever I visit Lake George.", "title": "A very good motel stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Yankee_Biker", "date": "June 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 163280234}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Just want you to know my family and I spend a good part of our summer in Lake George and we stay at Park Lane Motel.
