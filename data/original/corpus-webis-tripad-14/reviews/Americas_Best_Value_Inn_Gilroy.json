The price is very good, one of the cheapest hotels I have stayed at in a long time. Also the bed was comfortable enough, so no problem there, and the refrigerator worked well. And I was a little concerned about traffic noise but that was no problem. However it is not up to the standards of the recent reviews I read here making it the number one hotel in Gilroy. Yes, the front desk was very accomodating, no complaints there. But the room was very substandard. The carpet was dirty, the furniture was worn, the chairs at the desks were all stained. Also the mirror over the sink was broken at the corner and the wallpaper adjoining it was peeling. So maybe we got the worst room in the place? Finally many reviews rave about the breakfast. It was the worst breakfast I have seen at a hotel. It is supposed to be from 6 to 9 am. We got there at 8:30 and there was virtually nothing there. Again, great price but very disappointing nonetheless.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Skytrekker", "date": "January 28, 2013", "id": 150862896}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled on business", "text": "We had a lovely stay in this hotel.

Must be family owned....like it's a hassle for the person to come to the front desk. We went back and forth with the front desk woman about having a smoking vs non-smoking room listed in the reservation - why, we were the only people there. She gave us the room and it smelled horrible. Maybe it was a smoking room before....who knows, but it was bad. We opened the window and that helped a bit, but you can only stand so much of hearing people's car idle and listening to them order food at the Burger King drive through....yes, she gives us the room closest when the whole place is empty. We stayed regardless, but if I had to do it again, I would have left. The room just seemed crappy even with the mircrowave and refrigerator.

The carpet in the room was a little dirty, like it needed a good shampooing, but other than that, my room was clean, and the hotel cleaning staff was very friendly. They had the best shower pressure that I have EVER experienced in a hotel, and they had those really cool, new, low-flow, energy-efficient toilets. I wasn't sure about the bed at first glance, it looked quite flimsy, but it was actually very comfortable, as were the pillows. I woke up late on my last day there and was in a rush to get out by the 11 AM checkout time. As a result, I left behind something very important. They held onto it for me and I was able to pick it up when I returned to the area a few weeks later.
