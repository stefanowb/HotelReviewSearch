The hotel was very easy to find and there is plenty of free parking. On arrival we were slightly put off by the external appearance of the building, but once inside it is absolutely lovely. Check in was very quick with a very polite and friendly receptionist and our ground floor room, although through quite a maze of corridors, was large, clean, comfortable and air conditioned, with a very decent sized bathroom and plenty of towels. We were impressed by the pillow ordering service which meant we both were totally comfortable, my husband phoned down for pillows and within 5 minutes they were delivered to the room. The bed itself was very comfortable. When my husband realised he had forgotten to bring a razor and shaving cream he phoned reception who were very quick to bring this to the room. The breakfast choice was extensive, hot and tasty, the restaurant staff were very friendly and efficient. We also used the pool facilities and the staff there were also friendly, the pool itself isn't particuarly big and on the shallow side but well heated and considering how inexpensive the trip was, it was impressive to have such facilities! We didn't eat dinner in the restaurant either night so can't comment on that, but it was easy enough to find other places to eat - central Chester is very near by as is the leisure park adjacent to the Cheshire Oaks retail village which has several restaurants to choose from.
