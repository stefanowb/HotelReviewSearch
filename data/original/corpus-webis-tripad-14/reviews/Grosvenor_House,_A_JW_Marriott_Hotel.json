Restaurants in the area are fab. Had a wonderful meal in KAI - by far the best chinnese meal I ever had. Worth travelling to London just for that.

As someone who is used to quality and personal JW Marriott service in the states, I was quite frankly shocked. My second complaint occurred when we were leaving. The day before we left, my husband checked with the concierge desk about getting a taxi early in the morning to the airport. He was assured that it would not be a problem on New Year's Day. The next morning when we were leaving, we could not find a doorman and this was at 9 AM!!!! Nor could we find someone at the concierge desk. We had to get someone from the front desk to go behind the concierge desk to look for the doorman. Apparently he was too busy socializing with the concierge that morning. As I waited for my husband at the door, several other hotel guests came out of the hotel looking for a cab. After standing around for awhile, those guests decided to walk to the main street to look for a cab.
