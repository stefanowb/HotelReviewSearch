The main positive is the apartment style concept - which offers great space and flexibility. The apartments are nicely designed and have everything you would expect (including free WiFi). The location is also good - in a smart, residential part of the city. The main downside is the service - which although friendly, is minimal and many of the staff only speak Portuguese. There is a restaurant - but the food is pretty average and there is not much atmosphere. Certainly, of you want space and like an apartment concept, this is a good option - but if you are looking for a hotel, then you maybe disappointed.", "title": "Spacious but with minimal service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Globaladventure", "date": "September 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 140054372}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled on business", "text": "My husband and I stayed here for a few months and it was excellent.
