The complimentary breakfast was fantastic - scrambled eggs, fresh waffles, sausage, bacon, cereal, muffins, juice, etc. All the children found their favorites! When you have 10 people to feed a nourishing breakfast at a restaurant, it really adds up! (The large \"restaurant style\" room was very homey and inviting.)

We obviously received one that previously was a smoking room & when we mentioned this at check-out, we were given a \"very generous\" reduction in our bill! We felt more than compensated.
