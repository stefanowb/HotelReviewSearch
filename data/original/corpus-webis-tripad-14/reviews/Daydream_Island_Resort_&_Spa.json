The resort was pretty full and there were lots of kids but it didn't seem like there were any special facilities or programs for them. I was there by myself after a business trip so I was mainly looking for relaxation. The day spa is really wonderful- clean, beautiful and lots of things to choose. I had two treatments and both were fantastic- I would have booked more but many of the times were already taken with advance bookings. Like other reviews, I found the food to be poor quality (except at Mermaids) and the restaurant system to be bizarre and the lack of room service to be disappointing. Overall, I found the staff to be highly unprofessional and not friendly. On two occassions, I witnessed staff arguing with each other in front of guests and most of the time the staff would walk past me without saying hello. The room was ok though a bit less than what I would expect of 4-star (as the resort advertises). I feel like it was a lot of money for what it was in the end.
