We got the bargain room I guess which was an outside wood staircase in good condition was not very slippery in the rain. There is no elevator in the 2 story hotel. There are a lot of rooms downstairs with indoor access. The beds are incredibly comfortable, rooms average to larger than a motel, and very comfortable. The pool was nice and warm and clean, and the jacuzzi was good about the size of a queen sized bed in width and about 8-10 feet long, about 8 people could fit max, needless to say it was popular but not overcrowded. The location is busy as it is IN the shopping outlet parking lot, a shoppers Mecca if you are into that, we were there for a restful weekend and ended up coming home with lots of purchases. The restaurant on the premises (not adjoined) was great for dinner, don't get room service just call and walk over to pick up or go order the menu is more extensive and you save on the gratuity charge.The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is Pub fare, very delicious, the first night I ordered hot wings and got 'to die for' wings with an amazing sauce, not too hot, the next night I ordered the same thing and got just buffalo wings. Maybe a different cook? However DO NOT HAVE THE BREAKFAST BUFFET!!!! Overpriced for sub standard food, they were low on everything, and even when replenished it was generic, waffles were melting, omelets bad, sausage links were probably Swift Premium brown and serve. We had an amazing breakfast at the Tamarack Inn just the right amount food, of tasty potatoes awesome homemade bread etc.", "title": "Better Than Expected", "user": "Myrts78", "date": "October 16, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 47024433}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed with my wife and 2 very young kids and have no a single complaint.", "title": "Very comfortable roomy suite", "user": "Juan Cruz P", "date": "September 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 44267413}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The two bedroom suite is excellent, very roomy and comfortable, A king bed for the couple, a queen for one kid and a crib for the baby.

While planning a short trip to the Great Escape Lodge waterpark I spent hours looking for lodging that would give our 19 month old a seperate room to sleep. I am familiar with the area and couldn't find a thing. The only thing that might have worked in the waterpark lodge did not look like it had a door on the room and 2 nights would have cost over $700. I have no problem spending that amount of money if I am going to be staying at a four or five star establishment but that was not going to be the case here. Most of the Lake George resorts and vacation rentals are seasonal. I was about to reserve a 3 bedroom cabin in Hauge when I came across the Clarion. Calling the hotel I spoke to a friendly, helpful front desk person who understood my needs. The room was wonderful....spacious and very clean. The seperate bedroom with a king bed had french doors with frosted glass and a flat screen tv. My son set up his crib in there. The main room had a sitting area with couch, coffee table, sink , fridge,microwave and flat screen tv... the sleeping area had a queen bed. Bed was extreamly comfortable. Two dresser and a large closet for plenty of storage space. I was shocked over the niceness of the bathroom. There was an entrance from the main room and the bedroom. Tiled floor, beautiful countertop. A pocket door seperated the sink from the toilet and bath area. Deep jetted tub and seperated shower. Neutrogena toiletries. In a pinch we went to the hotel restaurant, again what a surprise! Usually would not be a choice but this place was actually good!We travel a lot and I stay away from almost all chain hotels because they are so hit and miss, with the odds in favor of miss. I like a nice place and have been called a room snob.

The bed was moderately comfortable. The air conditioner was at body level so that it blew directly on my husband while sleeping at night...the vent could not be redirected. The courtesy continental breakfast was O.K., though my kids loved being able to stuff themselves with store bought donuts and fruitloops (they also had pastries, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cold cereal, bagels, assorted breads/spreads, coffee/tea and juices). Again the carpet was soiled, the fabric chairs were stained, and many of the bowls didn't have serving utensils...how were all these people retrieving the food?
