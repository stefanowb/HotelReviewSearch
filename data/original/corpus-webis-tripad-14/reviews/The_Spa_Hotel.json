Our room although being nicely decorated, and having a spacious luxury bathroom was tiny. We really struggled to fit our travel cot in. We ate lunch at the hotel and had to feed my son bits from our plates as there was no provision made for small children. Ordered him a fruit salad - which at 5 pounds was really overpriced. We didn't eat dinner in the restaurant as again there was no kids meals (althougth the menu for adults sounded nice). Used the swimming pool which although not the biggest was nice for a dip, and the underfloor heating at the poolside was super cosy. Not sure about the guy swimming in his underwear - glad he left soon after we went in!!! Nice selection at breakfast, but again not really catering for the kids. The waitress fetched a highchair which by looking at the dirt on it isn't used very often. The straps were broken, so spent breakfast trying to keep a grip on a mountain climbing 1yr old and munching on my toast. Between that and the constant looks from the manager, we didn't have the most relaxing start to the day. For couples then this hotel is perfect for a nice getaway. For families give this one a miss.", "user": "XXXKent", "date": "April 15, 2008", "id": 15047227}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 26, "average": 44, "very good": 102, "terrible": 26, "excellent": 76}, "aka": "The Hotel Royal Tunbridge Wells", "slim_ranking": 0.454545454545, "description": "This 18th century mansion is blessed with glorious gardens, great bedrooms and a leisure club.
