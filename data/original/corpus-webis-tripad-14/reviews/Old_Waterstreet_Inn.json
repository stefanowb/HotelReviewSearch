Wine and cheese at 5:30pm on the weekends. Jeanne & Eric are unbelievably accommodating, making sure the fireplace was burning in the common room as well as set-up ready to go in our room. Our room, the Winesap Room, was very romantic. Wood fireplace, comfortable queen bed, heated tile floors in the bathroom. We always had water and fresh towels. The best thing about the place is that it is a great getaway...We had plenty of privacy but somehow always felt like if we needed anything we had great hosts to provide it for us. Winchester is a small town, but is one of the most charming places we've ever visited...It is simple but in the most refreshing and uplifting way.
