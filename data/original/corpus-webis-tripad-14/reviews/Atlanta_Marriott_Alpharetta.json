We debated staying in Alpharetta due to the distance away from Atlanta. Being right off of GA 400 this hotel is quite a drive from downtown Atlanta however close to the North Point Mall and several restaurants. We visited Lake Lanier Islands and the N Georgia Premium outlets which were only about 30 minutes away. Our last stay in downtown Atlanta at the Marriott Marquis 8/2006 was dreadful. The Marriott Alpharetta was simply a flawless stay. Downtown Atlanta doesn't have much to offer at night, other than Hard Rock Cafe and who wants to hassle with valet parking. The Marriott Alpharetta however offers free self parking. The hotel exceeded our expectations. We booked a King Room with breakfast included (either in room or hotel restaurant) through Marriott.com. Being Marriott Rewards/Elite Members we expect each stay to be perfect which this one was. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. Overall, very nice hotel, clean rooms and a very comfortable bed.", "title": "Dec 27- Dec 30 Great Hotel!!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Mikeucfknights", "date": "January 9, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6568457, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean Rooms, Pleasant Staff and Great Breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 Distance from MARTA trains, Park & Ride is nearby"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great hotel for business travelers", "text": "I recently stayed here on a business trip and we really enjoyed our stay.
