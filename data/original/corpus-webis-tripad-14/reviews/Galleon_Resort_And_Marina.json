If you can't get a one or two bedroom suite assigned to you don't accept this bottom of the barrel room. Make reservations on your own instead. Small, cramped, dark and shabby. No view except for elevator and outside wall. Could not open drapes as people stood outside of room waiting for elevator and couldn't help themselves from looking into room. The AC rattled and kicked-in every 15 minutes throughout the night making sleeping nearly impossible. The kitchenette was located between the bathroom and bedroom. It consisted of a microwave, under-cabinet refrigerator on one side of the 3 foot hall and a sink, coffee maker and cabinets on the other side. Dishes, glassware, utensils, a dishcloth and dish washing liquid were provided. However, no salt/pepper or napkins were provided. You will need to do some shopping if you wish to make breakfast. We purchased items from the Galleon Tiki Bar deli (on the marina side of the hotel) and CVS a few blocks away the corner of Duval.", "title": "Fabulous Resort - Horrible RCI Room", "user": "ChampagnePrincess", "date": "January 1, 2014", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 189244227}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We were not provided any help from the front desk in regard to upgrading our room as we were \"RCI\" members.
