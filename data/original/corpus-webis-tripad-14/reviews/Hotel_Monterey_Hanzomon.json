The hotel was small but that was really of no surprise to us as that seems to be the trend in Japan. Everything was tastefully decorated and overall kept quite clean. The location just couldn't be beat. We were able to walk to the Imperial Gardens and the main shopping district and there were tons of great little restaurants and cafe's in the area. The hotel itself was a little difficult to get to on the subway system from the airport but that was mainly because we didn't know which line to transfer to when we arrived in Tokyo station. You can either try to figure it out or just take a taxi. It should only be about $15.

Fantastic location, right in the center of town, with the Hanzomon Subway station right across the street (it\u2019s a small station, and you hardly even notice the entrance). The rates here are great. I booked two superior singles for my mother and I, and paid approximately $90 USD per night, per room. Considering there are $600 USD per night hotels nearby, this is an amazing deal. The hotel is an immaculately decorated boutique hotel, with all the amenities. The furnishings make you think this hotel should be in the five star category, but it\u2019s not because the rooms are small size (just enough for two people per room). I recommend you book this hotel as there was nothing to fault. The view was great from my room, the bed was really comfortable (one of the best I have stayed in), and the furnishings make you feel like this is an incredible bargain for the price. Don\u2019t miss the breakfast buffet. It is a great way to start your sightseeing day, and is a good value considering all the offerings (Japanese and Western). If you forget your laptop, there is Internet in the lobby for around $5 USD per hour. Also noticed a nice Chinese Restaurant off the front lobby, which appeared to have many local people from the neighborhood eating there. There are small cafes, coffee shops, a Texas style BBQ, an Indian restaurant, and convenience stores within a stones throw, so you\u2019ll have plenty of choices. The Hanzomon subway station is located directly across the street, but BEWARE, when you get off at Hanzomon there are apparently three exits which can take you topside a few blocks away. This confused the heck out of us late one night. My suggestion is to take note of how things look when entering the station across the hotel so you can choose the correct exit topside. It\u2019s a long flight of stairs and is a pain in the behind to have to go back down and figure it out after a long day.", "title": "Fantastic location, upscale and affordable!", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "California_Wine", "date": "February 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13189420, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Price, cleanliness, location, ammenities"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with family", "text": "The verdict: I can\u2019t fault this hotel for anything.

The room I had was non smoking, but unfortunately there was a stale odour of cigarette somke in the room - I am sure people have smoked in the room. The location of the hotel was quite good. It is accross the road from exit 5 of Hanzomon metro station - has to be the easiest hotel in Toktyo to find. Buy yourself an all day metro ticket for Yen 1000 ( which will let you travel on all metro lines) except \"JR\" and you can see a lot of Tokyo. If you want to eat near the hotel there are a few restaurants to your left. If you are not into Japanese food, then walk about 1 km to your left as you exit the hotel or if you are in Hanzomon station itself go out exit 2, Macdonalds and Starbucks plus other cafes and restaraunts are near by.
