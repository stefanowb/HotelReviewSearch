Club Med has a huge strip of beach so you are never on top of other people, which is nice. Lounge chairs on the beach vary widely. Some are rock hard and downright impossibly painful to lay on, but others have cushioning and are fine. You do need to get up fairly early to reserve chairs, esp if you want shade (which we did since we spent all day at the beach and the sun is harsh). Club Med has signs posted that if you leave your chair for 45 mins or more, you lose it, but that was never enforced. Beware different cultural norms if you are American: lots of french people always seemed to be smoking near me, with the smoke blowing at me, which pissed me off. One German woman in her 60's felt free to take off her bikini bottom on the beach to change into another one, in front of me, her husband, another couple they were traveling with, and everyone else on the beach- yikes!!! Water was a little too cold for me to enjoy it on a regular basis, which was unfortunate but refreshing to take dips in every now and again. Do NOT take a float out into the ocean, as there is a huge undertow and you will quickly float very far away from shore.

Vegetables, salads and fruit are awsome. Did I mention that the deserts were great? You can't eat 3 whole meals without gaining weight. I opted to eat light at breakfast. Rooms are very clean and the shower is great to get cleaned up. The toilet is separate from the bathroom area. There are so many activities do do at this village (catamaran sailing, snorkel, scuba, kayak, wind surfing, trapezee, swim, basketball, tennis, boce ball, workout, etc.). Sharkies is a place to go late at night for snacks and drinks during the day, while you're on the beach. I would definitely return.

The food was excellent -- they tried every kind of culture and did a really good job. And another good thing about the food/eating/dining was that they seated you at a different table with different people every meal. We met so many interesting people this way. We even met a couple that we hung out with almost the rest of the time (they were closer to our age, upper 20s). I felt like staying there for five days was not enough time because there are SO many things to do there (trapezing, snorkeling, salsa dancing, windsurfing, sailing, etc.) We didn't even get to do a lot of the things we wanted to do because I really just wanted to lay on the breathtaking white, white beach and get in the blue, blue water. The water is the most pristine you will ever see. And the shows at night, sure, they are by the GO's but I thought they were perfectly entertaining and I thought they did a very good job.
