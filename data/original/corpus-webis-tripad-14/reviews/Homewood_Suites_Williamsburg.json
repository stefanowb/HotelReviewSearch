The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. We had a small problem at check-in, but Erin at the front desk handled it quickly, professionally and with an apology. Erin continued to be helpful throughout our stay..... answering all of our questions..... always with a smile. The breakfast was nice. We did not take advantage of the dinners, so I can't comment on that. Our only complaint would be that the temperature in the room was difficult to control..... We tended to be either too cold or too warm.

Very convenient to food and historic areas and Busch Gardens. We always get a 2bedroom 2 bathroom suite. The room size is amazing for families. You can get 1 King,1 Queen and 1 pullout sofa or 1 King 2 Queens and 1 pullout sofa which is what we get. TVs in all three rooms plus the kitchette really saves time and money. They have free breakfast every morning and free dinner Mon-Thur. Our kids love the pool it is very large for a hotel pool.

The hotel is exceptionally convenient to Colonial Williamsburg, and to the Colonial Parkway to get to Jamestown and Yorktown. The hotel seemed clean enough, our room wasn't ready at 5:00 pm when we arrived. The maids could do a better job of vacuuming the rooms --- crumbs that we had spilled near the couch on our first night were still there the morning that we left! The suite does have a full kitchen - full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher and plates, pots and utensils, if that is important to you. The free breakfast was adequate - scrambled eggs, sausage, rolls, bagels, cereals, fruit and danishes. Only a small selection of juice and coffee -- no soft drinks. The free evening reception on Monday - Thursday was nothing special... we ate some salad one day, but skipped it the other days... Eat at Huzzah in CW - it was exceptionally good, especially the crabcake sandwich. Also our meal at Christiana Cambell's tavern in CW was very good.
