The room was quiet despite being on a main street and it was very clean and tidy. I would definitely visit Paris and stay in the Elysa Luxembourg again.

It takes no more than 15-20 minutes, on the RER, from Gare du Nord to the nearest station, Luxembourg. Many of the major tourist sites are within easy strolling distance, for example, Notre Dame is approximately 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Close to the hotel is a large selection of restaurants offering every cuisine you can think of at prices to suit all budgets. My friend and I (two older ladies) felt entirely safe and unthreatened in this vibrant, bustling and very lively area. However, we were concerned that our room would be noisy at night, particularly, as our room faced directly onto the main road. Surprisingly, we found that noise from the street just wasn't an issue and the insulation between rooms in the hotel was also very good. If you like to sleep with the window open at night, then you probably will be distrurbed by the street-life. When we were there, the nights were very warm and sultry however, the air conditioning in the room was both effective and very quite and so we had no need to open the window. I've visited Paris on many occasions, and I'd say that this is one of the quietest hotels I've stayed at. On arrival, and during our stay, the hotel staff were helpful and friendly and they were happy to converse in English (fluently) without making us feel guilty or inadequate about our total lack of French. Our twin room and well-equipped bathroom were both spotlessly clean and surprisingly good-sized rooms bearing in mind that Paris hotel rooms are notoriously small. At no time did we feel that we, or our possessions, were at any risk.

Sheltered from the bustle of the busiest thoroughfares, the Elysa-Luxembourg hotel combines the charm of a beautiful old stone building, the cosy interior of rooms decorated in contemporary style with the efficiency of modern facilities. Some of the thirty rooms offer a magnificent view over neighbouring rooftoops, the paths through the nearby Luxemburg gardens or even the Eiffel Tower. In this discretely refined setting, the atmosphere is decisively warm and the service resolutely attentive."}
