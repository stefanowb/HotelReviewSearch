Ok so things are not cheap here but who gets to see sleeping beauty in the lobby and have Mickey, Minnie, Goofie and Pluto come say good morning to you at breakfast? By Hong Kong standards the service here was beyond imaginable! The only comment I would make is that the room service menu for kids is very weak. There are only 2 dishes and if your kid does not eat beef or pork you don't have anything else to feed her with.

The kingdom club rooms are fabulous, worth the extra. The view from the room balcony is out of the world. Its not just about the kids getting to live their dreams, though that was the deciding factor for us. The indoor pool is great - late oct, the outdoor pool was a bit chilly for us - and the enchanted garden character bf is a delight for the little ones. The staff is efficient, though we felt that the warmth is lacking. some scope for improvement there, IMHO. The gift shop is a life saver for last minute emergencies.

We had a late checkin - 10pm - so was very quick service. We paid extra for an ocean view - trees are too big, so wouldn't bother next time. We didn't have a balcony, so our room was that much bigger. Two double beds & a double couch & coffee table. Loads of space. Beds felt TINY, big people would struggle. Breakfast in the Enchanted Garden with Mickey etc was THE BEST THING EVER. Well worth the AUD$100. Such a huge variety on the buffet, but that's just a bonus. The characters were sensational. Greeting all the kids (big & small) at all tables. No problems to get loads of photos. Even I got a big hug was Pluto! The pool was great too. 2-3 guards on constant duty. The water slide is VERY sedate & you need to push yourself along - but meant my unadventurous son would do go on it by himself. There was a good bar near the pool - but as for bars, not much happening there. Apart from the fancy Chinese restaurant (which is too fancy for the generally simple tastes of a little kid), there was nowhere to go for an evening drink. Disneyland was walking distance - probably about 300m along a pleasant looking walkway - but we'd just come for cold Melbourne & struggled with the heat - the shuttle bus came ever 10 mins & took <5 mins.
