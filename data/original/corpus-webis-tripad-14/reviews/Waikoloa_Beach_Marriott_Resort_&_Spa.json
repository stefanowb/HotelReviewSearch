We would go back and my only beef was the constant cigarette smoke. The hotel is actually a nonsmoking facility which makes the fact that we choked from cigarette smoke day and night a big disappointment. What happens at this hotel is that MANY people smoke on their balconies even though they are included in the nonsmoking area. The reason it is an issue here is that the balconies are in very close proximity and are small in about 3/4 of the hotels rooms. If you do not mind going to Hawaii and keeping you balcony doors closed all of the time it would be paradise. The hotel staff and manager were very nice and concerned however they have very poor in room explanation of their smoking policy so I think the smokers actually think you can smoke on the balconies,as this was not just one person, at least 5 people around us. We woke up as early as 7am to a room filled with cigarette smoke. This hotel would be better off with smoking sections if it does not have the policy either better defined or enforced.
