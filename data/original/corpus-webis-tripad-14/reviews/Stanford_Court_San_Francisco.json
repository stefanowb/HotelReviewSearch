I booked our stay as a combination hotel/car package through the Marriott website, which saves money ($550 for 4 nights with economy car, and includes all taxes) but also creates a couple of problems: (1) you cannot specify the type of room or bed; and (2) you have to find somewhere to park your car; the hotel valet costs about $43 per night. When we checked in, the desk clerk tried to get us to \"upgrade\" our room to a queen non-smoking ($30 more per night) or a king ($50 more per night). We decided to stay with the room she offered (a queen in an \"optional\" smoking room), and the room turned out to be smoke-free, with a nice view. It was a bit dated, but perfectly adequate--I would rank it as a 3.5 star. Our room overlooked the cable car intersection, but the noise wasn't that bad. As for the parking, it turns out there is a small parking lot right across the street from the hotel, which charges $20 a day (no in-and-out privileges, however). You can also park at the lot for $15 for up to 12 hours. This is a bargain as the commercial garages in the Nob Hill area charge about $3 for every 20 minutes, with maximums of $27-$31 a day.", "title": "Good Location for Nob Hill, So-So Rooms", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "pashber", "date": "March 16, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3277408}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2005, traveled on business", "text": "The greatest advantage of this hotel is the proximity to the other hotels on Nob Hill.

Their attitude was bad enough -- but the bed was absolutely horrid. And I'm not talking size -- I'm talking the absence of even minimal comfort. My husband and I rolled toward a depression in the middle of the bed, and it felt as if the bed had no padding whatsoever. It was so hard that my hip bones ached the next morning. The only difference between the bed and the floor would have been that, if we had slept on the floor, we wouldn't have rolled together. We didn't ask for or expect much of a view, but the windows opened to a dark alley and a view of the moldy wall of the building across the alleyway.

The first of the three centred holiday (moving on to Vegas and then Longbeach, LA). We had a fabulaous welcome at the hotel - nothing was too much trouble. Our room was situated on the 4th floor / corner room. It was spacious, comfortable (especially the beds), and clean, with pretty good views. It was rated by our travel agent as a 4*, which seems a pretty fair reflection. The breakfast buffet was the only thing to let the hotel down. But we'd highly recommend ordering from the breakfast menu, which was slightly more costly, but everything is made to order. The lemon souffle pancakes with raspberries were fantastic! We found the location of the hotel to be very convenient, especially as the cable car line runs directly outside the entrance. The most economical way to travel, is to buy a MUNI passport (which can be bought at the information desk at the airport - $24 per person, for a 1 week pass). When you add up the cost of every 'single' trip cable car ticket costing $5, the passport was exceptional value. It can be used without limit on ANY of the Muni transport around the city i.e. - cable cars/ electric trams/ trolley buses/ & 'bendy' buses. We found these passports invaluable, and we hardly used taxis nor the hotel limo service, (which is provided on a first come first serve basis). Despite public transport being very accessible, if you've never been to the city before, be prepared to do a lot of walking (so comfortable, flat shoes are a must).
