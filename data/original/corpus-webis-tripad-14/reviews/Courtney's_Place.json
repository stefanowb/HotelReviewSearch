My husband and I were in unit 18-it was just okay-When we first got there it was nighttime and was a little creepy-They knew we were coming in late, but didn't bother to leave the light on-so we had a bit of difficulty finding our unit. The next day we heard the cleaning folks working behind our unit-it seems that the washing machine is in a shed behind our room. It was a bit noisy in the afternoon-We like to take afternoon naps, but it wasn't possible here. The hispanic woman at the office in the mornings was not polite at all-she was bothered when we showed up 15 minutes too early for coffee-she had a male friend who was there with her who was smoking in the kitchen area-Not impressed with her at all! The room seemed pretty clean-the shower head was terrible and hardly had any water pressure at all-but at least we had a shower. The windows in the bedroom were made of plexiglass and they had gaps in them that would allow in the bugs- There wasn't any room to put our luggage in this unit-very small-but we were told this at the time of our reservation. Overall okay-we've stayed in worse and we've stayed in a whole lot better! We looked at another unit and are definately considering visiting again-just in another room. The location was great! Nice neighborhood-at first the alley was a little creepy, but was okay and we felt more comfortable the longer we stayed. We'll go back, just not in #18.

We have stayed there twice, once in May in one of the private rooms and again in November in one of the private cottages. I recommend a private cottage if you are a couple who prefer peace & solitude. I agree with previous reviewers that the sheets don't stay on the bed, but you can get these straps at linen stores that hold the sheets on. Our cottage even had central air & heat (which came in handy since there was a cold front and temp in Key West dipped into the 40s & 50s overnight). The breakfast is very basic, but at their prices, that is fine. We took our dog, who is 1 yr old, and he was more than wlecome.

We travelled with a medium size dog. Courtney's is very pet friendly (however our dog was freaked by the number of cats around Key West and how surly the cats could be. I even got clawed by one when it tried to attack my dog!). Nikki, in the front office, was always very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Breakfast was always plentiful, good, and fun to chat with others. Staff was considerate about not entering when dog was present in the cottage (we just left a sign letting them know whether we needed service or not). As mentioned by others, the sheets didn't fit the king bed. However, that's because the mattress was extra thick and the best bed I've ever slept on in a hotel/motel. C17 has it's own parking spot so no problems with parking (except when maint. workers parked there once). The kitchen was great and sufficiently stocked with supplies. We walked everywhere since you're a couple of blocks to central Duval Street in one direction and convenience mart/dog walking park in the other.
