Motel 6 has more to offer than this place, at least there you know what to expect. Make sure you get to the \"complimentary\" breakfast super early, otherwise they may be sold out of 1/2 the menu items. People who rave about this place don't know any better.

We initially booked a room in the Carriage House. The room was not huge, but there was a king bed, a futon for our daughter, and a private patio with a hot tub. It was clean and well appointed. Our only problem with the room was that the high-speed internet access did not work. We tried everything we could think of to get online and couldn\u2019t do it. By the morning after our first night, the phone no longer worked, either. We informed the staff of this problem and were told that someone would take care of it. An hour or two later, we were told that their staff could not fix the problem and that they\u2019d have to bring someone in to take care of it. They then offered us a room in the \u201cLuxury Suites\u201d building (a short walk outside of town) for the remainder of our stay at no extra charge as compensation. The room we ended up in was much larger with a foldout bed for our daughter, a huge bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub and sauna, another private patio with hot tub, and a lovely common area with newspapers, dining room, computer, etc. We felt they really went beyond what most hotels are willing to do these days to insure that we\u2019d be happy with our stay. Apart from handling the issues with the room, the staff were friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was served each morning in the main dining room (necessitating a much-needed walk into town) and it was quite good. My only gripe was that the portions were too big compared to what I like to eat in the morning. All of the food was delicious, though. We ate supper in the MacCallum House restaurant one evening and found that to be quite good as well. It was a bit pricey, but everything was very well-prepared and service was good. (If you like such things, be sure to try the ginger-rye cocktail \u2013 it was stellar.)

After researching thru TripAdvisor, and checking out MacCallum's website - noting the \"Slow Season\" Sun-Thurs special - first night regular price, 2nd night 60% off - I reserved Cottage #10, the Carriage House for 2 nights. We were NOT disapointed - it was a beautiful drive up from the Bay Area (although as other reviewers have mentioned, both Hwys 20 and 128 can be a bit on the nauseatingly winding side...). The moment we entered the main house we were treated very well by the MacCallum staff (we have stayed at four and five star hotels and so we know good service!). Loved our room, and enjoyed the hot tub immensely, along with the 4 pm wine and beer hour, which I haven't seen mentioned in any reviews here - very relaxing, the bartender was terrific and of course very service-oriented as were all the folks there. Visiting with the other guests during that hour was relaxing and friendly. And the BREAKFAST was to die for - loved that bacon. The king-sized bed in our room was comfy, and the Franklin stove a nice romantic touch.
