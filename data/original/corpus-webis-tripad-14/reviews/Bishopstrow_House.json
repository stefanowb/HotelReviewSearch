The bed was also very comfortable, not at all like the typical \u201csaggy country house mattress\u201d referred to in a previous review.

At least one door handle was only held on by one screw and where screws had been replaced they were done so inexpertly. In a well maintained hotel I do not expect to see brass door furniture held on by a mixture of steel and black screws. In addition, virtually none of the blinds in any of the rooms worked properly. The cords had obviously broken on many occasions and had either been repaired by knotting the ends together or had just been left broken. It meant that all of the curtains hung at a jaunty angle.
