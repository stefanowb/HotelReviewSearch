The room was lovely and clean and really comfortable. We had lunch at Jimmy B's which was tasty and quick, Sara behind the bar was also friendly and nice. Live music started at 3.30pm with a solo male singer playing guitar who was fab. Sat at the bar in afternoon reading a book and relaxing to his singing. The hotel has two pools and is on the beach so spolit for choice of where to soak up the sun. We also went to the sister hotel, Grand Plaza at sundown where we have a voucher from hotel for a free drink and got a complimentary 'sundown shooter'. On return to Beachcomber after dinner we sat in bar and watched a band perform who were also good. Every single member of staff we met were friendly and polite from the bar staff to the cleaners.....Would definately recommend this hotel and hopefully we will still manage to get a room when we return to St Petes next year. lol.

The walkway leading toward the beach was an excellent spot to enjoy a drink and watch the amazing sunsets. Jimmy B's provideds free \"sunset shooters\" every evening just before sunset - very tasty! Rooms were a bit dated but clean with comfortable beds. On-site entertainment at Jimmy B's was hit or miss - there was a one man guitar player who was rather good, but we found the Reggie Band to be \"sad\" and \"unentertaining\" - but this entertainment is free so that's a big plus. Jimmy B's attracts many of the locals and was very busy on Friday and Saturday nights which made for an interesting \"people watching\" experience for our group.
