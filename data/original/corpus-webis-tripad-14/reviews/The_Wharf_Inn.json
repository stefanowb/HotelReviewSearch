The location could not be better, being that it is one block away from Fisherman's Wharf and walking distance to all the attractions in that area (Ghiradelli, Cable Cars, Alcatraz Docks, etc.). The hotel staff was very pleasant and allowed early check-in with zero hassle. The rooms look to have been recently updated, are clean, and have comfortable beds. The only downside to this place is what I have noticed consistently comes up in reviews, and that is the noise level. Because the hotel looks to have been built many decades ago, the walls are extremely thin and are not insulated. Every closing door sounds like a slam, and whenever someone walks down the hall it is noticable. The place was no noisier than any other hotel, but the sounds are much more amplified because of the lack of insulation. My husband and I didn't have the most restful night due to the sounds coming from outside the room, but that can be easily overlooked because all in all the Wharf Inn was a great value.", "title": "Great Value, just beware light sleepers!", "user": "LovetoTravelSD", "date": "March 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 25962596}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel was clean and comfortable and was right on Fishermans Wharf.

Free car parking is very much a bonus (Holiday Inn charges $25 per day for guest parking), and we never moved the car again until we checked out. The Desk staff were courteous and incredibly helpful. We stayed here for 3 nights in late September in 2 king rooms with balconies at the front of the hotel. The rooms were large and nicely decorated and the beds extremely comfortable. The bathroom had a walk-in shower (no bath) and was more than adequate (we never had an issue with water temperature at all during our stay like other posts on here). We were on the second floor and they have a small elevator, so no dragging lugage up flights of stairs, which was good. Location is everything in San Francisco and the Wharf certainly delivers! Everything is so conveniently placed - grocery store doing breakfasts and Subway across the street, Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 for Alcatraz just minutes walk away, as are the cable cars. We only ever heard noise in the morning as the refuse truck came round at about 6am. We never heard a peep out of any other guests at all, whether we were just 'lucky' or not, I don't know. There seems to be a lot of picky people on here, and a lot of people do seem to complain about the smallest of issues such as 'no hair conditioner in the bathroom' - if this is really so important then I suggest you take a small bottle of your own with you, just in case! Please never come to England if you are picky, you will hate the accommodation unless you can afford the top dollar hotels. You will think you are 'roughing it'. Would I stay here again? Absolutely!!!! It isn't The Ritz, but it is the next best thing and totally adequate for your needs and the cheapest by far of other hotels in this location.

The folks at the front desk were nice, but they were also nice at the Sheraton when we asked to use their business center to check in on Southwest - because Wharf does not offer this service.

This is place where a Nice thing is up against a not so Nice thing. It is one block (four buildings) from the Embarcadero and the restaurant Boudin. Five blocks north from Ghirardelli Square. Nice that it is close but noisy because of it. The hotel itself is rather old in look and in fixtures, but everything is working so this is not a big deal, again nice but not so nice. The rooms have louvered windows at the front door, while this is nice for the air circulation it also lends itself to letting noise in. The walls and doors are also I suspect quite thin because noise permeates into the room from the adjacent rooms. We were unfortunate enough to have a neighbor that fell asleep next door with the TV on. So loud was that TV in fact that we had to call down and ask that it be corrected. While this was accomplished after 2 hours of listening to it, at 1 in the morning. Kudos go out to the employee that took care of this by the way, he tried calling over and over to that room and knocking on the door (remember we could hear everything!) and he did not quit. Thank you. This is a pretty big deal when you\u2019re sleeping, Noise that is. The rooms are standard, no ac just heat and a ceiling fan. Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms were clean but old and small, no bath just shower stall. The room had a smell of a citrus cleaning agent when we arrived; we left the door open for as long as possible to air out.
