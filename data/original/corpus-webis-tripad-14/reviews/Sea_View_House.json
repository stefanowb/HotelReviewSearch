What a great place! Darra and Niall are wonderful hosts and the location couldn't have been better. Doolin is a wonderful little town and a great place to use as a base to explore the area. Darra was most helpful in suggesting where to go and what to see, even making reservations for us on a boat trip to the Cliffs of Moher. Our room was clean and comfortable, giving us a good night's rest each night we were there. And the view...from the front rooms we had a picture post card view of the village and the sea in the distance. The breakfast selection was wonderful with both a buffet and made to order choices. You won't go hungry here. If you're planning a stay in Doolin I would highly recommend Sea View House.
