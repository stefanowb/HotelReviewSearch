In fact on our way there we didnt realize just how far away it was, and our taxi driver didnt quite know where he was going. That was a little frightening. When when we did arrive the staff was very helpful, arranged us cabs and rides into town and helped us with some confusion regarding our reservation and our bill. The beach is beautiful and you'll have it all to yourself.
