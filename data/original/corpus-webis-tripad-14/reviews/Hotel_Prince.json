It appears to be the best option in Bhuj and with a good modest restaurant opposite it is an attractive choice under all the circumstances. The modern facade hides a shabbier building behind. The staff are amiable if dozy. We thought they were unused to dealing with Western tourists and seemed to be more responsive to the imperious demands of some of the domestic tourists. Our suite was reasonably comfortable and quiet. We didn't manage to succeed in getting the lights fixed or one of the aircon units functioning in the few days we were there.", "title": "comfortable but no great shakes", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Boulbon", "date": "March 9, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 58143446}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Familty friend Dr Rana recommended this hotel.
