From the beautiful and romantic entry to the lovely, quiet room with a great courtyard view. THe location was great; close to a t-bana stop, city bikes station and the main N/S road for walking. We did all three during our trip. The breakfast room was pleasant and I enjoyed the waffles! The staff was friendly and helpful and kept with the romantic ambiance. I was so impressed that a hotel that Samantha Brown stayed in for a Passport to Europe episode was affordable enough for a regular couple like us. We loved it and would stay again in a hearbeat!!", "user": "dmdevl", "date": "October 14, 2009", "id": 46892952}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Interesting four star hotel", "text": "After booking a room at the sister hotel Rex we were moved to the Hellsten and upgraded.", "user": "Frunobulax", "date": "October 14, 2009", "id": 46869929}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Boutique hotel with friendly staff", "text": "The room was very large but in the basement (only a tiny window at the top of the room). (The hotel also has rooms on higher levels.) The design was very modern and stylish and the room was very clean. We had a huge comfy bed and a large TV. The bathroom contained a finnish sauna and looked new, but actually started to fall apart in several places (the toilet seat was loose, the fan wasn't working and the shower couldn't be adjusted to a fixed positon). The shower had no cabin or curtain so it showered the whole bathroom.", "user": "ChrisBros", "date": "October 6, 2009", "id": 46030490}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Super!!!", "text": "The location is located in a very quiet street north of the city center in walking distance (20 minutes) of the main attractions, but there are shops and restaurants nearby.", "user": "CarolinaAntwerpen", "date": "September 10, 2009", "id": 40534538}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "SMALL ROOMS ,BUT HOTEL WITH AMBIANCE", "text": "The breakfast room was too small, it was extremely crowded and we were lucky to find a table because other guests were just leaving.

The hotel is charming, no doubt, with authentic furniture, individually-decorated rooms, wooden floors and a trendy atmosphere. However, it is definitely not a four-star hotel. The room we stayed in was relatively small. It had no safe, no fridge. The bathroom had only two small shelves, not enough space to put any of our toiletries. There were no tissues and the towels were only medium-sized. Breakfast was OK, but not of four-star standard.", "user": "1001night", "date": "June 19, 2010", "id": 67951029}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lovely little hotel with great service", "text": "The Hellsten is a little gem of a hotel.

It was fantastic! It is a fantastic boutique style hotel with beautiful, warm, cozy, romantic (can I put any more good words here?) rooms and common areas. The front desk attendants were incredibly helpful and gave lots of advice for things to do, offered to make dinner reservations for us, and arranged to have a packed breakfast ready for us before we left for our early flight. We were given a free upgrade to the suite (no idea why, but didn't complain!) and were flabbergasted. We even had a personal lava rock sauna. The only downfall of this hotel is it is a bit of walk from the old town center or touristy areas...it took us 20-30 minutes to make the trip, but it was a nice walk. There are two other hotels in the same family right across the street (Rex Hotel and Rex Petit) that looked just as nice, but with smaller rooms and a smaller price. We would also have stayed at either of these.", "user": "Skye65", "date": "July 9, 2010", "id": 70245873}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "not bad - but quite far away from four stars!!!", "text": "Location of Hotel Hellsten is good. There are restaurants and shops along Sveavagen nearby the hotel. Hotel staff are polite and helpful with information. Service at breakfast was efficient. Although there were many guests when I stayed, the staff ensured that the tables are cleared quickly and that food is always available. Tea and coffee is available on self-service in the lounge. There are also two computers with internet connection and a connected printer (with printing paper). The single room I stayed in was a good size and had a soft and very comfortable 4-poster bed.
