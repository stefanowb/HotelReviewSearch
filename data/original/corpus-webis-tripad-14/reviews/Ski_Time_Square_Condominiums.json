The remaining building has been gently upgraded, but you need to know that each individual unit is privately owned, so your experience may vary. In our case, we were in a unit on the third flor that had been renovated somewhat piecemeal, but was just fine... Decent living room furnishings, a flat screen TV, a dining room set comfortable for four, and a small but functional kitchen. The kitchen was key to our experience, because it meant we could prepare a decent breakfast before we hit the slopes. Nothing fancy but everything we needed for casual meals. The refrigerator was struggling to keep up with freezing temperatures.. But again, privately owned units and I get the economics in play...

Well.. Yeah, hard to beat for the price, maybe anywhere in the West this season. Ski Time Square is a brisk but pleasant five minute walk from the gondola and Gondola Square... It is also nearly-ski-in, ski-out... If you walk out the uphill side and past the Kutuk building, then through the T-Bar parking lot, you can click in and ski down to the gondola quite easily, maybe 150 yards and a short, flat runout. Coming back, you angle right off of Vogue and down toward the old double chair (the trail section is called Headwall and it connects with the runout called Right-of-Way), then cut out at the T-Bar parking area to make your way home. Even better, rent from Steamboat Ski and Sport at Ski Time Square, and you can leave your gear at the Kutuk building and not hump it all the way back to the building. The staff are friendly and helpful and your boots spend the night on the boot dryer while you walk upstairs in your shoes.
