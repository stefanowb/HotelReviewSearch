Here's my experience from start to finish for those who are looking for a more robust description of it. As a bit of background, I am 31 yrs old, about 30 lbs overweight, but strong exercise-wise and my mom who is 59, average weight, and in fair exercise condition. I arrived at the Regency via taxi from FLL - airport taxi was around $38 at around 1pm. Upon arrival, I knew what to expect - a rather unappealing exterior surrounded by high rise condos. The interior is cozy - a lot of functional tile with a homey feel to it. Bruce introduced himself and asked me to have lunch while he got everything ready for my check-in. For a non-vegan (non-vegetarian!), lunch was a bit of a shock but very delicious. We had a gazpacho (just ok) and a salad bar with tons of healthy topping options. I had the tahini dressing and it is fabulous. I then checked in and Bruce gave me a folder, water bottle, visor, and a quick tour. My room was ready so I went to put my things away and start my program.", "title": "First Time Visitor - now a convert!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "NicoleandKyle", "date": "December 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 148232777}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled solo", "text": "We had an oceanview room and the view was spectacular. Very nice bathroom with glassed in shower area. Really, the resort just needs a bit of sprucing up, but everything was VERY CLEAN. Housekeeping does an excellent job. Bathrooms contained the typical amenities. The linens are like a Motel 6. If they would just upgrade the comforters, sheets, etc...it would be a HUGE improvement. But, so long as everything is clean, it wasn't the end of the world.

Morning walk first thing in the morning - you are dropped off at the boardwalk and it is a lot of fun to walk and be right next to the ocean. We went the first two days, but then decided to sleep in since we were doing the rest of the exercise classes. Breakfast is a set menu every day and I always had something different - oatmeal, the most amazing fresh fruit options, green juice smoothie (delicious!), and more.

He is a fascinating speaker and knows a lot about health. I know a lot about health and I continued to learn things while I was there. Then 11am usually has two aerobic classes - an AquaFit class and a class inside. The morning AquaFit class is in the ocean if the water is calm and warm and it was absolutely amazing. All the teachers were great. The classes with Debbie are a DO NOT MISS. Also, don't miss Alexandra's total body workout circuit - I think this is the Sunday class and it was the best class we took, hands down. Then, there is typically a class focusing on toning and shaping muscles. I was worried the classes weren't going to be hard enough, my mom was worried they were going to be too hard and the instructors did a terrific job modifying exercises and weights to give everyone a great workout. We were there at a quiet time, so got tons of personal hands-on instruction.", "title": "I love this place - it feels like a second home!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "KSG308", "date": "May 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129660697}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Hallandale Beach"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 3, "very good": 13, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 17}, "aka": "The Regency House Hotel Hallandale", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "The Regency Health Resort and Spa is an all-inclusive vegetarian health facility located right on the ocean.
