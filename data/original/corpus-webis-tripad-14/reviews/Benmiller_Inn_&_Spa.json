Leading up to our anniversary weekend visit to the Inn, I was unable to locate any detailed reviews for the establishment and went strictly on a couple recommendations from co-workers. This is the reason I post to your site today, to give a better understanding of the Inn and the individuals it best caters to.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "lovlos", "date": "April 17, 2006", "id": 4983426}], "location": {"country": "Canada"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 29, "average": 23, "very good": 53, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 60}, "aka": "Benmiller Inn And Spa", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
