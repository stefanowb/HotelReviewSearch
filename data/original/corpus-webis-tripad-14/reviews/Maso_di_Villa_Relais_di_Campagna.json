Every day our passion leads us to re-invent out relais, to create a true \u201chome away from home\u201d. At less than an hour from Venice with a view towards the foothills of the Alps, this great stone farmhouse stands all by itself on a hilltop in five hectares of woodland surrounded by vegetable gardens and vines.The property have been completely restored, rigorously respecting the original architecture dating back to the year 1800, using only period brick and stone. The SIX DOUBLE ROOMS \"WITH A VIEW\" have been individually and elegantly decorated in an original and warm style, to create a delicately pretty effect, and particular attention has been given to every detail, using only fabrics and materials of the highest quality to create a much sought after atmosphere. EACH ROOM HAS ITS OWN ATMOSPHERE: a particular colour, a custom-made wrought iron bed or a wooden floral motif headboard, refined bed-linen and a wonderful view make each living space worthy of a visit. Breakfasts are served under the pergola during the warmer months and in the country \u201cserra d\u2019inverno\u201d, with home-made jams and fruit from our big orchard, fresh squeezed fruit juice, fresh baked biscuits and pastries, coffee and tea, honey and cereals, eggs, ham and cheese, and other locally prepared products characteristic of the area."}
