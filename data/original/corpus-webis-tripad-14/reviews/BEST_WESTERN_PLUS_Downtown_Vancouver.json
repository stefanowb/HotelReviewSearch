Upon arrival we were upgraded to a penthouse suite by a lovely front of house manager. The staff were extremely helpful and the location of the hotel was wonderful, Granville St is full of character and I liked the way it wasn't super touristy. The street may be a tiny bit run down but I always felt very safe - even as a woman walking on my own late at night.

Although there have been several reviews that indicate that the area around the hotel is bad, we never felt unsafe. We did walk around the area in the evening and it was fine. You can easily avoid the bad areas listed by others. The hotel room was up to update and well kept. They actually had the best pillows of all the places we stayed for the following 2 weeks. Our room was on a higher floor and it had a view of the city and the tops of some mountains in the distance. The hotel offers a free shuttle drop off to the downtown area. You just call the front desk on the day that you need the shuttle to reserve a time. We used it the next morning to get to Canada Place where we boarded our cruise ship. The driver dropped us off directly where the cruise ship porters could immediately take our bags. Overall, this hotel was clean, comfortable, affordable for the downtown area. I would definitely stay there again.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "PlanoGuys", "date": "July 28, 2007", "id": 8247721}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Clean, modern, comfortable -- iffy neighborhood", "text": "I'm originally from Vancouver, and even now I come back once every 1-2 years for a break from work. Vancouver really does deserve its reputation as one of the best places on earth to live.

In many ways, that was an ideal place for us. Modern, clean rooms with every imaginable amenity for a couple or small family: fully equipped kitchen, laundry, spacious living rooms etc. It is perfectly appropriate to call it a home away from home if you're thinking about a week-long break (like we usually do). We particularly like their townhouse suites - which are outside the hotel 'proper' and even more like staying in your own home. It suits me more in that I feel more like a local Vancouverite and less like a tourist. The reason that we didn't stay there this time was because the Meridien does NOT have air conditioning. Yes, I know Vancouver is not known to be a warm city, but did anybody notice the temperatures here in early July this year rising to over 35 Celsius?! That's Global Warming for you all, folks. Sorry I'm not greener myself - but I do appreciate some air-con in this kind of weather.", "title": "Good location and base for sight seeing.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "PontypriddMick64", "date": "July 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8207388, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 The expensive charge for internet use in the lobby $4 for 20 mins!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "That's why we looked elsewhere.
