If you will stay to this hotel, I recommend to bring yor own towels. The hotel is a bit old and due for renovation and some roof cleaning. In addtion, avoid eating on thier restaurant during peak hours, it will take forever to have your food served. Overall, our experience in Yulia Inn is enjoyable. If you are on a budget and will still want to have a pleasant vacation, Yulia Inn Beach is well recommended.", "title": "No complaints. 5 mins walk to the Beach, Hard Rock, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts...Love it!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "krzysassy", "date": "October 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 45868058}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Room wise, there's nothing much to shout about. It's kinda \"A BUDGET\" hotel afterall. Stayed in room 811. Room is clean, sheets & bed very comfy. Though the towels are ok, but if you're particular, bring ur own. Pool is small but just nice to hang out with small group of friends after a day out at the beach surfing. But if you really need to SWIM, just go to Hard Rock and pay for the cabana at around $20 for the whole day.

DO NOT go for their standard room as they are very, very, very old and filthy. Deluxe or super deluxe onwards will do good because they are newer, cleaner and better amenities. Breakfast is simple. Location is good. Getting a taxi around this time of travel, Lebaran holidays, was a nightmare. I waited for at least 30 minutes to get one ! Terrible jam too. If you need a transfer to elsewhere, it's better to get the front desk to pre-book rather than hailing for one at the main road. For the price they charge for their deluxe rooms, it's better to seek elsewhere !
