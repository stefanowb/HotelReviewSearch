Across the road is the Graumann theatre and walk of fame, lots of places to see, lots of shops and restaurants. If you like buffets there is a new one across the road called Vegas Seafood Buffet. For just $20 you can dine on loads of fresh seafood and lots of other choices too. Most buffets leave a lot to be desired but this is a good one! Also loved the pharmacy there, you can buy your make up, get your prescription filled and buy booze and nibbles in one! The bars are really cool in the Roosevelt, dark and mysterious with amazing history. We really have nothing negative to say about this hotel, every staff member was courteous and friendly.
