The park is constantly refurbishing bungalows and ours was a 'pre-refurb' which was reflected in the price. It had all mod cons - good kitchen, lounge, bathroom facilities and even a parking space and patio (with furniture). Our only issue was that our bungalow was in a hollow surrounded by trees...no direct sunlight after 3pm each day.", "user": "katharineet", "date": "April 9, 2013", "id": 157241347}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "relaxing weekend in beautiful surroundings", "text": "The park itself is at the top of a hill and and is always kept clean and tidy.
