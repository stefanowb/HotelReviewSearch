The B&B is absolutely clean and fresh, the breakfasts are delicious & nutritious and it's conveniently situated. One of my favorite escapes was the Hawaiin style Lomi Lomi massage...The massage therapist was kind, welcoming and caring. I've received many massages and I have to say that the Lomi Lomi was an awesome experience. It incorporates the therapists forearms and elbows and the natural sounds of the waterfalls and birds singing right in the backyard gazebo! My husband and I really felt that Lucy and Terry cared for their guests...Lastly, I'd like to mention that we travelled to the other islands and stayed at many more B&B's, but we remember the Bamboo Jungle House as our favorite experience...Thanks Lucy and Terry!!!!", "title": "A Warm and Hospitable Place to Stay!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mbsb", "date": "August 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5543087}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Stay Here!
