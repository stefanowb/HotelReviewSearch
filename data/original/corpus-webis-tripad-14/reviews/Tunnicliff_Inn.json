There was a hot buffet breakfast in the morning that was VERY yummy! There is also a resturant in the basement of the Inn, which had a delicious dinner.

Unless you were playing marbles I cannot see where a slanted floor has anything to do with your stay. Granted the shower is quite small, but certainly something you can live with, unless you are planning to live in it for your stay. Location is about the best you can find in Cooperstown. I like the idea of parking my car and not needing it for a couple of days. Room was very comfortable and the staff is great - not very talkative but just the opposite can be quite a drag. Good selection at breakfast. As one person mentioned the stairs (outside and between floors) can be tough to navigate.

LOCATION: This hotel is essentially across the street from the Baseball Hall of Fame and a short walk from restaurants and shops, which makes it's location perfect...well sort of. It's close to everything, but because it's right in the commercial district, it doesn't have the quiet residential location of the Cooper Inn, the Inn at Cooperstown, or the Otesaga. PRICE: It doesn't have the quiet residential location of the Cooper Inn, the Inn at Cooperstown, or the Otesaga, but it doesn't have their pricetags either! The price was the best deal in town...simple as that. This is not a town with many real values, and if price is a main consideration for you, you should consider the Tunnicliff. ROOMS: How anyone can complain about slanted floors and narrow rickety staircases in a 19th century building is beyond me. However, there are some things lacking that should be within the control of management. Overall cleanliness was so-so. No bugs, no major problems, but the linens are not crisp and the carpets could be shampooed. SERVICE: There is rarely anyone at the front desk, but for us, once checked in, that was not a major problem. The attitude of the staff was not solicitous, but not rude either. There is private parking and a nice full breakfast served in a pleasant setting. SUMMARY: As I said, if location and price are your main considerations, the Tunnicliff is a good choice. You will not get the quiet, beautiful elegance of some of the other choices, but in a town of $300+ summer rates, $185 for a large King room with a full breakfast is a deal.", "title": "Not the best, not the worst - Location and price!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "steinwei", "date": "August 11, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 116558214}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011", "text": "Clean, quiet, perfect locale, and great breakfast!
