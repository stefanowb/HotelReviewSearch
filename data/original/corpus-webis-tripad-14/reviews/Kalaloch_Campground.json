We arrived early on a Friday. There were a lot of spots to choose from but ended up in A11. We opted for this one over a ocean front one because it was large and there were trees to hang my hammock up on. You could still hear the ocean and see it if you stood on the table. Seems as if the ocean front sites are made more for trailer campers vs tent campers. We spent most of our first day at the beach down the road called beach 2. We had the beach to ourselves. We ended up cutting our trip a day short due to the night and morning of torrential rains. On check out morning we were in the process of packing up our stuff and the camp hosts came by and reminded us the check out time was 11. It was 11:15 and there were only 12 other campers in the whole loop. I am sure that giving us an extra 45 minuets (really that\u2019s all it took) did not make any difference in the off chance someone wanted out spot for the night. Overall our stay was great and we will be back. If you are staying in late June you need to make a reservation.

There are paths that lead down to the beach which is strewn with fallen trees. Its an enjoyable stroll along the sand what ever the weather. We had sun, rain, wind and fog. The lodge has a store to buy groceries and a restaurant that has fab views if you are lucky enough to get a table by the picture windows. We asked for 1 when we booked for dinner earlier in the day.

I do recommend jumping online when the sites become available to assure a site with an ocean view; I unfortunately wasn't so lucky, but I still had a great time. The beach is just a rustic staircase away, and fires on the beach at night are permitted (but for some reason no one was down there at night which actually made it a better experience). The campground is centrally located so we were able to jump around to the Hoh, Ruby Beach (not as great as its made out to be), Rialto (hole in the wall) and the La Push beaches (first, second and third).

We traveled all over the west coast in July and camped from Nevada to Washington, and this was by far my favorite place. I had booked the site on the internet in March and wasn't really sure what to expect. The online description said \"waterview\", so we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to see that the site was directly across from the beach. Not only was there a great view, but we were also close to the bathroom and had a ton more privacy than those directly on the water. After scoping out other sites, we also learned that our site was really big!!! We have a small tent, but we seriously could've set up 3. The walk down to the beach from our site was less than 3 minutes. It was really just perfect!!! We will definitely be staying there again and hopefully at the same site.
