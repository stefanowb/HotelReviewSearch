Although some other reviewers have commented that finding this hotel can be difficult our sat-nav took us straight there. Check-in was smooth and the restaurant still open although the prices of food and drink reflect the captive market they have got and you do not go to a Novotel for gourmet cuisine. The room was standard Novotel - clean with a comfortable bed and perfectly good for a night or two. The hotel is obviously popular with Le Mans enthusiasts and assume there must have been a open day being held because I counted 12 other Porsches in the car park in addition to mine.", "title": "Perfectly good for an overnight stop", "user": "BigMac58", "date": "October 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 119429369}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled solo", "text": "thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Novotel Le Mans.", "title": "Novotel Le Mans", "user": "Gabrielmortimer", "date": "September 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118682625}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "our stay", "text": "From the moment of arrival, the ease of access from the motorway through pleasant residential areas, the friendly and helpful staff, the comfort and practicality of accommodation, to the excellent dining and choice of menus including abundant healthy choices, and the wonderful buffet breakfast, everything about Novotel is geared to the needs of the tired long-distance traveller.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 9, 2011", "id": 117867334}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "The usual high Novotel standard", "text": "And the biggest bonus is the secure parking and street level parking, ideal for a motorcyclist like myself.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 8, 2011", "id": 117827027}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "A reasonable hotel for a one night stop over.

Its very good value taking that all into account, its cheaper than other stopover Novotels presumably because its a bit out of town.

The hotel is on the outskirts of the town center however there is a tram stop right outside that gets you into the center (stop Republique) in about 10-15 minutes and runs every 10 minutes or so - it costs about 3 Euros for a return. (At the Republique stop there are many restaurants and bistros to choose from) Breakfast at the hotel was varied and plentiful and costs about 14 euros if not on your room rate (however nobody checks you in or out of the restaurant so if you are \"dishonest\" you could deny having breakfast when you leave.
