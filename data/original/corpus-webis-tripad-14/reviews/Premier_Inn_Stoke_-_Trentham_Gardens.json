The location of the hotel next to Trentham Gardens is interesting as there's a large, local shopping center, massive garden center with, at last count, three restaurants and a decent restaurant, Dave's.

It's located in what used to be Trentham Gardens, a modern building with ample car parking. They told me when I made my telephone booking that it was on the main road and there would be some traffic noise, but in fact there was just a faint hum. They also advised that the rooms had showers, not baths. It's sensible marketing to explain things in advance. Later I had to change my booking and I found their website excellent. It was an easy change, as I had kept my confirmation number, and the price for my new stay was lower, so I booked breakfast as well. Once inside the hotel, the decor has lots of the mauve associated with Premier Inns' advertising campaigns. Everything is on a tight budget, so you have to ring a bell to get a member of the reception staff. And you have to pay in advance, which to my mind is practical and sensible. It means the hotel is not afflicted by non-payers and you don't have to check out in the morning when you would rather be on your way than in a long queue. One of the lifts wasn't work and had a notice of apology on the door, but otherwise everything was smooth and efficient. My double bedroom was surprisingly large and well lit. There are no cupboards, just open shelving for cleanliness and efficiency. The first half hour of internet service is free, after which there's a \u00a33 charge. There's a kettle and tea or coffee, but no biscuits. The shower room is system designed and seems to be made of preformed plastic, but there's a good little bench in the shower for those who need it. Even the arrangements for soap are designed for cost-control and efficiency - liquid containers rather than little bars of soap and miniature shampoos and conditioners. As a business traveller, not wanting frills or unnecessary cost, this was all entirely up my street. And the double bed was extremely comfortable, with a fresh duvet and a signposted choice of firm and soft pillows, and a well positioned TV with remote control. Breakfast also exceeded expectations. It was all serve-yourself, including the beverages, but the hot buffet was attended by willing servers who ensured that the bains-marie were reguloarly replenished with fried eggs, bacon, sausage, grilled tomatos, plum tomatos, baked beans, mushrooms and hash brown potatoes. In short, this was a very good hotel for the traveller in a hurry who wants 21st-century efficiency, with a good level of comfort at an attractive price.", "title": "Good value.", "user": "travelmore67", "date": "November 7, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144819877}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled on business", "text": "We couldn't get into the PI we wanted near Stafford so decided to book into Trentham.
