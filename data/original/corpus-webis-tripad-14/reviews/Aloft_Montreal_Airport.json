Whenever I am visiting big cities with a rental car I book hotels near or at the airport because the rates, convenience and ample parking (and I am also an airline 'enthusiast'). Without traffic (even though this is a rare occurance) Its only a 20 minute drive to downtown Montr\u00e9al. When we stepped in the lobby after a long drive from Rochester NY we felt like we just walked into 'Chalum's Cantina' (fictional Bar in Star Wars Movies) on the Planet 'Tatooine', expecting to see Aliens from the entire Universe sitting around the Lava Lamps sipping Out-of-this-world-cocktails. The d\u00e9cor, the music (not too loud \u2013 just perfect) and the lighting created the perfect urban, hip Disco/Dance/Chill atmosphere. You feel relaxed almost immediately. I was never surprised by any Hotel Lobby in such a way. Check-in was smooth, relaxed and in 2 minutes we had the key-cards to our 2 rooms on the 4th floor. I cannot go too much into details about this hotel, otherwise this review would be several pages long. The room was, especially the setup, was very unusual and quite smart as well. There is almost nothing to complain about this hotel, even though I always find something. It is by far the most interesting 3-star Airport Hotel I have ever stayed at \u2013 right down to the smallest details!
