Like most of Italy, you have to be prepared for steep climbs and lots of steps (in the village, not the hotel), but our three days in Volterra at the Villa Porta all'Arco were a great experience. The hotel is in an old villa just outside the old walled village. The short walk into town is very steep and on a busy road with a minimal shoulder so you have to be careful. The room was extremely clean and comfortable and the breakfast in the back yard was excellent. The parking lot is tight but was fine during our visit. My family took an all-day tour with Annie Adair of Tuscan Tours and it was the highlight of our two week trip. Volterra has great restaurants and a wonderful ambience. If you don't mind the walk, the Villa Porta all'Arco is a fine hotel that provides an excellent value for the dollar.", "user": "sfa59", "date": "June 17, 2007", "id": 7867358}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely Hotel in a great town", "text": "We had a very pleasant stay at the Villa Porta all'Arco. We found the host Antonella to be extremely friendly, helpful and very proud of her hotel and Volterra. We had a downstairs room overlooking the garden and outside the breakfast area which could be noisy of a morning although this was not a problem for us. It was decorated in a traditional Tuscan style and scrupiously clean.", "user": "yorks_nameless", "date": "October 31, 2006", "id": 6034153}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "A romantic 3 week wedding in Italy and this was the worst night", "text": "The hotel itself is located a short walk from the Porta all arco itself but this is reached with a 100m walk along the busy road which could be dangerous with some of the driving that you see in italy.

Breakfast was a delightful experience. The accommodations are simple, but clean and utilitarian, and well worth the reasonable rates charged. Two words of caution. (1)The hotel is on a busy street that must be walked along and traversed to climb the several steps to the town. It is not recommended for those with any walking limitations, unless you plan to use a car to go up and down to the town.
