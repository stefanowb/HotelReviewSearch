This hotel is definitely not used to having families stay there. I stayed with my wife, a toddler and a dog, and we received sneers and rude treatment from the day we checked in. They weren't very understanding of my wife having to take care of a dog and baby while I was attending a conference in Stuttgart. If your a single businessman, I sure this hotel would be okay, since that's all I saw stay there. I guess they didn't like our t-shirts and jeans when everyone else was in suits and ties.
