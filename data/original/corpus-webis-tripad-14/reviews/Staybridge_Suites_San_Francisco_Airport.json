I have to say that the Staff and Management there could put on a clinic for other hotels on how to treat their customers. They were fabulous. Every encounter was greeted with a smile and a \"can-do\" attitude. Whether it was an extra towel, room upgrade, taxi to the airport, or taking out a bag of food for our wait at the airport....nothing was too much to ask. I cant say enough about how accommodating the Staff was. Yes it is about a 20 minute drive to downtown San Francisco, but the BART train station is a 2 minute walk from the hotel if you don't want to drive. As far as value goes, we got a great deal on a 2 bedroom unit with full kitchen...plenty of room for 4 people. Free breakfast every morning was good, and they also have free snacks and wine/beer every Tues-Thurs from around 5pm for a couple hours. Would highly recommend this place as a \"home base\" for San Fran sightseeing. Only negatives is that the \"curb appeal\" is not great (who cares, really) and that being so close to the airport you can hear the planes taking off early in the morning on occasion.", "title": "Great Place to Stay while Visiting San Francisco", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "J-Roc123", "date": "August 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 116402836}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here to have more room at a lower price.

I stayed at the Staybridge Suites for over 2 weeks from end of August through mid-September, half business and half personal. It was perfect for my needs in every way and Lisa, the GM, runs an amazing operation. Her staff know the guests and are constantly trying to help (but not in an intrusive manner). The hotel's location is just fine - very nearby SFO (I had business in Foster City so was back and forth often - easy commute) and there is a great jogging trail behind the hotel (Centenial Way (?) I think it's called). Although I had a rental car, I found it easy and plesant to walk across the street to the strip mall where there is a massive grocery store, Starbucks, nail salons, Best Buy, you name it.
