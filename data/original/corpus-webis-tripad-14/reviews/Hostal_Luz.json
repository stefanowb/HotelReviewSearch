Hostal Luz couldn't have been more convenient for our purposes. The double room was clean and friendly with a nice shower room as well as impeccably working wifi. We were also much impressed with the three computers put at the guests disposal and made ample use of them to plan our daily sightseeing, shopping and entertainment. Margarita at the reception was very helpful and the whole hostal felt completely safe. The only negative issue was that Saturday night was marked by full blast music until the early hours (from somewhere up or down the street). As all the other nights were perfectly calm, this might have been an exception, or maybe one should just spend Satuday nights out partying like the locals. Anyhow, this wasn't a great problem (people having fun - hey, it's Madrid) and I warmly recommend the hostal to anyone.", "title": "Excellent location, clean and safe", "user": "asmile", "date": "October 26, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 119750997}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "PS: I don't think that the statement made in an earlier review that taxis are not allowed near the hostal is correct.
