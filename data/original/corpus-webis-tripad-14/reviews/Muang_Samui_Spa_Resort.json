The location was perfect IF you want to be on Chaweng Beach- it sits at the north end of the \"strip\" so you are close, and can walk everywhere on Chaweng, but never felt trapped in the middle of it all. In fact, when on the property itself, one forgets that the main street of Chaweng Beach is there at all. The breakfast buffet every morning was terrific, with so many choices I don't see how anyone could get tired of it or complain- everything was fresh and delicious.
