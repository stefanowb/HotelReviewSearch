This entitled me to a good price and a \"room gift\". At reservation I had given them my EB-number, as did I do at check in. I did not recieve any room gift, nor did the points make it to my account. As to the hotel, the room was ok. Breakfast was terrible however, this could have something to do with the hotel being rather empty (just before christmas 2004). At breakfast we were only served a very limited assortment, I've seen better even at 2* hotels.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Gnopps", "date": "February 16, 2005", "id": 3195383}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Use as last choice or if $$ is extremely limited", "text": "Don't expect anything special from this hotel.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 30, 2004", "id": 2240992}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "We stayed here 2 nights and were very disappointed. Quality it is not, consider it a 2 star hotel. One + was that you needed a room card to get on elevators to rooms, however the - was that the room card does not open the \"exercise\" room. Rooms were dirty and beds uncomforable. The shower was the highlight of the room. Service was almost average but quite reserved. A very limited menu is offered on the weekends, and there are no other local hotels in the immediate area in which to eat at. Another plus was the shuttle, which likely is the only thing keeping the hotel in business. I'd suggest that one seriously consider staying at the airport Radison hotel, even if the cost is a stretch, you'll be glad you did.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Cocheese79", "date": "August 23, 2003", "id": 1257044}], "location": {"country": "Sweden", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 31, "average": 26, "very good": 21, "terrible": 8, "excellent": 9}, "aka": "Park Inn By Radisson Stockholm-Arlanda Hotel", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
