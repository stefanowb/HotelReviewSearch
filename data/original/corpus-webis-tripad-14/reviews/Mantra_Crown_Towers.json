If it were not for the pool, it would have nothing! The renovated rooms you see on the website do not exist, yet anyway. The room you do stay in is tired and unclean with stained carpet and a bad smell. This is the 2nd time I have stayed here because I looked at the website an saw MANTRA had taken over an the rooms and that it had been renovated. Renovation has not taken place, nothing has changed since my last stay 3 years ago. Reception staff are unfriendly and give u barely any information at all at check in. The property has an amazing Thai restaurant and day spa and all day cafe, so u think they would promote this and give u information about opening hours, menu etc. There is nothing in your room, like a welcome book with hotel information etc nothing to make u feel welcome. After bringing this to the managers attention and getting nothing but being made to feel like an idiot, From previous experience the first thing I did was air the appartment out, and wipe everything down with my own spray an wipe disinfectant. They give u one sachets of washing liquid so I can understand why all the dishes needed cleaning before use as people would not go and buy their own. House keeping must have forgot to turn the dishwasher on whilst cleaning as we walked into our room with a load of other people's dishes packed in the dishwasher that were unwashed. Then I had to clean the dishwasher filter myself as it was clogged with food. I went to vacuum the dirty carpet to find the vacuum had no bag in it??? There is no dust pan an brush and the broom was broken. Mop pad is ripped an barely useable. The balcony was filthy, with the plastic sun bed needing a good scrub. Not to mention the cigarette butts littered everywhere an a homemade \"bong\" stuffed behind the air con. Just not good enough. After I cleaned everything and told myself just to get over it, we had a really good time. But I can understand why the rooms are as they are because if they do not provide guests with sufficient cleaning utensils etc how are they meant to keep their room clean during their stay, as daily house keeping does not exist.
