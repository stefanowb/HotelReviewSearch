We tipped our maid very well and, every day, because she worked hard. The room was large, but it was shabby. We have stayed at hundreds of hotels in Europe for 1/3 the price of this hotel and we were welcomed with open-arms and made to feel like family. Not this hotel!

The rooms were lovely and overlooked the Pantheon and Piazza. Walls are upholstered in padded silk (?) and the rooms were quiet and clean. The lobby and breakfast room were also sparkling and well decorated. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful and recommended great restaurants at different price points. They are true professionals with warmth. We observed an interesting mix of travelers in the breakfast room - there were tourists from a variety of countries (US, Europe and Asia) as well as business people. This, to us, was another sign that this is a true Italian albergo, not a tourist trap.", "title": "Very pleased", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Excellentadventures2", "date": "July 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5478599}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "I stayed at this lovely hotel for 3 nights and while it lacked the flash and glamour of some other hotels I stayed in during my trip to Italy, I must say that I cannot find anything to complain about at all. The rooms are spacious by European standards (call ahead to request a room on an upper floor overlooking the Pantheon. The view is wonderful--the Pantheon, the square, even the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the distance.), the bathroom was modern and the location is perfect for exploring the entire city. There are several wonderful sidewalk cafes to sit at and just pass some very pleasant time people watching. The concierge is very pleasant and helpful. Be sure to have him arrange for transportation to the hotel from the airport. Do not even think about driving--the streets we took to the hotel were more like alleyways and I could not have found my way there if my life depended on it, Also, if you plan to visit the Vatican, have them arrange a private tour guide. You can easily navigate Vatican City on your own but there is a special entrance for guides that is open from 8-8:45 a.m. We waited in line for 30 minutes in the shade while those in the general admission line waited for about 3 hours in full sun,", "title": "Outstanding Hotel and Location", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Rosenfelder", "date": "July 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5459782}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "As for restaurants, the concierge happily made my reservations--I can highly recommend Dal Bolognese and Da Fortunato which is less than 1 minute from the hotel on foot.", "title": "Great Place", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "stephensmom", "date": "July 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5444662}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lazio", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Rome"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 25, "average": 53, "very good": 286, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 1593}, "aka": "Albergo Del Senato Hotel Rome", "slim_ranking": 0.00236593059937, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}}
