We arrived on Friday evening at ~ 6 PM and I was immediately struck by how small the doors of the entrance were - it was somewhat difficult to easily navigate rolling baggage into the doors, especially with other folks leaving the hotel simultaneously. The lobby is grand and elegant and unique. It is one of those special places that one needs to see in person and written descriptions do not do it justice. Despite the fact that we arrived in the evening, our room was not yet ready and we had to wait about an hour. The room itself was small and ordinary with minimal amenities. The king size bed was comfortable but my sleep was often interrupted by the many trains that pass through Nashville during the night and early hours of the morning - I would strongly recommend not staying on the west side of the hotel. I arose early to exercise - the fitness room is on the seventh floor - and was quite disappointed in the facility. There were about 7-8 aerobic type machines and some free weights and very very limited space. Very little effort has been given to having a first rate exercise facility. My wife and I left to spend the day with our daughter (it was family weekend at Vanderbilt) and returned to the hotel at about 6 PM to find our room as we left it - housekeeping had not bothered to show up. We notified the front desk and they were left for dinner and when we returned later the room had finally been cleaned.

Worse, our room was connected to some kind of conference room, so we had to eavesdrop over some company's stupid meeting whether we wanted to or not. Irritating. The bed, however, was GREAT! Lots of pillows, which is a bonus because some hotels get really stingy with the pillows. The bathroom was nicely decorated and of normal size, nothing huge but not puny either. Cool marble sink.
