My husband and I stayed for 4 nights in early May and our experience was exactly what we were looking for in a vacation. As previous reviewers have noted, the location is excellent. It's very convenient to the liveliness of San Marco while being quiet and removed at the same; it truly was an \"oasis\" after our long walks through the streets and alleys of Venice. Our superior room was large, comfortable, and perfect for our needs. Fabio made us feel so welcome and was very accommodating in helping us find restaurants that matched our interests. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. We cannot recommend the 3C highly enough to others looking for the ideal place to stay in Venice.
