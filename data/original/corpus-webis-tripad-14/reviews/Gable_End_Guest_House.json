The main advantage is that the price for your room includes transport to and from Gatwick. So you can park your car, check into your room, have a wander around Horley, eat at Ye Old Six Bells Inn, have a good night's sleep and then be taken to Gatwick. On your return, they will collect you and off you go. We landed at Gatwick at 8 am, had a mere 5 minute wait before Joseph picked us up and as we hadn't had time for breakfast when we left, offered to cook us one before we left to come home. Absolutely brilliant customer service, all with cheery smiles and typical Irish hospitality. We will definitely return if we fly out of Gatwick again on an early flight.
