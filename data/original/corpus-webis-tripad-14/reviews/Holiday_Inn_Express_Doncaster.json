The hotel is near the industrial estate and not far off the motorway and outlet shops. The check in was very quick and the staff were polite and friendly. The hotel looks fairly new and has a big car park. The rooms were big with good sized bathrooms and amenities and very comfortable. There was free internet access in the reception area. The rooms were very quiet with virtually no noise overnight. Breakfast was very good with a selection of both hot and cold food. Quick check out - no complaints at all and would recommend for anyone visiting the area. The restaurant/pub across the car park from the hotel had excellent meals and would recommend this as well.", "title": "Great place to stay in Doncaster", "user": "KSTravellers", "date": "August 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 75109243}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Stayed for 1 night with young family travelling on holiday to Scotland.

(Great Car boot on Sundays!). When I walked in I had the impression that the hotel had only just opened it was so fresh and clean. Was shocked it had been open 3 years. Congratulations to staff. Great Reception, room was great, bedding superb. One very small complaint, during the night without your glasses it is impossible to read the time on the TV digital clock. Something nearer the beds would be good. New 'hot' breakfast good, 2 items sausages and beans, but plenty on the 'cold' side. Altogether a nice hotel. Would have been nice if Wi Fi had been included. Some HIE include others don't so just pot luck I suppose. I would recomend this hotel.
