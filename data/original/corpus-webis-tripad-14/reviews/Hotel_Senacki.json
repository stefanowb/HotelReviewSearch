The street is a little busy during the day with pedestrians but there is not much traffic. The hotel also has very effective double glazing. The hotel itself is fairly small but has two restaurants, one in the basement (lift available) which is also used for breakfast and one near the entrance.

Our visit to Krakow began with us arriving very late to the Hotel Senacki. We were greeted by a very relieved staff member (Sylwia) who had been expecting us. She really made us feel at home. She gave us maps, information on trips we could take and even restaurant recommendations. The airline had lost our luggage so the staff at Hotel Senacki made numerous calls on our behalf trying to get any information they could about where the bags were and when we could expect them.

We were facing the main street and did not find it too loud at all, even slept with the window open (and I am a very light sleeper). The room was spotless and comfortable. Breakfast was awesome! There was great selection in the buffet: sausages, yogurt, cereals, cheese, meat, breads, eggs, etc. You can also order something made fresh from the menus on the table. I HIGHLY recommend having the nalesniki z serem (crepes with sweetened cream), I didn't come across better nalesniki anywhere else in Poland (we travelled all over for 2 weeks)!
