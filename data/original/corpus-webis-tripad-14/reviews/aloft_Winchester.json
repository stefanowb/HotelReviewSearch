The rooms aren't large, but the layout is smart with modern styling. The blackout curtains are the best I've ever seen (as an RN who is usually switching between schedules this is an important variable to catching up on sleep). There is an HDMI input jack if you want to hook your laptop up to the giant flat screen (boyfriend loved this) for movie watching or using the free WIFI on the big screen. The bed was comfortable with good linens. Best of all, the place is pet friendly and has grass out front for your pooch! With multiple entrances every parking space (and there were plenty) were close. We didn't take advantage of the fitness center, but it had everything needed for a good workout with plenty of cardio and resistance machines as well as free-weights. The indoor pool is small, and frequently overrun with squealing children (but that's to be expected I suppose). As mentioned in other reviews, the bath products are good quality and dispensed in permanent fixtures rather than single use bottles. The only negative thing was when the staff lost our trip-extension information during shift change and we had to check-in twice when the housekeeper woke me up during a nap telling me to go downstairs and make a new reservation.

No issues with cleanliness of the hotel and the room but the shower is horrible. The paper cup and tiny pencil are bush league. Bed wasn't very comfortable and you can't open a window and get fresh air. Great TV with many inputs. Electrical outlets are hard to find and you'd expect more in a newer place. Also the dark brown color is hard to find in the dark. These deficiencies are common to the Aloft brand but after enough feedback you'd think Starwood would get off its corporate hiney and make a few improvements. Trendy should not equate to chintzy. Staff was OK. This review makes the place sound worse than it really is but as a newer brand the issues should not be there. A bit noisy walls.
