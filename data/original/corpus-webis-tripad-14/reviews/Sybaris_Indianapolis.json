Once we arrived at our mini apartment (each room is a seperate building apartment ) We walked into our room and were absoluley amazed. The room was gorgeous, and truly the most romantic I had ever been to. There were no windows in the rooms, so it was exclusive to you and your significant other.

Very, very clean. I was somewhat worried about that before arriving. The outside grounds, and the neighborhood can be misleading. It sits in an industrial part of the city. But we obviously didnt go to Sybaris for the grounds. Once inside, we were really in our own world. Lots of fun stuff - swimming, steam room was very cool, jacuzzi was relaxing. Nice to bring our own food - there was microwave and fridge. And i cant say enough about the bed. It is cheesy, but fun. Not exactly romantic in the bed and breakfast type of way. But more in a wild way. Mirrors on ceiling, pretty lighting on bed, fake stars, fireplace, led to ambiance. Very nice massage chairs with rolling and kneading. Great sound system - fun for dancing in the pool area! Would go back a lot, but is somewhat pricey. Absolutely worth it though, and is about a 2 hour drive from home.
