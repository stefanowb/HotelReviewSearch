The property is beautifully located and well-maintained. The lawn overlooks the lovely Nigeen Lake and there is even a little jetty for shikaras to pick up guests from straight off the lawns. The rooms were comfortable, though a little warm (thankfully, ACs were installed), and we slept well. There is running hot water, though it takes at least 5-10 minutes for the boilers to deliver hot water to the taps. Food was excellent and the staff are eager to help, even if they are a little inexperienced. The owner, Khurram, is pretty accessible and very helpful.

Coffee comes from a proper coffee machine instead of the usual \"instant\" varieties.
