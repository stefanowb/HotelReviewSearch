We had a quiet room on the third floor that overlooked the inner courtyard; in previous stays, my companion has had rooms on the outside overlooking Blanshard and Courtenay streets, which are somewhat subject to traffic noise and noise from passers-by. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Like many older properties, soundproofing from the hall wasn't great - we heard footfalls and conversation quite clearly - but luckily the other residents were relatively quiet throughout our stay. Would definitely stay here again.", "user": "alphabetkid", "date": "August 28, 2012", "id": 138732280}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice Room for the $$$", "text": "My husband, son and I were in town for the annual dragonboat festival the weekend of 8/17/12-8/19/12. We were able to reserve a room several months in advance, for much less than the hotel the festival recommended. The room was nice enough, with a flat panel tv and a mini refrigerator. Plenty of lamps and even complimentary bathrobes for our stay. One downside, no A/C, though they did provide a table-top fan, which we needed the first night as it was pretty warm. The hotel was easy walking distance to the harbor, shops and restaurants. Great courtyard with fountain, deck and tables provided a perfect meeting place for other people we were traveling with. The breakfast at the Argyle Attic (attached restaurant/bar) was nice and in line price-wise with other comparable restaurants nearby. Some road noise and shouting from people out and about on Friday evening, but not too bad. Overall, I would stay here again!", "user": "Andrea H", "date": "August 25, 2012", "id": 138356271}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "A great little hotel plus service with a smile", "text": "Although this is a small hotel we found it to be really suitable for what we needed. It has a great location within walking distance of harbour, attractions and shops. Our room obviously wasn't newly decorated but it had everything we needed including a fridge and a large flat-screen tv. Particularly liked the alarm clock/iphone dock - very useful for charging the phone each evening! We used the laundry, pool and \"fitness\" room all of which were just what we needed, nothing more nothing less. We also used the restaurant - The Argyle Attic - which provided a good value range of breakfasts and very good service. Most of all it was the great service we enjoyed - thanks to the helpfulness of the service from all the staff (Samantha, Donna and Glenn and Gary - I remembered guys!). Yes, there is only one lift, but it is not a huge hotel and I can see this is a something which is not easy to change. We had a great stay and I would definitely recommend this and stay again.
