The suite was huge and beautifully furnished. Housekeeping gave a light tidy everyday (dressed beds/loaded dishwasher etc.) with a big clean being completed on the 5th day. The resort has 3 huge swimming pools and the newest one has a waterslide and pirate themed kiddie area, although it was too cold to fully appreciate in Feb. The hot tub, however, was amazing - too hot if anything! There's one restaurant in the resort and it really wasn't great, not exactly a fine dining experience! You will definitely need a car if staying here as it is at the quieter end of I-Drive. The trolley stops right outside but crossing the road, particularly with children can be dangerous as it's 6 lane with no pedestrian crossing. The road is pretty quiet outside of rush hour. One negative point - beware of staff trying to sell time-share apartments! When we arrived they told us about all these free gifts and Disney discounts we'd get at a complimentary breakfast the next day. However, we read the detail to discover it was an invitation to a 90 minute talk re time-share!!! 90 minutes mightn't sound like much to get really good discounts, but it would have taken up the entire 1st morning as it began at 8am.

We were exhausted everyday from Disney so to come back to this hotel was lovely. The food at the hotel was well cooked, not much choice but value for money. The hotel pool outside our hotel room was cold!!! but didn't stop my daughter going in. The main pool was lovely and warm though so I did venture in there.

The other let down was there was only one small expensive cafe for the whole of the complex and one small shop but the publix supermarket is 2minute drive.To stay here I would definatley recommend a car as it is at the bottom of international drive and nowhere is in walking distance ,but the location is ideal for disney and interntional drive.They do want you to go to the owners meeting but you dont have too,we went and got $75 and half price park tickets which was worth a couple of hours of head pecking at the end you just say no thanks and walk away.

The property is gorgeous!! They put me in Building 17 at the very back of the property. I was very pleased with my room. It was so quiet and I never heard another person the whole time I was there. Very nicely decorated and I loved the little kitchen it had. There was a small problem with the shower liner. When I walk into the room I could smell a strong odor of mold/mildew and I knew it was probably coming from the showe liner. When I pulled the shower curtain back, Good Golly Miss Molly, there was several large spots of mold on the liner. The next morning, when I left for the day, I showed the girl at the front desk the photos I took of the liner and explained that it really needed to be changed. Now, my room did not come with maid service with the price I received, but they came in and did a VIP cleaing (at no charge) and changed the liner. I would not let this incident discourage anyone from staying at this great property. I would highly recommend these condos and it would be a great place for families that stay for a week or two at a time. It is about a 10-15 minute drive to Universal Studios and for all the those who like to shop at high-end outlet stores, there is a Premium outlet store 2 minutes from this property and the Prime Outlet is a 5 minute drive from Universal Studios. This is a great place and I would definitely stay here again when I come back to Orlando.
