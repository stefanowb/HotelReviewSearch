The pool is TOPLESS!!!!!!! I could understand the beach being topless but not the pool. I had two 12 year old girls that were upset. The reviews all indicated a family resort. I do not think topless at the main pool is very family- friendly. The pool closed at 6:00, which was a bummer. The El Pueblito staff was very friendly. The only person we had a problem with was Marcela, who was suppose to be helping us with some bus routes but ending up setting us help for a \"not a timeshare\" meeting. She kept hounding us when we didn't show up. The entertainment staff could get a little nasty for younger kids. The food was average. The nightly shows were excellent. The rooms were just something you would go to sleep in and not hang out in. If I did not have children to bring to the resort, I might would stay here again.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 17, 2004", "id": 2752989}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Had a fantastic stay at the El Pueblito", "text": "I have just returned from the El Pueblito and had one of the best holidays ever. I agree with some of the other reviews that the food choice was not great but this is the 5th time I have gone All Inclusive, having been to the Dominican Repulic, Cuba and previously to a different area of Mexico and it wasn't much different to any of these. The hotel was the cleanest I have ever stayed in, you see people cleaing throughout the day, and the staff were the friendliest. They weren't all just after tips, we didn't tip until our last day and the service didn't change from the staff just because they didn't get a tip each night. They couldn't do enough for you and you rarely had to wait more than a minute or two to get a drink, in fact one usually arrive before you had to ask for it. The entertainment staff were brilliant and the shows really good. I would definitely recommend the El Pueblito and disagree that this is an '18-30' hotel, there were people ranging from babies to those in their 60's when I stayed there and they all received the same service from the staff.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Ceels11", "date": "October 17, 2004", "id": 2752926}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Absolutely Fantastic", "text": "El Pueblito, Cancun was the best hotel we have stayed in.

My room #3211 was a nice and cute room, a/c worked so good, hot water, and t.v worked good too. The food was ok,, and the titanic drinks were awsome. The actual resort was a mexican atmosphere that i really loved the most, i wanted to feel the mexican feeling, and it was wonderful. The best part was meeting a few friends, and having the time of my life. I would reccomend this resort to anyone who want a mexican village style, great service, friendly staff, and the most amazing time ever.

All we did was sleep, eat and shower there we were gone every day on tours. The beach in front of the hotel was absolutely amazing. The staff was very nice. One guy in particular was the guy at the tours desk in the hotel. I can't remember his name but we were so impressed we tipped him $25us before we left. He was a tremendous help in booking tours and went out of his way to help us. The food was not the greatest but it was alright. Sometimes we didn't eat there anyways if we were gone all day. Cancun is worth every last penny. I went swimming with the dolphins at isla mujueres it was amazing. I will never forget that experience!!!! I am going back to cancun January 23 2005 and will be staying at the royal park pyramids hopefully it's nice there.
