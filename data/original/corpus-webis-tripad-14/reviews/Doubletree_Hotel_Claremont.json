You can easily get a decent price on a hotels web site (approx. $100 a night, sometimes!), and the hotel is clean and easily accessible. I've never eaten at the restaurant or bar, but you don't have to, because Claremont has a wonderful variety of establishments within walking distance. The sliding door on the bathroom is a little weird, but livable; also, the coffeemaker didn't exactly produce great brew, but there's a little coffee and smoothie bar (The Spot) around the corner that is highly recommended. Couple that with the fact that Trader Joe's is right next door, and you're set for food in a hurry. The room has a fridge, so it's easy to grab a couple of salads and sodas and settle in for work or relaxation if you wish.

The bed was very comfortable and had plenty of pillows! There was a small balcony which I couldn't enjoy due to the rain that was coming down. The bathroom door had a large opaque glass inset so if you were sharing a room it left some privacy but not as much as if it had been a solid door. The bathroom itself was nice but there was no where to hang any clothes. The only place to hang anything was right at the edge of the shower.
