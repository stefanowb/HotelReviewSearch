The hotel was very clean, and the front desk staff was nice and helpful. The room was typical Hampton Inn room that I'm used to. Clean room, free internet access, free breakfast, and for being close to the airport, it was fairly quiet. I guess Shreveport airport isn't all that busy. The only concern with this place is that it didn't look like a very safe location, at least not safe enough for a woman to go for a run during the day.

The bathroom was average. Mostly clean, good toiletries, adequate shower. The workdesk was quite nice, rounded and with lots of room to set up my computers and equipment. The breakfast bar was also average Hampton Inn fare. Well tended by the friendly lone breakfast hostess. One evening we asked for directions to an area with a selection of restaurants. The directions given to us took us almost 1/2 hour, and took us through some undesirable areas. Later, upon inspecting a map, we saw that there was a quite more direct route using the interstate, but the clerk seemed a bit confused and/or 'out-of-touch'. Perhaps he did not live in Shreveport.

I had to walk around an industrial area that I was unfamiliar with. The staff offered no real solutions. Buy a new treadmill. I could not use the high speed internet at all.
