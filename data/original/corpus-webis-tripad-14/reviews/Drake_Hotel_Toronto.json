I rang down at 3.20am to find out how much longer it would last (and informed it'd only be another 20 minutes or so - I'm guessing the 'or so' meant 'add another hour on to that) and request ear plugs, only to be told that they had no earplugs, that there wasn't anything they could do and not actually hear the word 'sorry'. Had we have had some warning or an apology, we'd probably have been fine about it, but with none forthcoming, it was a hardly an auspicious start to our stay.
