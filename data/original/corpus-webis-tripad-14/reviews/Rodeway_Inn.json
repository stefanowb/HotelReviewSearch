The staff is very professional and polite. The \"lodge\" facilities are very warm and comfortable, with evening snacks and of course breakfast. One evening I was there, a \"major\" game of some sort was playing on a large flatscreen TV. Quite a group of people were lounging on over-comfortable furniture, eating snacks and having a great time.! Nice to be part of, when away from friends and family. The rooms are large and comfortable with great beds! The bathrooms are small but functional and each one I've been in has had a large jacuzzi tub/shower. Refrigerator/coffee maker included.

It didn't feel safe to me, and for the price or even a bit more, there are many other options in the area. The motel's website has pictures of the rooms and they appear to be decent. One reviewer even stated that the rooms were better than they appeared on the website. This is false. Our room was dingy and the bed was horrible. It also didn't feel/look clean. The whirlpool tub also serves as the shower, and was located in the main room as opposed to the bathroom. Maybe in another setting this could be considered romantic, but not when the tub is inserted in the wall and located behind a sliding shower door.

OK. When we checked in, the receptionist at the front desk told us that the rates were different (and much higher) than those I had reserved on their website. When I produced the printed reservation he backed down and said that he would honor the original rates we received. He was very polite, but hostile. He also made a point of telling me that he was doing us a favor and upgrading us to rooms with king sized beds. I didn't bother to tell him that the original reservation already promised that. When we checked out, the attitude was the same from another staff member who charged us about $25.00 more than agreed upon in the original reservation.
