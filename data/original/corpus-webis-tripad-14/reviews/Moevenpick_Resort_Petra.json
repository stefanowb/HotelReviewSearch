After a long and tiring walk through the fantastic city, to be so near to your room and to the hotel facilities is really a pleasure. The hotel is comfortable and clean. Rooms are spacious, we have been pleasantly upgraded to a suite, well equipped with cooking, espresso machine and tea boiler. Good quality and variety of buffet at dinner as well as at breakfast time. Hotel is always crowded by every sort of tourists, not always properly behaving, in dress and attitudes. You can easily perceived that the hotel is used only as a basis for Petra visit, for one or two nights maximum stay: this affects the behavior of staff, especially waiters, a little rude, scarcely ready to fulfill customers needs, conscious that in any case new guests will come the day after. As a recommendation , a dress code should be asked for: it is not acceptable for a 5 stars hotel to admit guests at dinner time with bathroom slippers!", "title": "Petra with Swiss attention to detail", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "forthwrite", "date": "October 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180529718}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with family", "text": "If you want 5-star accommodations and service, Movenpick Petra will not disappoint.
