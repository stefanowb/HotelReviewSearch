We had much higher expectations judging from the website and reviews. I asked for another room and was told I would be happy in the room we were in, I wasn't. We would have paid more for a better room but were told this was the only one available, even though it was obvious the property was not even close to full. The property seems neglected with standing water, ashtrays filled with the same gum balls and used bandaids by the pool for days, leaves and debris in the paths. Our room was dark, the partial ocean view was available if you stood on porch and leaned out. The porch was separated from the road by a thin line of trees and it was very loud with buses, trucks & cars all day and all night. We had hoped to hear birds in the early morning like everywhere else we stayed in Costa Rica, instead we heard traffic and a generator that was also pretty darn loud. We ran the air conditioner in the room at night to drown out the noise so we could get some sleep. It was a window unit and also pretty loud. There was a giant TV in the room that we didn't use. The bed seemed to have sand in it no matter what we did. One day we asked to have the room cleaned when we went out, we came back 2 hours later and it still wasn't cleaned. We called again and still 2 more hours and it wasn't cleaned. We had wanted to take a nap but by the time our room was cleaned it was too late in the day.", "title": "Wish we'd stayed elsewhere", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "BrooklynMaMa", "date": "April 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 29054176}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "There is a lot of walking on this property and it's all very spread out.

We had a room in the B building with a spectacular view of Manuel Antonio and the ocean. The room was decorated Costa Rican beach style and very nice (certainly not on par with luxury hotels by any means but we were not paying for or expecting a luxury hotel.)One large King bed and one double. We traveled with our three children (under 18) and they had loved the hotel. We enjoyed (maybe) the whitefaced monkeys that traveled to the hotel at 6:30 am to hang out on the balconies and try to take whatever maybe on the rail... They were a show. I imagine that they come there to find whatever food (bananas) has been left out from so-called unknowing travelers. We saw a huge... I mean huge iguana in the tree by the family pool on afternoon. The hotel is on a large piece of property and is unique (including an airplane overlooking the jungle and ocean as a large suite.) We dined at the Anaconda for breakfast and had dinner once at La Cantina BBQ across the street. Pretty good BBQ and wonderful Salsa music that we all enjoyed dancing to. El Avion is up the road and a nice sunset. The airplane is an interesting story and the kids loved it. Although the hotel is right on the road to the beach and you do hear cars, buses and trucks, we really didn't spend to much of our day at the hotel. There is just too much to do in MA. The National Park is amazing. We went to the park 2 different days. Our first day in the afternoon with a private guide, Juan Brenes (find him in the forums on Trip Advisor.) He was excellent and we saw amazing animals. Then on our own at 8am to the third beach ~ perfect! We also explore the beach near Parador. It was pretty and you can view the 'private' beach of Tulemar/Buena Vista but it was rocky at low tide. You see a few tours stop here for snorkeling but I am not sure that they see vey much. We enjoyed our stay in Manuel Antonio and loved our room and the people at Costa Verde.
