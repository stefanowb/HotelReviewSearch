This particular Days Inn is usually our choice for a last minute trip b/c it is cheaper and sometimes one of the few places with vacancies when you book last minute. I was shocked to find that the hotel had been updated since we last stayed there. We stayed two years ago, and the hotel was looking really bad. I was actually a little nervous this time and hoping it had not become even more run down. But I was very pleased to find completely renovated rooms with pillow-top mattresses, new carpet, new linens, paint, etc. The TV remote was even brand new. They have really made a lot of improvements to the place including adding another hot tub by the pool and a water fall, as well as lots of tropical vegetation in the pool area. The hotel was much cleaner than our previous stays and staff were more friendly. The outside of the hotel could use some touch-ups but I'm not sure how much could be done to improve the exterior appearance of the hotel.", "title": "Much Improved", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Kitywhisca", "date": "August 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8429600, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location and nicely renovated rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 too many kids in the pool to enjoy swimming"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We would stay there again.
