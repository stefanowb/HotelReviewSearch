I had the electronic climate control turned all the way up but this did not make the room suitably warm for a human being. The shower room was also very cold. We were discouraged from taking showeres by the strong draft of cold air in the shower room. Still, we suffered from hypothermia and became very sick with flu and pneumonia-like symptoms. Being sick like that on the road is a bad experience. The towel rack was heated only twice a day, as was explained by the concierge, for a couple of hours in the morning and a couple of hours in the evening. It's controlled by a computer, the concierge told me. So if you want a warm towel after you take a shower, you gotta make sure you get in and out during those times. I could not figure out when it's supposed to be actually warm. Needless to say I am not used to a hotel mandating in such a manner when I can take a shower. The staff: they seem lackadaisical and not really customer-oriented. If the heating systems is computer controlled, still the staff has the responsibility to the guests to fix problems.
