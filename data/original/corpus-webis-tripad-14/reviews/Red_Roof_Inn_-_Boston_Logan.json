After another 10 minutes, our granddaughter called us from the Red Roof Inn wondering where we were. Thanks to Jennifer, the desk clerk, she and our granddaughter went to Map Quest and talked us through the process of getting back. Jennifer was absolutely wonderful and worked with our 23 year granddaughter to get us there safely. Once we were there, she was soooooo helpful. She helped us find a place for dinner, printed out directions for us to get to the Cape and then back to Logan Airport. The Red Roof Inn has a true gem of a worker in this young woman. We are so thankful to her as a part of the staff. Our stay at the Inn was very good...nice room, comfortable bed, and great serviice.
