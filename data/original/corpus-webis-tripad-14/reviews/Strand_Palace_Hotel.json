The location of the hotel is second to none. We walked everywhere as its so well signposted.

Most of the staff appear to be foriegn workers and not adequately trained. The rooms are very small but clean and ok. The TV in my room did not work. The que for breakfast took 20 minutes at 9.30 in the morning. Its as if the hotel was built for a lot less rooms, and that the original rooms, have all been divided to double or treble capacity. The hotel cannot cope with the number of guests. The reception, the breakfast room and lifts are all inadequate, and look like they were made for far less guests.

First and foremost, they should invest in installing air-conditioning. We did not need it in mid-November, but I can't imagine the same being true during the Summer. A large number of rooms are interior and the small courtyards simply do not offer much ventilation and it must be extremely hot and stuffy. Second, the television channel selection needs to be expanded. Currently, they offer a few BBC channels, Sky, a channel from Spain, one from Italy and one from Germany. We were traveling on pleasure, but stayed in on two nights as we were too tired on one night and not feeling well on the other. There was nothing to watch on the very limited channel selection. Further, anyone traveling on business would certainly want at least CNN or CNBC. It had been ages since I'd been to a hotel that did not offer at least CNN. Communication with hotel staff certainly needs some help. While the concierge was readily able to offer help, the operator refused to connect me with an ATT operator (and instead gave me a number which required me to dial for an outside line and therefore, be charged). On the night before we left, we called for a wake-up call for the following morning and actually woke up the operator. The wake up call never came on the following morning and as such, we missed a mass we'd planned to attend at Westminster Abbey.
