It does indeed have a good infrastructure with a lovely outdoor pool and a good indoor pool and gym. However, they do not bother, for example, to put the beds / chairs out around the pool and you have to drag them around yourself. You then have to clean them as EVERY chair and bed by the pool was filthy. The whole area was dirty and you felt like you were relaxing in a parking lot with a swimming pool. The reception staff were friendly, but we soon discovered that their only concern was trying to get you to book a taxi for a tour and you could not trust their advice. The bar in the lobby was staffed the 4 days we were there by a rude young woman who was making it very obvious that our requests (for a beer!) were a huge inconvenience. Breakfast was a shambles. Dirty crockery every morning. Coffee was instant from little packets. We were unable to buy a bottle of water before noon (in a 4 star hotel!). On the Sabbath non-Jewish guests were completely ignored and absolutely no information was provided that the hotel would more or less close down. On Saturday morning the reception staff were eating in the back office and it was a fight to check out. On the plus side the rooms were spacious and clean and the men who cleaned the room were very helpful and polite. Avoid this hotel. We loved Jerusalem despite staying at this hotel but it was not a nice place to come back to at the end of the day. I hated it.", "title": "Awful. Needs new management.
