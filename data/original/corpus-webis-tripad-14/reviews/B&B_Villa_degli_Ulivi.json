The location is good, with a very short, but steep walk up to town. But you can also park at the hotel for free or if you didn't want to walk up to the old Orvieto the car park to the town is not far away either. The breakfast was amazing, with so many tarts & cakes to choose from, but also there was yoghurt, fruit, cold meats & cheese etc. We really loved our stay and look forward to coming back.

The reviews are all correct, it's fabulous. You will be so happy that you chose this accommodation. Lovely building, large spotless room with everything you need and right at the base of the hill of Orvieto. You can come and go as you please with your entry card, the hosts are always available if needed. One night we came back from driving around Tuscany and wanted to view the underground caves. Daniele told us to hop in his car so he could drive us up there as we wouldn't make the last tour in time. We made it with minutes to spare and really appreciated that. He also gave fabulous recommendations on where to go sightseeing in the area. Breakfast is yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cheese/meat plate, croissants, pastries, cereal, juice, coffee, tea. The chocolate coconut cake was my fave but I did feel guilty eating it at 8:00 in the morning! We LOVED our 3 nights here and give this a five star.
