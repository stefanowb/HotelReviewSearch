The furniture in my room was damaged and the carpet just looked disgusting. Anchorage is a massive tourist town and this hotel has constant turnover, it was always busy. The hotel is in a good location, walking distance to everything. The big plus of the hotel is the A/C and heat, rooms can get stuffy, no vents in the bathroom (even saw fungus in the ceiling). Hotel is noisy, thin walls. Beds, pillows, and towels are just OK. The restaurant is OK, had breakfast there and the buffet (pricey $18.00/person) was good. There is a take out Starbucks, good little store to buy necessities, etc. There are not a lot of options in Anchorage for high end accomodations. Ate at Sacks cafe, excellent. The Glaciar Brewhouse and Orso are both good. Make sure to make reservations, there are cruise ships in town always. Great salmon, halibut, crab, etc. Lots of tourist type shopping.

Two complaints - (1) the valet parking, the only parking offered, is more expensive than in San Francisco - that's ridiculous for a city the size of Anchorage; the only alternative offered was \"Well, you can park on the street between the hours of ...\" That's not acceptable for a Hilton.
