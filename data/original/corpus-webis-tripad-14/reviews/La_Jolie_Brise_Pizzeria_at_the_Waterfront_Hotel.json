We missed the lunch hotel on the entry to the town and were recommended to try La Jolie Brise. First impressions were not good and it appeared to be more a take away than a restaurant with one cook / server in attendance. After sitting down and asked for our order, I asked for a beer and was told that this was not possible unless we dined in the bar which adjoined this cafe. It was a cafe, hotel and bar complex. The bar was comfortable with a well stacked and lit open fire. The tables were uncovered and we were provided with \"tomato sauce\" with our knives and forks. I ordered hake and chips whilst my wife had oysters. They had no mussels which we asked for. When the food arrived I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the fish and was quite impressed. This is not a place to celebrate or have a gourmet meal but is very good food and excellent value for money. Recommended for a light lunch.

I ordered 2 Regina pizzas with extra olives & pepperoni on each. The 2 pizzas cost \u20ac21, which is fine, but the toppings came to \u20ac12! I make that out at about 60 cents an olive & the same per slice of pepperoni. What a rip-off! I wasn't the only person to get burned by this while we were there & my reaction is the same as the other person's, \"you won't be catching me paying these prices again\".
