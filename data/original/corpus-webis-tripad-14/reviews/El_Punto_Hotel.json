Our experience was just great! Mariana, who owns the hotel is fantastic. Her English is great and she can give you some good suggestions as to where to eat, what to see, etc. The price was very much affordable. We have a \"studio\" room, with 2 double beds and a single. The rooms were cool (there was airconditioning), and comfortable. They were also very safe (safety shouldn't be a worry, but their was a night watchman while we were there). The hotel is NOT a hostel, as it is listed on some other website. Instead, it could be closer compared to a boutique hotel or bed and breakfast. In total, there are about 4 to 6 rooms, each with it's own bathroom (with shower), ac and a rocking chair or hammock outside each door. The hotel is painted in great bright colors and is very well kept and cleaned. The complimentary breakfast is great with fresh fruit, juice, cheese, breads and various jams (traditional latin american breakfast). We greatly enjoyed our stay at El Punto and hope to return again soon.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "MeetmeinSanJuan", "date": "March 10, 2007", "id": 7010285}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at El Punto the first night of our trip in Costa Rica and our last night since we wanted to avoid driving our rental vehicle at night and we flew in and out of Liberia.
