Our first impression of the exterior worried us however when we entered reception it was warm and cosy with an open fire and was tastefully decorated for Christmas. The rooms were more than adequate for a 3 star hotel, very much on the theme of a travel lodge or travel inn in this country, and they were fully equipped with a TV, Tea/Coffee making facilities and ensuite bathroom. The rooms were clean, well decorated and warm and comfortable. Breakfast was very good as well with cereal/cooked breakfast/toast and preserves on offer as well as tea and coffee. However, our room had very little in the way of a view over the River Liffey! The hotel is a little out of the centre of Dublin, it took us 30 minutes to walk to the main shopping centre but it was a pleasant and flat walk on a good day alongside the River Liffey. If you prefer not to walk the tram station was a couple of minutes walk away and the prices were reasonable but I would recommend you don't return to your hotel during the rush hour as it was almost impossible to board a tram at this time of day from one of the main stops (but it was Christmas!)Overall we were very satisfied with our stay here and we would definately use this hotel again.", "title": "Very satisfied with our stay here", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Annime", "date": "January 3, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4321242}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "My wife and I stayed at the Ashling in Oct.

The hotel was lovely. The only problem we had was a lack of airconditioning, but you will be hard-pressed to find a hotel in Dublin with airconditioning, and the hotel did provide the rooms with fans. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean. The location was decent--it is located across from the Guinness Brewery. It is also about 300 meters from the train station which was nice. If you are looking to stay in the center of the city, this hotel is not for you. If you don't mind walking a few miles or hopping on the bus, however, you can easily access the city center from this hotel. A pub down the street, Nancy Hands, serves FABULOUS food and a wonderful pint of Guinness. Also, a pub called Ryan's next door is allegedly the first pub in the world to be owned by the Guinness Brewery.

Overall, we had a pleasant stay at the hotel. From the outside it looks like it\u2019s in need of an update. However, the inside was quite nice and the staff pleasant. Our room (for 4 people) was a nice size, clean and comfortable. I thought the maid service was great and the people at the front desk were helpful. When we checked in from our overseas flight we were tired. The girl at the front desk (June 22) originally told us to come back for our room at 2:00 because it was not ready. The gentleman next to her saw we were tired and went the extra mile to get us our room. That was great, because I didn\u2019t want to leave my luggage in the room where it\u2019s stored (no security and the door was not locked). The last thing I wanted was my luggage stolen in Ireland. Anyway, we enjoyed the stay. The pub downstairs is great (a little pricey). The people that worked in the pub were really friendly. We went to the pub every night to watch the soccer game. The neighborhood behind the hotel is pretty bad, so I wouldn\u2019t suggest walking around. The tram was OK \u2013 it was usually crowded and with some sleazy looking people. They didn\u2019t bother you \u2013 but I would watch my wallet. It also doesn\u2019t stop in front of the hotel and you have to walk ten minutes to it. I preferred the bus across the street because it was a lot less crowded and more comfortable. You need exact change for the bus. It also took you more to the heart of Dublin. I wouldn\u2019t walk around the city \u2013 it still has some less than nice areas. But you can tell that Dublin is getting better. The only downside with the Hotel was on a Saturday night they had a party that got out of hand (for a 21 year old kid). People were in the street yelling for most of the night and you could hear it clearly from our room. They were totally drunk and nobody called the police. Don\u2019t get a room in the front of the hotel if you can avoid it. Also, some locals (only 2) were in the pub on night and they were pretty low-class. That, though, is not the hotels fault and the manger got rid of them. Most of the other guests in the hotel were nice decent people. Breakfast was OK, if you\u2019re into the Irish style breakfast. The restaurant was nice and the people friendly. I personally thought the Irish breakfast was really greasy and would not recommend it to people from the states. I really liked the hotel and thought it was good. A few improvements would really make the place nicer (like updating the outside).", "title": "Good Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jim-Mey", "date": "July 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5490457, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good Price, nice room, friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 neighborhood, outside appearance"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled with family", "text": "When I read the other reviews after booking this hotel I was a little apprehensive.
