There is a wonderful spa that offered every service you would find at any high end spa. (I had good intentions but never made it there for a massage and facial). The game drives are in comfortable land rovers with only 4 of us, not the usual 6 people. No more than 3 rovers are allowed at any one sighting so you never felt crowded and the wildlife (including wild dogs) was everywhere. Excellent game drives and I never once saw a mosquito.
