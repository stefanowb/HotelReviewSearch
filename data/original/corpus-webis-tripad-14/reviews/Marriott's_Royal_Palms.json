We arrived early and were given a room immediately. The check in process was very speedy. The 2 bedroom villas are huge and very clean. They can sleep 7 people. My only complaint with the room was that I thought the shower in the master bedroom was small. The toilet is also in the same room as the shower so if somebody is using the toilet, nobody can use the shower. So if you are traveling with a gang this can be an issue. There is another full bathroom and a smaller bedroom with a queen size bed and a chair that is a sleeper chair and can accommodate one more person or a child. This property is close to main roads and you can hear traffic and road noise from the room even with the windows closed. If this bothers you then I would suggest you go elsewhere. We asked for a quiet room when we checked in and were assured that we were overlooking the golf course and it was quiet. The view of the golf course is really nice but you can hear the traffic. Especially if you are sitting out on the balcony. If you do not like people above you then insist on a top floor. We were on the 2nd floor and had a family above us that had an obsession with being out on the balcony. We continually had to hear them slamming the sliding glass door, especially late at night. It is a short walk to the marriott hotel which is huge and is a convention center. There is also 2 other marriott vacation club properties within the royal palms complex. I would imagine that when there is alot going on at the convention center it can get pretty hectic here with traffic and chaos. There is also a shuttle from royal palms to bring you over to the marriott hotel. We walked over there and were not really impressed. I didn't think that the pool was very large for a hotel of that size. They have a large waterslide for the kids but it was closed for renovations. They have alot of restaurants but I didn't eat at any. The hotel is close to disney but you need a car to get there. I don't think the hotel provides a shuttle to disney world. This property has a market place and a small gym. The pool is small but adequate. There is no restaurant or bar onsite but they do sell wine in the lobby. If you do not like cats then do not stay here. There seems to be many stray cats on the premises and around the pool area. If you are traveling with a group and you need space then this is the place for you. The kitchen is huge. Full size washer and dryer and the 2 bedrooms and bathrooms are nice. I believe that this is one of the oldest marriott vacation club properties. The rooms have been redone.

We have also stayed at the Imperial Palms in a three-bedroom unit on the same property and were equally satisfied with that condo. This time we were pleased to be the first occupants in a newly-renovated and tastefully decorated two-bedroom, two bathroom unit overlooking the golf course (small note later about grounds-keeping at 5:00 a.m. one morning). The resort is central to everything in Orlando including Disney, shopping, restaurants and entertainment and close to highways should you decide to visit the beaches on either the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico or to the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral which are a short drive away. The pool/hot tub area for the Royal Palms is located close to the main office area and overlooks the golf course. The facilities (pools, spas, many restaurants and shops) at the World Trade Centre are also available to guests of the condos at the Royal Palms, Imperial Palms and Sabal Palms, located on the property and a shuttle service is provided to ferry guests back and forth. A small tuck shop is located on site at the Royal Palms and although the prices are fairly high, a good selection of essentials and wines/alcohol and snacks is available. The only negative that we found was that the golf course grounds keepers awakened us at 5:00 a.m. the first morning to a barrage of leaf blowers, lawn mowers and lights attached to head gear since it was still pitch dark outside.
