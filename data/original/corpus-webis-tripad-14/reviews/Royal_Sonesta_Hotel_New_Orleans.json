To start with, an incredibly comfortable king mattress and down pillows, an immaculate, spacious bathroom, extra furniture. It's obvious that the room has been completely renovated and that it was redesigned for a guest's total comfort. The room is well-appointed and extremely well-lit. There is a larger-than-usual desk and 2 chairs for your workspace, as well as an armchair in the corner. The desk faces the window, not stuck against a back wall. There are 2 phones and one of them is a cordless for your convenience. The lights and lamps are well-placed, including the light switches. When I needed to reach out, there was the desired switch.

One minor complaint...the bar at the dinner banquets served below bottom-shelf booze, and a classy, five-star joint like this shouldn't even have that junk in their liquor cabinet...I had to go to the Mystik Den to get a quality cocktail.

All of the staff were dressed in wonderful uniforms, and they were very kind. From the moment they unpacked our car and parked it, until they repacked it for us a week later, they did everything possible to make us feel like we were at home. Our room was very nice, it had french doors leading out to the courtyard and pool. The room included mini-bar and a safe. We had two small children with us and the hotel supplied us (at no extra cost) with a refrigerator for their milk. The atmosphere was one of elegance and charm.
