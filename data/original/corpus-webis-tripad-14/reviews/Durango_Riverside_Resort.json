Many of the campsites and cabins lie just steps from the broad, rock-bottom river popular with anglers and kayakers. For breathtaking alpine scenery, take a day trip on the steam-powered Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad or drive the 232-mile San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway. This campground features a large pool, game room, basketball court, pet area and lots of fun for kids. At sunset, grab a sundae at the ice cream parlor or a cup of coffee at the espresso shop, then head for the outdoor movie theater. The caf\u00e9 serves breakfast and dinner."}
