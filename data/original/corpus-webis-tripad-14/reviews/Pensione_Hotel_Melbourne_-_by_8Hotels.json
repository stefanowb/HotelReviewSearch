We were exhausted from our 30-hour journey, but we managed to find the place easily. The room was tiny tiny tiny - and shaped like a shoebox with the bed at one corner and the bathroom at the other. The bed was heaven (we ended up sleeping for fifteen hours), but it was a double, not a queen, so I don't know if two normal sized adults would be comfortable in it (we are on the thinner side of normal). The room itself was tastefully appointed in greys and browns and creams. The bathroom was literally the size of a toilet stall, including the shower, but again, was very stylish and sleekly designed. I'd say this would be a room meant for sleeping only except that we ended up spending sixteen straight hours in it - we fell asleep at 2 PM, woke up at 3 AM, and left at 8 AM, and it was still comfortable. The hotel doesn;t have an attached restaurant (they said it was being renovated) but they do offer you a 20% discount at a cafe around the corner for breakfast.
