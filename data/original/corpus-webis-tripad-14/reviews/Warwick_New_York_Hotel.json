The check-in was fast and smooth and we were in our room within minutes. The room was very large by NYC standards and very nicely decorated. We had a room with a King bed on the 28th floor. There was a nice sized entry way to lead in and then the room with the King bed, a desk with chair and another easy chair in the room. There was a nice armoire with a flat screen TV in the room as well. There was a huge closet and across from that, the beautiful bathroom done in marble. We used the concierge to book a last minute dinner the night we checked in and were very pleased with the restaurant. It's three doors down from the hotel, called Il Gatopardo, and it was fantastic! If I had to come up with one negative thing about the Warwick it would be the lack of water pressure in the shower - and that's reaching for something negative to say!
