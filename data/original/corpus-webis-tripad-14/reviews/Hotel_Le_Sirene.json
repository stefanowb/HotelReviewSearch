We stayed three nights here before moving on. The views were amazing. It was great to be able to go to Positano and Amalfi on the bus with no issues. Getting there was nuts for us but we found it no problem. We loved this place. The views were like no other I have ever seen. If you have problems with stairs than this place is not for you but other than that amazing. We wished we could have stayed longer. We did a day trip to Capri which was great and the views are amazing but unless you can afford Gucci, Armani & Rolex it is just about the views and the boat ride (which are amazing). Stay here and you will be blown away! Trip of a lifetime for us and this was the best of three Hotels (the others were in Rome & Sorrento and less about the view and place).", "title": "Perfect Place", "user": "HonestE", "date": "August 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 38871377}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel le Sirene is a lovely B & B, situated right on the cliffs in the small village of Praiano, between Positano and Amalfi, looking out over the ocean and across the bay to Positano.

We managed fine, but I think people need to be prepared. The other thing is that Praiano is a very small town. So don't expect alot of choices for restaurants or shops.
