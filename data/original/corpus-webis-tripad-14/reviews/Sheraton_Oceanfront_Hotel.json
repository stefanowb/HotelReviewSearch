Walked to boardwalk fair every night, and it was fun to watch the bands at Neptune Park. We parked our car for free across the street, and never once needed it in three days. Room was very large, and also were given a complimentary roll away bed because the sofa bed pull out had seen better days. We had a king with a pull out sofa on the 6th floor. Great vacation, loved the Sheraton, and Virginia Beach. Pocahontas Pancakes were excellent, as was PI zzeria, a few blocks down.

Weekday rates are less than weekends, so maybe that's the best route to go. We were also staying during the \"peak\" summer season, so I understand a hotel has to make the money while they can.

Only 30 feet or so from the shore it drops to around 6 or 7 feet. The waves were pretty active and a bit of a riptide.

From the front desk staff, the bellmen, housekeepers, restaurant staff to the front desk manager--everyone went above and beyond. We ate dinner once at the hotel's restaurant, Acqua Vi I think is the name. The food, wine and waiter were all good and reasonable priced, considering it's a pretty nice restaurant. Not stuffy or anything, as I wore dress shorts and a polo shirt and felt comfortable. They had a oysters rockefeller special for $2 each and the oysters were HUGE and tasty. Being on the boardwalk was also great! The Sheraton is located around 35th and Atlantic Avenue. There was an Arts and Crafts festival on the boardwalk during the day and early evening every day we were there. It was fun to check out the art booths, food booths, etc. This was a short walk from the hotel. There is also a fairly new Amphitheatre (King Neptune?) within a short walk of the hotel, right off the boardwalk, also. They had live music every night we were there, also. This was right next to the Hilton (31 and Atlantic), where we had a very good dinner. There are two restaurants inside the Hilton. One is more of a casual seafood bar and the other is more of an upscale steakhouse/seafood, called Salacia. The more casual restaurant (forgot name) also has a patio and outside bar, which was very popular every night . Salacia claims to have the best steak on the East Coast and I'd be hard-pressed to find one any better. It's a little high-priced--my NY strip steak was around $35 and that didn't include any sides (they were extra). It was delicious and the service was outstanding. The hotel has two outdoor pools and one indoor pool. We only swam in the indoor one one night for a quick dip in the indoor hot tub.

The room was small, the bathroom very, very small. The bathroom had a leaky faucet, the sheet rock on the ceiling was peeling off - it looked like it was about to fall on whomever sat on the toilet. Staff did not care, we could not get another room because the hotel was sold out (at least that's the story we got). Even though the website says free valet parking, we were told before we even asked that valet parking is not free, it was based on gratuities and/or tips ... instead of explaining to them what the word gratuities means, we just parked it ourselves (the parking lot is only across the street). Staff was not friendly, did not offer any suggestions about local attractions and/or restaurants and when we asked them where we could find a Walmart or Target they said they did not know. The pools were very small, dirty. The bar by the pool served nasty, limp, overpriced drinks. The elevators were extremley slow and smelly. We had to compete with the staff to use the elevators and usually they cut right in front of guests - apparently we have all the time in the world since we are on vacation.
