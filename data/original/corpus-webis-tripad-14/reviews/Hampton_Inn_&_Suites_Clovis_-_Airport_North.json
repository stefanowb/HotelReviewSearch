This is the nicest we've found. The room was quiet & spacious (we had the mini-suite with a couch) and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioner worked great - which is important for Valley in the summer. A nice bathroom with a very nice shower (good water pressure). Minor complaint - no shampoo provided, I think they consider the shower gel to be both a body wash and shampoo. My husband enjoyed the daily breakfast. We will definitely stay here again.", "title": "Very nice place to stay!", "user": "Cambria2002", "date": "July 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 73010806}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I'm a diamond level member of Hilton's program and travel a lot for work.
