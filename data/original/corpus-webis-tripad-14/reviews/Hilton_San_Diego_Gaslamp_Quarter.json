The room was nice, the furniture was a little bit warn but overall it was a nice room. The only draw back was that my room then faced the Hard Rock Hotel which was pretty loud. I could open the balcony and listen to music in my room. They were having an outside pool party and it was very loud, but I didn't mind.
