Trip was a birthday present for mother in her seventies, and I had spent ages going through reviews and prices. The fact that the hotel is on the third floor was not a problem at all - it meant that we couldn't get 3 people all with suitcases in the lift at one time but this really isn't the end of the world! If you have to have a ground floor reception area and a large lift, you book into a big, soulless international hotel chain and pay five times as much. If you want an intimate, family run hotel with loads of character, great staff, great value and in the centre of a unique Italian Renaissance city, this hotel is perfect, and I will definitely go back here with my husband.
