But, it almost started off very badly. I arrived at 2pm to check in and have some items placed in my room for my return later that evening. Unfortunately, my room was not ready yet and would not be ready for another hour. I left my bags with the front desk and said I would return later that evening. I received a phone call after I departed saying that another aspect of my reservation was not properly made and I would have more difficulties. The front desk put me on the phone with the manager and that is when the \"whatever, whenever\" attitude kicked in. The manager apologized sincerely and said that when I returned later that evening, I would be surprised. And boy was I ever; They gave me a free room upgrade (from fabulous to mega room), complimentary wine, chocolates, and a teddy bear, and additional candles and balloons to my original order (i ordered 6 candles and 10 balloons and got 15 candles and 30 balloons!). From that point the service was 5-star and the motto held true, whatever, whenever. Our room was setup perfectly, with the jacuzzi water already filled and at perfect temperature. The color scheme of the room mixed in with the wine, chocolates, room decorations, jacuzzi and breathtaking view made the evening one of the best romantic experiences I have ever had. Would stay at this hotel again and definitely recommend it to anyone seeking a romantic modern getaway from the craziness of downtown Seoul. 5 stars!", "title": "Started slow but finished big...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jyunos", "date": "February 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13609751, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Jacuzzi in the room", "disliked": "\u2014 Cost was a bit high, but still we enjoyed everything."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled on business", "text": "From the moment we arrived till we left we said often Wow..", "title": "W hotel = WOW", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Wereldreizigster", "date": "January 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12981683, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The design of the hotel is so nice...", "disliked": "\u2014 ?"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007", "text": "The check in went quick and they even took a picture of us..later we understood how good that works because we had a little discussion about a trip to the DMZ.", "title": "We loved our Cool Corner Room", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "PeanutButterJelly", "date": "January 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12642127, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 stylish rooms, spa, service service service", "disliked": "\u2014 proximity to downtown area."}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "That afternoon Mr. Park the manager came to us when we were in the restautant and asked if all went well and yes it went perfectly!
