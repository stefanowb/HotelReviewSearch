The public areas of the hotel are very nice, especially the extensive 5th floor deck that includes breakfast and dinner seating. Our room, a triple with balcony, was both spacious and comfortable. The hotel is a short walk from the main shopping/tourist area of Sorrento -- though the sidewalk is very narrow in places for the number of walkers and the traffic kind of crazy. Sorrento itself offers a large number of good restaurants (Antica Trattoria was especially fine, with great, friendly service and an upscale atmosphere) and fun shopping, especially in the narrow alleys of the old town. Be prepared for a bit of hiking, though, if you go to either Marina Grande ( the fishing village) or Marina Piccolo (where the ferries to Capri and Naples dock) -- most of the town is at the top of the cliff so the walking is pretty steep to and from both. Of course, the more you walk, the more gelato you can eat -- we especially liked the first gelato/sandwich shop on the main street on the right as you come into town from the hotel.", "user": "xalbguy8", "date": "May 16, 2006", "id": 5145004}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Our Room with a View!", "text": "Hotel Minerva exceeded our expectations.

This place has so much potential but they HAVE TO beef up the rooms (they look too old and musty) and step up their service. Our cable TV was stuck on one channel and movies did not work.

Minerva is about a kilometre from the city centre but this is an advantage not disadvantage. The restaurants come to pick you up to drive you into town and drop you back and you are away from the hussel and bustle or should I say chaos of the town centre. We stayed on the 6th floor and has a spectacular panoromic viw of Sorrento. It is clean, neat, has a safe, nice bathroom and comfy beds. The staff can book tours etc for you and the restaurant recommendations turned out to be good too.
