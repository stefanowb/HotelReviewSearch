I am so glad that I chose to stay at Ventana and wish I could give more stars. Elegant, yet not flashy, rustic in all of the right ways. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and were treated to a glass of wine and a very friendly staff. I originally booked the Big Sur Spa suite but were upgraded to their Pacific room and were told that we would enjoy it better (we are a couple in our late 20's). And enjoy it we did. Being from New York were everything is cramped, we enjoyed the openess of the space and especially the outdoor terrace with private jacuzzi. The room (it is almost unacceptable to call it a room because of the size) featured all of the ameneties one could imagine and the layout was tastefully put together. I enjoyed how the bathroom/tub/shower area could be opened or closed off by sliding walls. The bed/bedding was top notch, even the sunken couch simply begged for a nap in the sun-filled room.", "title": "Absolutely amazing", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Goran G", "date": "June 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131748548}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were also thoroughly pleased with the amount of service and attention to detail provided.

Our rate included an upgrade, if available and we got a king fireplace room, facing the ocean. We could see a little of the ocean in the distance (Room 121). Also, our room was very near the reception for wine and cheese, and breakfast. I loved the wood-burning fireplace in our room, with 3 bags of wood that you easily place in and light. The separate deep tub was wonderful. I loved the grounds there. At night, the firepit area was nice - in the morning also. If you are looking for a wooded view, I would recommend rooms like 12, 14, 18, 19, etc. These rooms are right at the edge of the big trees. (See the site map on their website to see what I mean). I think most people take the complimentary golf cart transportation to their restaurant. Dinner was very good with a nice view of the ocean in the distance.
