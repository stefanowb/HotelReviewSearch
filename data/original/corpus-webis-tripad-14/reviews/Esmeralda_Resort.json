We were given a room in a very quiet location a little further from than the beach than expected but the fact that is was secluded and quiet made up for it. The room itself was very clean and had a great shower/bath. The down side is that it could use more comfortable chairs on the deck and in the room. The fridge was not working but a maintenance man showed up 15 minutes later with a new one. Staff was very friendly. I would suggest renting a car during your stay to explore the island. The driving is very easy and there are some really nice beaches to visit (Friars Bay for one). Also Grand Case and Marigot are great towns to explore. Lolos in Grand Case to eat are a real bargain and good. The complimentary continental breakfast at the resort as mentioned in other reviews is pretty sparse. Toasted baguettes, yummy croissants and fruit. If you want any protein you can order eggs and bacon off the menu for a price. We did once and it was very good. All and all we had a great time. Beach chairs were easy to find. No problem with lack of chairs even in high season.

No ocean view at all, however. The rooms are rather spartan (two beds, a small table and two chairs and a dresser), and could use a reading chair or something. The small kitchenette is very handy, all the basics, a two burner stovetop, but no microwave. Also the tv is pretty basic, about 20 or 26 inches and not even a flat screen. Channel selection was great. The air conditioner made a small whistling sound which was annoying, and I complained but they couldnt fix it, and said it was normal for the new air conditioners. We got used to it after a few days! Rooms were very clean and maid service was great. The best part is that each little bungalow of three to four rooms has a small pool right outside your patio door, which is not very used so it feels like your own private pool. Our room came with a continental breakfast in the restaurant, which included fruit, juice, coffee and toast and croissant.

Rooms are configured villa-style: 4 rooms in one building, which has its own nice pool in backyard. Our \"villa\" seemed full, but you could have pool to yourself if wanted most of the time. Room was comfortable - good aircon, OK bed (huge since 2 double beds pushed together), old-fashioned TV (not flat-screen) but with many cable channels. Kitchenette included good mini-fridge. Did not use the 2-burner stove (looked old though). There was an old-looking toaster oven stowed in a cabinet. Surprised there was no microwave. Kitchen sink was odd as it was a bowl, bath-style sink. In bathroom and kitchen, tiny bugs constantly crawling all over the counters. Just tried to ignore this. Make sure you cover up personal toiletries and food. Hotel is about 5-minute walk (or less) to Orient Beach along nice path on hotel property. They don't want you to bring drinks to beach so they can sell more overpriced drinks there, which I understand, but it seems a little heavy-handed to dictate this to hotel guests. Continental breakfast included fresh fruit salad (OK), so-so fruit juice, and so-so coffee. Also toasted tartines (baguette) and couple of croissants. Could order few other items if desired for additional fee. Wanted to stay here to be close to good beach and Esmeralda delivers as Orient Beach is beautiful. Beach is mostly topless, so be aware of that if you have any issues. Watch your belongings on beach as some local guys tried to steal our sunglasses off beach table, but we caught them right away and they just handed them back. Doesn't make you feel safe when this is one of the best beaches on the island. We probably wouldn't go back to St. Martin/Maarten, but if we did, we would recommend staying at Esmeralda. Also, hotel is not in Marigot at all, as Trip Advisor indicates.

The Villas were cozy but not very elegant as other reviewers have said, but we enjoyed them. The private pool was very nice for natural swims any time of day. Our \"neighbors\" were all very nice and comfortable with nudity or topless which ever u choose. This is not a resort I would recommend to take children. The complimentary breakfast was light but satisfying and you could order \"american\" breakfast that also was good for an additional charge. We stayed in room 466 and it did have a view of the ocean from about 100 yards. Our room was very private as we were the last room on the property before you got to the ocean. Staying on Orient Beach is an \"eye opening\" affair at first, but once you see it you become comfortable with it pretty fast. The beach was beautiful and our beach boy, Thai, was very accomodating and kept our drinks from running out. The beach restaurants, including ours(Cocoa Beach), were very good for lunch. We especially liked Kontiki. For dinner we experienced several restaurants close by, L'Astrolabe(at the resort), La Plantation(just outside the resort), and I think it was called Paris, TX(at Orient Village). But my favorite was an Italian restaurant at Grand Case, IL Nettuno.
