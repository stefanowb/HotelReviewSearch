King-sized bed, quiet side of hotel. All dealings with staff were great. V. friendly and helpful. Bar and restaurant a little slow, but people were nice. The free shuttle is a wonderful service - the only bummer is that it does not start operating until 6am, too late for early-morning flights. The room was well kept and pretty clean. The bathroom could use a little love and some touch-up painting - and a light over the shower. Good-sized flat screen TV. Room service menu adequate and v. well priced for room service. I got a cup of Starbucks coffee and a yogurt parfait one morning for less than $9. Room service is usually such a rip off, it was a nice surprise. My floor was pretty loud Saturday night - lots of doors slamming and people yelling. Also had a fire at the hotel, which put us outside from 1:30-2:30 am. As helicopters circled and fire engines blared, it would have been really nice to have hotel staff circling the building telling guests what was going on. I was also surprised that no one was making guests get away from the building. It turned out to be a small fire, luckily. The price of this hotel is very fair considering all the amenities and service. I paid average of $113/nite with AAA.", "title": "Well priced, super service", "user": "MaineIzzy", "date": "October 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 21286744, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff and shuttle service", "disliked": "\u2014 communication during small fire could have been better"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at the Quorum Hotel Tampa for 6 days and 5 nights in September 2008 while attending an event in the hotel. The staff was equal to the staff at the Savoy hotel in London. The staff at all levels were extremely friendly and helpful from the housekeeping staff to the restaurant staff. The staff at the front desk could not have been more friendly and helpful from begining to end of my stay. The restaurant is small but the food is excellent. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and four fresh towels were in the room every day. I rate a hotel by the thicknees of their towels and the amount in my room. I want at least four towels, two hand towels and two face cloths, to me it is a sign of a hotel with quality. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

They will take you anywhere inside a three mile radius - two malls, wal-mart, k-mart, etc., call them and they will come back and pick you up! Although we did not book the stay and cruise package, they did offer to take our family to the port for only $20.00, half off the taxi price.
