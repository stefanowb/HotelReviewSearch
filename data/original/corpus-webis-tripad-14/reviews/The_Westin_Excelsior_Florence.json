The concierges were the best I have ever experienced. They booked side trips that were first class and the restaurants they recommeded were great. The location of the hotel was a few blocks from the heart of everything. We liked this because it was quiet and not many people around. The walk was a very easy walk to everything we wanted to see. It was very safe around our hotel for 2 women walking alone. Ate at the hotel for breakfast every morning and it was good. The service at the Excelsior was excellent!! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who travels frequently and expects the best.

The only negative is that the breakfast was a total ripoff (20 Euros for some croissants & juice). We ate at Acqua al 2 (a restauarant on Acqua street - +39 55 28 4170 make reservations & try the tasting menus) which was one of the best restaurants I ate at in Italy (also try Il cantinone in Florence).

Able to sit outide and enjoy the views and relax after a triring day of walking the city.Very nice, comfortable room.Breakfast was costly 40+ Euro so we did the a la carte menu. We were not too hungry after the traditional late dinners. We LOVE our dinner at Profeta(recommended by Concierge) short walk from hotel. Highly recommened it. Great food and very friendly service.Although you can walk to everything it is a long walk back when you are hot and tired. We were there only two days so we did not figure out how to use their buses. Told that the small bus that passes the hotel only runs along the river. May want to check with staff about how to use public transportation or use Hop on Hop off bus? Helpful staff/conceirge. Was upset though. Left my diary of Italy trip in room. Despite my repeated efforts to have them check with housekeeping and the room, was never found. I suspect housekeeping threw it away.
