I did not know a that the Swiss would allow such a place that takes it's decor ideas from somewhere between a cross between Las Vegas mixed with an African safari! Very strange! The palate of multiple colors used in my room were so loud, that even the deaf could have trouble falling asleep! However, I must say... the spa was impressive. Perhaps I am being a bit tough on this hotel. I am sure that it is a better place to stay during a warmer climate. The grounds look green and lovely on the internet...
