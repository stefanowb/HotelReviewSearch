We had booked a prestige suite - the suite is on two floors with the upper floor on the roof with sunbeds and jacuzzi - and were shown to a lovely room on the side of the hotel overlooking the river and St Eulalia. Unfortunately the smell from the river was terrible so we moved to another room in another block. We have been told that the river is due to be dredged to prevent this smell In future. It was a lovely room with a staircase up to a roof terrace complete with hot tub - see photos. The bed was very comfortable but sadly at about 6am the next morning a disco started in the next room!! We complained and were moved again this time to room 2409. At last we settled in. There were a few niggles with the room but overall it was very good. The bed was very comfortable and there was an amazing shower. The massage bath wasn't very comfortable and quite difficult to get in and out of.", "title": "Great hotel with wonderful staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Speges", "date": "September 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 177423170}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The housekeeping was excellent.

No turn down service for a 5 star hotel! filthy rooms when you looked behind curtains and sofas, in fact too horrid to describe. useless concierge that never lets you know if anything was in fact booked. Wanted to charge my family to use the indoor pool in the spa (100 eur). I did not pay. AC problems and wow was that an issue in August. No free water in room is shameful in this day and age.
