There are certainly some positives. The hotel has been beautifully renovated in a Ralph Lauren/Colonial design. Rooms, although small (it is an old hotel) are beautiful and have everything you need for a comfortable stay. I had a room at the front, which meant I had a nice view of Ocean Drive and the palm trees, but you do get the street noise, which can go on late into the night. The hotel's location on Ocean Drive, does mean that you are in the heart of the South Beach scene, but has become a bit tacky and full of a noisy, unrefined crowd. The Betsy has a beautiful rooftop terrace, which is great to get away from the crowds for a peaceful drink, early morning yoga, or a relaxing spa treatment (I had a lovely massage). There is a pool, in the courtyard - not very big and enclosed. So not the best in the area and with little atmosphere. The Fitness Room is small, but offers a nice range of equipment. The Front Desk/Concierge Staff are very friendly and helpful, as are Housekeeping and the Roof/Spa. However this is where the problems start. The Betsy is a hotel that has chosen to outsource a lot of its services. The Spa, Restaurant and Bar. The latter two to the famous New York BLT Restaurant. The first problem lies with breakfast - which is something a restaurant famed for its steaks probably does not want to do, but is necessary in a hotel. The offering is poor and the staff unfriendly and equally unhelpful. This attitude also extends into lunch and dinner service. Where the food is good, but it's let down some of the worst service I have experienced in years. This is nothing compared to the Bar ... The hotel has a lovely Lobby Lounge/Bar. Guest sitting in the Lounge are ignored and have to get up and go to the bar to order and pick up their drinks. Even if you sit at the Bar, the service is minimal and you have to practically grab the Bar Tenders to get their attention. After numerous nights of experiencing this, I then received the ultimate in arrogant, bad service (I travel the world and can say this is the worst thing I have ever encountered). My bill was presented, with the following hand written at the bottom SERVICE IS NOT INCLUDED, with the word NOT double underlined and the suggested service amounts double ringed. When I asked the Barman to explain his actions, I got little more than an arrogant, uninterested response. I clearly explained that I had been in the hotel all week, had always tipped well and found this action most insulting. I suppose you could see that many others agreed - both the bar and restaurant were never that busy. However The Betsy guests do not always understand about other company's running different parts of the hotel and the Management will be judged as a whole. BLT severely let down this hotel and as the restaurant and bar are key, they really need to address the problem.", "title": "Disappointing", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Globaladventure", "date": "November 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 144735833}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We (the family) stayed at the Betsy for 4 nights and then after a couple of days in Key West we went back home.
