It's a perfectly adequate hotel -- excactly what you would expect of a Courtyard -- no more and no less. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean. Everything worked. The breakfast was good, if not great. I did wish there was wireless Internet in the rooms -- it was only in the lobby -- but wire access was available in the room.", "user": "rwoody", "date": "March 3, 2008", "id": 14021884}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "very pleased", "text": "stayed three nights as doing a show at valley forge convention center.
