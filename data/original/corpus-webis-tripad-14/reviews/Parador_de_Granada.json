We enjoyed our 1 night stay at the Parador de Granada and found the room very comfortable, the view perfect and the ambiance delightful. And, we can't understand some of the reviews that faulted the service in the restaurant - our servers were attentive and helpful and the food excellent. The room was spotless and the bathroom very large and well equipped. The view from our room was into the rose garden pool with the Generalife in the distance - truly a million dollar view!

We booked late and were grateful to get the last standard room for which the three of us paid almost 500 euros including breakfast. We were not even checked in when a male receptionist started trying to sell an expensive flamenco show/dinner. When we refused there was no more friendly service. The beds and bed covers were those of a one star motel quality. They charge 100 euros for the third person and what you get is one of those sofa sleeper with a mattress so thin that the springs are sticking out. (Given the size of the room, I would think better hotels would not allow a third bed.) There is no bathtub in the bathroom and there is hardly any countertop space at the sink. The dividing walls between the shower, toilet and sink area are transparent glass, which is not convenient for sharing a room. The sofa bed was ready for the third person but all else was just for two people so we had to ask for the third towel, bathrobe, etc.", "title": "Stay elsewhere and save your money!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TiggerMeow", "date": "November 9, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120396146}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The next day, I was stung by a bee right outside the front door and asked for help at the front desk but they did not offer a thing.
