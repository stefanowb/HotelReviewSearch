The hotel is well located and the rooms are very acceptable with a high standard of offerings and good TV service etc. The balcony on my room, looking out to the front was also a good size and a nice feature. I had two problems both if which were small but deeply annoying!! One was pricing of wifi and wine. The wifi cost \u20ac6 per accumulated hour. It worked and was a good speed but a hotel like that, in the present day and age, should be free. The wine was \u20ac30-40 in the bar and restaurant for a basic bottle of local wine. They should be able to sell it for half of that. The second problem was breakfast. Though the food and range was excellent, the food from most of the 'hot' containers was just about stone cold on both of my mornings.
