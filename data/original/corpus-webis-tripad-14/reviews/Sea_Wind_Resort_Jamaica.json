We are a family of 4 and chose the bed and breakfast option with 2 rooms with adjoining balconies and both rooms had kitchenettes. Rooms were meticulously maintained; we always had what we needed, including beach chairs, beach towels, etc. We were able to experience the real Jamaica and it was well worth it. We always felt safe and thankful to the staff for being like family - especially to our girls - teaching them Dominoes! We went snorkeling with captain Martin (we miss you Martin - get the boat !!!) Parasailing and other activities are right next door. The photos of the hotel already posted really show what Seawind looks like . Seawind is located very close to Couples Swept Away where people spent a fortune to enjoy the same beautiful beach and surroundings that we did - on a budget! After looking at other resorts in the area, we realized that we had one of the most beautiful beach fronts.

We didn't take the all inclusive since my boyfriend and I love to eat around at different places. The room was spacious with two beds, tv, fridge and coffee maker. Nothing fancy about it but it was clean. The room was a bit warm but once I figured out the air conditioner we were ok. The balcony was a shared one but we didn't have anyone staying in the room next door so we had it all to ourselves. It was nice and quiet allowing me to sleep in while my boyfriend went for a run on the beach. The entire staff was very nice and accommodating. They gave my boyfriend bags of ice so he can ice his knees after his run, and cracked our coconuts open so we could enjoy them on the beach.
