The heat in the room was broken. As soon as we mentioned it, they brought up a space heater which did the trick. Also, requested ice was brought immediately. The bed is really comfortable, good size bathroom with good quality towels. Ridiculous to have to pay for internet - and the rate of charge even more ridiculous. Didn't try the bar or restaurant. No breakfast included in our rate. The location is wonderful. This is not a 4 star as it is billed on several sites. I would say a good 3 star. Given other options in the area that do offer breakfast and in some cases internet for around the same price, I would likely not return to the Parkcity.
