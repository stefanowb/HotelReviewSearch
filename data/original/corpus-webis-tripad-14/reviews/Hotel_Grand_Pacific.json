The staff at this hotel was absolutley wonderful. Location was perfect, close to downtown and within walking distance to and from the Ferries.

We didn't want to complain, so we just slept in the other queen bed. This was an expensive hotel and I felt that for the price, the rooms should have been more stylish.

When I finally got our room 30 minutes later, it was not the room they promised. It was on the 6th floor and the only way you get a view was if you go out to the balcony and lean over.
