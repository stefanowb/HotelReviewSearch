The owners live in a tiny area in the front of the \"buildings.\". The walls are far from soundproof so the sounds of other guests and the owners are clearly audible. The rooms, viewed by this writer by invitation of other guests and from personal experience, vary from tiny to large. One has a \"view\" of the small dirt parking lot; another has the same view as well as, by standing up and craning your neck, of Kachemak Bay, on which the property is located above the beach, which you can walk down to on stairs; you can even stop part way and sit in a swimging law chair. These two rooms, in additin to being very small, are dark and full of nautical kitsch. There is a small refrigerator and a table and chairs but you have to wash your utensils in the bathroom sink. As with all the rooms, breakfast is provivded: muffins, juice, milk, sometimes fruit and/or yoghurt packets of hot cereal and hot chocolate. Two other rooms have entries from the side of the combined maze of buildings and are considered oceanview; they are a bit larger. The premier room is in the front and has a large picture window with an essentially unobstructed view of the Bay and mountains and glaciers beyond in both the front and side of the room. There is also a deck that extends the entire length of the front of the \"buliding\" with deck chairs. This room has a small refrigerator, microwave, table and chairs behind of of the pictureTV w/VCR/DVD, sofa, queen sized bed, and decent sized bathroom with a shower and jacuzzi tub. There is also a cozy one room cabin that is built into the side of the cliff which has an unobstructed view of the Bay, etc. There is a queen sized bed, large flat screen TV with DVD, two chairs for reading, a reading lamp, a small table ad two chairs behind one of the windows, a kitchen area wiht a small refrigeratora, microwave, and sink, and a medium sized bathroom with shower. Part of the grounds are grass and have a porch swing and plastic deck chairs at the eige for great views, though it is often windy. There is also a wood-fired wooden soaking hot tub that is available for use after 7pm with Bay,. etc. views in front of the owners' living room on the grass below the deck. The owners are not very friendly and seem interested solely in getting and keeping your money. They also don't seem to realize that the property is a mess and the descriptions of the rooms are misleading. All of the above comments were made by virtually every guest who stayed at this property.", "title": "An oceanfront setting amidst a jumble of junk and building add-ons", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Frqtrvlr09", "date": "March 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 25666752}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just returned from our Alaska Vacation Homer and the BeachHouse was our first stop. It set the tone for for our amazing vacation. The Beachhouse is fabulous. You really can hear the waves while you sleep. It was great. We were there from Sept 2-6 and we stayed in the Cpmpass Rose Quarters and it was breathtaking. The cottage is furnished with authentic charm. It had a handmade quilt covering the bed. My husband has a bad back and the bed was perfect. In the evenings we would watch the tide go out and watch the otters and seals play in the Bay. They have steps to the beach that goes down to the bay. My husband walks with a cane and he made it to the beach without problems. It was a great place to start a vacation. Sue makes the best homemade breads, for breakfast. She would have fresh fruit, her homemade bread, yogurt, Oatmeal and coffee and juice in the room ready for us to fix whenever we got up. It was a perfect setup. We could eat whenever we were ready and several mornings we were gone very early. There is a swing right at the waters edge just to sit and meditate.and watch for her eagles which we saw . What an amazing place they have . . The only thing I hated was leaving.
