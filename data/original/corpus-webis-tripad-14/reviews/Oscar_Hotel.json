The area was dirty and the roof-top view was nothing worthwhile. The breakfast was horrible, and even though the breakfast hours run long, the food was usually gone after 2 hours because of the hungry mob. The staff was insulting, rude, and not helpful. I strongly advise to interact with the staff as little as possible. The rooms were very old, and need to be re-modeled. They were also noisy, our room was near the top and when they would have drinks at the bar it was so noisy we could not go to sleep. I would not recommend staying at this hotel.
