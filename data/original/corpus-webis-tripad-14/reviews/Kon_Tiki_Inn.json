When we arrived checked in and went to our room. What a beautiful view of the ocean and surrounding area of Pismo Beach. We spent the day walking the sand and went downtown Pismo too. The weather was outstanding as well. We went to Jacko's in Nipomo had a GREAT dinner and went back to our room. We sat on the Patio staring out at the beach for hours enjoying the sounds of the breaking waters. It was a great Anniversary. I will make it point to stay at the Kon Tiki Inn several times a year going forward! Rooms clean and staff very friendly and helpful. I forgot to mention the free breakfast they offer.
