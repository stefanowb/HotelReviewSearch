The rooms are wood paneled and organized tightly regarding space. The location is near the medical school, not near town. The centre of the city is \u00bd mile away and you really need to take a taxi or drive. The other sites in Modena like Ferrari Museum also require a car. The hotel serves an excellent breakfast but no other meals on site. There is a restaurant next door for lunch and dinner which is excellent. Internet is only available in the lobby by paid WiFi or use of the hotel computer (5E for your entire stay).", "title": "The hotel is a business hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MarianaG", "date": "June 7, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3535286}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Emilia-Romagna", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 34, "very good": 59, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 44}, "aka": "Real Fini Via Emilia Modena", "slim_ranking": 0.189189189189, "description": "Located approximately one kilometer from the historic center of Modena, the Hotel Real Fini Via Emilia is located about 10 kilometres from both the Modena North and from the Modena Sud Motorway Exit.
