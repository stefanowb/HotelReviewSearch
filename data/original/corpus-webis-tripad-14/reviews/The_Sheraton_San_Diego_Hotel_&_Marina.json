All the restaurants and the main pool are at the east tower, just nice. The pool side food is typical of hotel food pricey and not that great.

Had a deluxe room on the 9th floor with a great view. Room was large and comfortable, especially the beds. Bathroom was o.k.; clean, but could have been cleaner (tub). Air conditioning wasn't as cool as we would have liked it. We were able to regulate it ourselves, but it didn't feel that much cooler; but it was very quiet. We were in the West Tower, but ALL the action is in the East Tower. It is a pleasant 3 minute walk along the Marina. But after a few drinks, we had to walk ALL the way back. They have one restaurant in the West Tower. Had breakfast there one morning; it was our last. Poor service; ridiculous prices -- $4.50 for a glass of orange juice. We enjoyed the East Tower, especially Quinns (sports bar); good atmosphere. If we stay here again, we will request the East Tower (less walking). Found the desk staff at the West Tower friendly; helpful. Overall, this hotel is o.k. We would stay here again. It does sit next to the airport, but you truly are not disturbed by the air noise. In fact, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., the air traffic stops. We liked the location, and it really does have wonderful views.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jaime4692", "date": "August 21, 2006", "id": 5630156}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "My partner, son and I recently stayed at this Sheraton. As I fly often out of San Diego Airport, I often had seen this hotel which is located just across the street from the airport. From that distance, to be honest, it looks like a big 1960-ish (not too attractive) building. So, I must say that I had low expectations of the hotel when I decided to stay there. I thought it would just be a cold airport hotel where people would stay only for the convenience of the airport - not as a destination hotel. I am happy to write, however, that the hotel is much, much nicer when you are in it than how it had seemed from a distance! The service was very good (the valet parkers, the registration, bell-hops) and the views from the windows on the seventh floor were really beautiful. From one side you see the skyline of San Diego and from the other side you see the boats in the harbor/marina. The food there was also very good. My only complaint was that the overnight parking fee is quite high. We didn't hear any airplane noise, even though we were just minutes away from the airport. We just had the basic room, so that's what we got. It seemed like it had recently been renovated and was very clean and nice. The square footage seemed a little sparse (the room was kind of narrow shaped). Had a nice little balcony from which we could see the boats too! All in all, a fine place for a night or two.", "title": "pleasant stay", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "jimmydd", "date": "August 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5612227}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "My family and I just returned from our San Diego vacation where we stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina.

It arrived quick, hot and with a smile from the server who checked on us frequently to make sure things were good.

There's a great little deli (Papanani's) along the way which was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner until 8pm. They serve the best tasting ice cream!
