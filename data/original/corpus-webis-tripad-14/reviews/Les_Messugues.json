We arrived late without a booking and wanting 2 rooms, the lady that received us was brusque at first, but soon warmed and offered a package for 2 rooms for the night. both rooms were very comfortable, with little things like heated towel racks and firm and soft pillows. As it was late she showed us the breakfast kitchenette in the lobby, and just to make a note of any tea, coffee or beer wine or spirits we drank and tell the counter in the morning. Next morning a classic french breakfast with great coffee and bread and fruit. We walked around the pool and gardens,it seems a great place for a 2or 3 night stay, comfortable lounge with free computer or WiFi.

The gardens have grown and become even more delightful and colourful and the swimming pool and area are also a delight with lovely shaded areas to sit on raised decking and other lovely little niches so you don't have to be on top of others. The bedrooms are clean, comfortable and adequate with, in our case a deluxe room, a nice balcony with table and chairs and the bathrooms are a good standard. However the televisions are very small and contrary to what is advertised the satellite is limited to 15 French channels with no news channels in French or English. or any language. You can however receive wi/fi in your room. For the price of a deluxe room, now from 140 euros without breakfast, the television is not really good enough if you are staying for several days.

We found a mouse dropping in the teapot which we did not discover until it appeared in the cup ,which we found most disconcerting as it was after we had drunk most of it.. As the cafe is in an outside separate building this is entirely possible and rodents can easily climb in and out, but care should be taken over this. When we mentioned it diplomatically and quietly, it was dismissed as dust and thrown to the ground and stamped upon, so that we could no longer comment nor identify the dropping. The next day we decided not to eat there again as apart from this, some things seemed to be prepared and stored badly, and so we took a small baguette to the sunbed and ate it quietly with a drink under the trees. A lady advanced upon us and in a very impolite manner and with minutes of rude banter (all in French, I hasten to add we spoke French all the time), we were told to eat nothing at the pool unless we used the cafe, in spite of our experience the day before, they paid no heed to this nor apologised but from then on treated us dismissively. One would have though they could have been a little embarrassed and would have understood that we would prefer to eat our own food. By that token you could not even eat a sweet or biscuit or have a bottle of water by the pool.

We did this and were greeted by the same lady (who told us not to eat at the pool later), and she was not happy with our late arrival and made it very plain. So, sadly this is not going to be a hotel we would return to, nor recommend. It has so much going for it, but at the moment the family presence is very obvious and does seem to take over their lives so that guests can seem a bit of a bore. We wanted to love it but things need to improve, especially as there are no restaurants/cafes nearby or shops to buy daily requirements, and if they are not too friendly, this could soon start to affect their business and it is not that marvellous that they can afford to get away with it with the euro as it is and the general cost of things. The hotel is in such a perfect quiet setting (no view just vineyards) that they should not become complacent.
