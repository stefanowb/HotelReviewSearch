I wished they would have labeled the individual pieces, but it was fun to ride around the park anyway. Entrance to the park is free if you are a guest of the hotel, but that's where anything free ends. Even to use one of their (disappointing) bicycles to ride around the park, they charged RMB10 per hour (for comparison, bikes in Yangshou rent out for RMB 20 for the full day and for that price you get a pretty decent mountain bike, versus the wobbly rusty fold-able type bike at Yuzi)", "title": "Great Place, Awful service, a dissapointment", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "miss_saigonlondon", "date": "August 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8492762, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rooms are nice and comfortable", "disliked": "\u2014 The (total lack of) service, which can ruin a holiday.

One month before we were set to leave for China, Departures Magazine published an entire issue on China, and devoted a page to HOMA. The pictures were breathtaking - the rugged karsts of Guilin in the background surrounding a very modern hotel with many enormous modern sculptures. I cancelled our intown hotel reservations and reserved a room at HOMA. The drive from the airport took 40 long minutes, as my husband - tired and out of sorts - was sure we should have stayed in town and let me know this. Until we arrived, when he was silenced by the beauty of the grounds. Beautiful as the pictures were, they dull in comparison to the actual compound. We were warmly greeted and given a large room (which looked like it could have been assembled at IKEA- comfortable, but nothing to write home about). The food, however, was wonderful, even though we had arrived too late for a regular dinner. The next morning I got up early, and had breakfast outside with an official contingent from Taiwan. There was a buffet - delicious and beautiful, but similar to that in any first class hotel - and the waitresses who had served us the night before greeted me. We took the Li River cruise (which disappointed me because there is a parade of boats which proceeds up the Li River, making the trip seem very touristy; if I were to take the trip again, I would look for a more private way to go), then rushed back to the hotel for dinner before going to an ethnic minority show in town. The staff had asked if we would like to go on a \"picnic\" because we were special guests (I thought this might be because we were the only guests at this point and they didn't want to open the dining room just for us; the hotel hadn't been open long, and not many people knew about it). That evening, as the sun was setting, a go-cart took us outside the compound (the hotel grounds do have a gate) and onto a seemingly endless swath of land, the karsts in the background glowing in the setting sun and nobody to be seen for miles - so very rare in China). We felt as though we had wandered into a movie; we had never experienced this sense of privacy, not even on safari in South Africa. As we rounded a turn, we saw a table set in the distance, white linen waving in the wind. I thought it must be for the owners of the property, until we pulled up and our waitresses greeted us. The table was adorned with white roses, fruit drinks and Mongolian hotpots. Our waitresses offered us a choice of white wine or Chateau Lafite-Rothschild. My husband and I agreed that it didn't matter how much it cost, we were having the Chateau Lafite-Rothschild. As the sun set behind us, we drank the entire bottle of wine. The go-cart arrived as though by magic, and took us back to the hotel. When we pulled up we heard haunting music; bathed in colorful lights were a singer and musician standing on a bridge over the pond. Our driver stopped to show us the neighboring bathroom, which was built like a cave, with organic shapes mimicking stalactites and stalagmites. We had to rush to make the show. We only wished that we could have had more time at the hotel; they rent bikes and you can ride around the immense grounds. The next morning we paid our bill and left - our \"picnic\" was under $100 - expensive in China, but well worth it. I almost didn't write this review because I hate to share this secret, but I have learned so much from TripAdvisor and wanted everyone to have this special experience.
