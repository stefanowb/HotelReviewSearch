It is very close to the airport - an easy 10 minute ride by tram and near to a growing array of international company head offices - which must be pretty much the only reason to stay here. It would appear to cater for conferences too. The lobby is glossy but the rooms don't reach the same standard although they are perfectly acceptable. The train line runs right behind the hotel so you can't have your window open unless you are at the front. They don't have minibars so if you want water or anything else they have a strange little shop are near to reception. You have to pay for wi-fi - a staggering 30 SF, and breakfast is a staggering 35 SF to eat mediocre fare in what feels like a canteen. This is on top of the cost of the room which was enormous as well.
