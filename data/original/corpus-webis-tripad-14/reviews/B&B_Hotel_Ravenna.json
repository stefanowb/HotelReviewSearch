It's very similar to an American Holiday Inn. Hotel was new, clean, and very modern. It is however, outside of town and too far away to walk anywhere. I did not eat at the dinner at the hotel, because I though it was pricey - 20 euros for dinner. The breakfast was good though - even had American cereal.
