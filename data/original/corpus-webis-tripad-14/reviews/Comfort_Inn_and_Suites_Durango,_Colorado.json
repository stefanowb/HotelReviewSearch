We were very happy with this hotel. We were about 1 mile south of Downtown, we had no problem with that, Wal-Mart is down the road too. We got great rates to stay here, $62.99 a night for each room. Rooms were very clean, we had an issue with our shower valve, but it was resolved within minutes. The only thing I did not like are the pillows, they are deceiving, look very nice and comfortable, but they would go flat as pancakes. We had to use 2-3 pillows each. No pets are allowed and no smoking, that was one of the main reasons for staying here. The breakfast was good, they had waffles, assorted juices, milk, coffee, toast, bagels, english muffins, tortillas, eggs, eggs with sausage, biscuits and gravy, donuts, muffins, etc.. Overall we had a nice experience, we would stay here again.", "title": "Nice Place and Very Clean", "user": "kjshurbet", "date": "June 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 31319407}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Situated on the south end of Durango -- the hotel was nice and clean.
