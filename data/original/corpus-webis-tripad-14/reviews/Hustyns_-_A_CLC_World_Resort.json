Gorgeous gardens, woods, and surrounds and extremely helpful, friendly staff. Absolutely one of the best hotels I have ever, ever stayed in the UK. There were some worries that someone might pitch a timeshare at us but there was nary a mention of that. We took a great bike ride, organized by hotel down through the woods to the Camel Trail and into Padestow we we had Rick Stein's Fish and Chip plus tried his pastie (the best cheese and onion pastie we had ever tried). Breakfast was good although it took us a day to realize we could also order omlettes etc. Only one tiny weeny niggle. I would like to see a healthier menu with fewer chips (what about boiled potatoes etc) on the menu. This hotel has a veggie and herb garden and I would love to see that reflected in the menu. More salads please and what about some of Mr Stein's pasties on the menu. It's only a small niggle but I work in food activism and know there's some fab local food around this area.

We enjoyed a meal in the restuarant whilst an acoustic guitarist entertained. The staff couldnt have been more friendly.

One thing to point out though, if you do go on a promotional break, it won't be 90 minutes!! Ours lasted a pleasant 3 hours which included full free breakfast.

I let out a sigh and wanted to say \"go away\" but wasn't quick enough. I was talked into a four night break for two for \u00a379. I said there was no way financially we could afford to buy into a timeshare but was promised there would be no hard sell. The drive to the hotel was quite an experience. When the satnav said \"turn left\" we said \"no way\" but it was correct. Most of the last five miles to the hotel are one vehicle only lanes so if you are of a nervous disposition perhaps this isn't the place for you. However, we arrived in one piece and by the end of the four days the journey to the hotel was a doddle. Very friendly people at the hotel. Our room was really nice. It overlooked the car park but that didn't affect us at all. We ate there the first night. Service was excellent, as was the food. The only place your mobile will work is in the restaurant/bar area so if you want to disappear for a few days, this hotel is ideal. The timeshare talk went on a bit. I liked the salesman (Jason) but it annoyed me when he kept on calling over the Manageress, then the Financial Manageress, then back to him and then again and again. Anyway, the tour around the cottages was very interesting. These cottages are out of this World but way too expensive for us to join the Club and pay the yearly fee. We managed to say no and although they were disappointed, they \"agreed we could leave the Talk\"(!) At the end of the day, this is a Members' only hotel and so the standards have got to be high but at no time did we feel out of place and were treated with respect at all times.", "title": "Great Cheap Long Weekend", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Catawayo", "date": "October 30, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119907079}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 17, "very good": 57, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 111}, "aka": "Hustyns Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.75, "description": "Surrounded by 100 acres of beautifully landscaped private gardens and woodlands, Hustyns luxury country hotel enjoys panoramic views over North Cornwall\u2019s legendary Bodmin Moor.
