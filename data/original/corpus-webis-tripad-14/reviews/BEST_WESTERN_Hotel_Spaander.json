It's trading on its past glories, which would be fine if the fittings were all antiques, but they're not, it's become a mish-mash of styles and fittings. The room we had, 117, was very small, and with a minuscule bathroom with poorly laid-out fittings - my wife is 5' 4 1/2\" and she couldn't see herself in the mirror, because the mirror had been installed by a member of the Dutch basketball team!", "title": "Greatly in need of a refurbishment", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mel_the_traveller", "date": "June 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 132204496}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The restaurant served food popular in the 1970s - heavy sauces and fried accompaniments with everything.

I became ill and was traveling by myself, I called down stairs and asked for tea, coke or something that would ease the stomach pain.

I went down and got some hot water, even though I was in pain. The pain persisted I called because the information in the room said call if a Doctor is needed. I called they said just drink some 7up and I would be fine. I was awake to the early morning when pain subsided. As far as this hotel was concerned or not concerned, the maid; if more serious could of found me in the morning, in not so pleasant a situation but thank goodness I ended up fine.

The room we were initially put into was a joke. It was in the attic, meaning that on one side of the bed, it wasn't just impossible to stand up, I doubt it would have been possible to sit-up in bed. Also, the windows were tiny - definitely necessary to leave the lights on during the day (the spiders weren't too impressed at being disturbed when I opened the window either). The bathroom was even funnier. As the \"shower\" was in the eaves, it consisted of a 3ft sq tub that you sat in to shower yourself - height clearance was at most 4 ft.
