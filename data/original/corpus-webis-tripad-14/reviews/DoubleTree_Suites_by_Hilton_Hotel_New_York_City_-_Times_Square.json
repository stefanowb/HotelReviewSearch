The \"cowboy\" that greeted us and checked us in immediately provided me with the most up to date broadway shows available. Several staff members were a frequent source of knowledge that made our stay so much better. Our quarters, a corner suite, were exquisite. Extremely clean, spacious and comfortable. The elevators were clean, quiet, and super fast. We stepped out right onto the center of Times Square. We were literally only a few moments from everything. The Greyline Bus tours are wonderful if you want to sightsee.
