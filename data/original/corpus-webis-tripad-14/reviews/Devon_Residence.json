Let me say, right at the outset, that I feel that having a rental car is probably a \"must\" for older travelers, or anyone with mobility issues. There are many buses available that cover almost all of the island of Mahe, but Devon is located up the side of a steep, curving road that is a good quarter mile from the main coastal road that pretty much circles the island. That should not be too much of a problem, as Jane, the owner, is able to arrange very reasonable car hire from a local company, which will deliver the car to the residence and also allow you to drop it off at the airport. Jane can also arrange a taxi pickup or dropoff to the airport, if desired.", "title": "Wonderful, cliffside bungalow with marvelous view!", "user": "maestrolms", "date": "October 15, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 181168254}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012", "text": "My lodging was in Bungalow #2, which had a single large bedroom with a Queen-sized bed,", "title": "Fabulous", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Berns23", "date": "June 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 131360018}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "a bathroom with a walk-in rain shower, and a good sized parlor-dining area and small kitchen.
