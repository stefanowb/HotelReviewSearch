Also, the bar has good happy hours deals - sometimes 2 for 1. In addition, there are a few local steak houses, a coffee house and a bank within walking distance (like across the street).

The hotel is not too far from the Airport, about 15-20min. Taxi fare is on a fixed rate by zones, so from the Airport this hotel was about US$15. Upon arriving, i noticed that the staff at this property were very friendly, and accomodating. checkin was fast and smooth, My room was very clean and bright and fresh with everything in very good condition. My room was looking out the back of the hotel away from the main street, The nice view included a skyline view with very nice sunset that evening.The Bed is in great condition, as are all the furnature. I had a very nice restful sleep. Aircon/Heat is controlled by Thermostat and works great. My room was very quiet as was the hotel. I think the hotel was 1/2 full, but i did not see anyone. I ate in my room that night, and Room service that night was truly an excellent meal, moderately priced. (i thought so). Should you want to eat downstairs, there are two restaurants with different menus. Both rest had many items to choose from. There was a bar downstairs as well. There is a hotel gym that is small but did the job nicely. Internet access was for a fee, was very fast and reliable for my stay.

Guests that participate in the hotel's loyalty program \"Fiesta Rewards\" receive free internet and discounts on restaurant and hotel gift shop purchases. The business center is well equipped. Staff was welcoming and helpful. Fax service, printing service, computer access is available in the business center, which is somewhat like a nice lounge. The hotel has a nice bar, an all purpose restaurant used for breakfast and other meals. The adjacent \"El Rincon\" restaurant in the hotel offers a variety of steaks and typical Sonoran meals at reasonable prices. Menus are available in English. The hotel has a beauty shop and tobacco shop. The hotel is of an older design, but everything worked. TV's were not flat screen but were adequate. Toiletries in the bath were better than average, with complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste and designer soaps. Maid service was unobtrusive. The hotel can be packed with business meetings and groups. A quieter hotel is the next door Fiesta Inn, operated by the same chain and catering to business guests.
