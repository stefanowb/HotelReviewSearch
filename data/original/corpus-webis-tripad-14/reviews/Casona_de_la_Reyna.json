This hotel was quite memorable for many reasons. We stayed in room #1 (up two or three stairs and across from the front desk.) It was huge! The master bedroom had a large bed, a small desk, TV, ample closet space, and a full bathroom. Attached was a small living area. In addition to a couch (which likely converted into a bed) and a chair, there was a desk and a chest that held another TV. The living area also had another large closet and a 3/4 bathroom. Needless to say, the room was quite comfortable. Although our room overlooked a small turnaround that was also a bus stop, the street was very quiet. Also, even though we were close to the front desk and small dining area, we never heard any noise. The breakfasts were quite good, with a variety of cereals, meats, cheeses, pastries, juices, and fruit. The staff was quite friendly and accomodating at all times. I also appreciated having access to a computer in the lobby area. There's limited free parking in front of the hotel. We weren't lucky enough to find a place out front, but were satisfied to put our rental car in the paid parking below the hotel. We had some difficulty finding the hotel, but a friendly local police officer helped us after we discovered we were driving in circles. The hotel is at the bottom of a fairly steep hill, which some may find daunting. However, there was also a railing alongside the buildings up the hill, which helped our ascent and descent. Because the bus stopped outside the front the hotel, I believe those who would have trouble navigating the hills could choose the bus as an easy alternative.", "title": "Memorable Room", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LindaPTucson", "date": "October 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10405015, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The size of the room and the atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 The trek up the hill to the main part of the center city"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We drove to Toledo and were pleased to find this hotel in the old part of the city.

Clean well decorated room overlooking River Tajo. Parking on street just outside, although hotel has own car park. Buffet style breakfast of cold meats, cheese, cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit and pastries was superb. Staff extremely friendly and courteous and gave excellent recommendation to visit Aranjuez and Chinchon, as we had time to spare before catching flight back to London. At GBP50 for room and breakfast per night, it represented excellent value. Location at southern end of city means there is an uphill climb into the centre through the narrow cobbled streets, although a bus stop is just outside the hotel on the opposite side of the road. We would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable no-nonsense type of hotel at a good price. Casona de la Reyna is part of a national hotel chain, which operates two other hotels in Toledo. Toledo itself is a charming historic city with plenty to see and do.
