The rooms were clean, comfortable and had an amazing view. Every morning we woke-up to the smell of freah bread being baked for us!! Mila, was an amazing wealth of knowledge and really added to our time in Barcelona. We had asked if we could leave our luggage there for a couple hours after we had checked out because we had an evening train to Madrid and she said no problem. We left our final payment on our bed and when we returned, all of our cash was sitting on our luggage because they were not sure what it was for. It was just another example of the character of the hotel.", "title": "What a wonderful find", "user": "luvs2trvllots", "date": "August 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37714262}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Our family of 6 (4 teenagers aged 12-18) stayed 3 nights pre-cruise at Marina View B and B. Our rooms were spacious, the beds and pillows firm but comfortable and the linens were of good quality. The room had a safe which was very useful. Our breakfast was delicious; fresh pastries, breads, cheese, juice and coffee, much more than we could possibly consume. Excellent bathrooms and showers in each of the two rooms we used (3 to a room, one double bed and a futon-type day bed or hide-a-bed). Small balcony/French window in each room gave us a wonderful view of the harbour and the activites in the port tourist areas and was a fantastic viewpoint for watching the fireworks one night. There was a small elevator to the floor where both our rooms were located (Maremagnum room and Columbus room) in this historic old stone mansion right across the street from the marina, Olympic plaza, Port Vell, restaurants and just around the corner from La Rambla. The sightseeing bus stop was right across the street. Easy walk to Plaza Catalunya and Gothic Quarter. A taxi to the cruise ship terminal at the end of our stay was reasonable in price (we needed a van for 6 of us and luggage) and it was a very short trip to the terminal, the taxi dropping us off right in front of our cruise check-in line. Getting to the B and B on the first day from the airport to Drassanes train stop was simple but crowded and busy (beware of pickpockets who are on the trains. It happened to us). You emerge from underground at Drassanes stop and then a short 5 minute walk with rolling luggage to the B and B.", "title": "Perfect location, friendly staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "shewholovestraveling", "date": "August 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37282104}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Jose-Maria and Mila our hosts were extremely friendly, very helpful in recommending sightseeing and restaurants.", "title": "Awesome Stay", "user": "Winnie54", "date": "August 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37278470}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We chose this place to stay in Barcelona primarily because of the reviews on this website and we were not disappointed. First, the location was excellent, close to everything and we had a very nice view from our balcony in the Maremagnum Room. This room was a triple with a large bed for my husband and me, and a comfortable single for our 23 year old son, and everything was super clean. Mila and Jose Maria, our hosts were so welcoming and helpful, and so genuine. You could feel that they really wanted you to feel welcome and to get the most out of your trip to Barcelona. The breakfast was timely and delicious, taxis were hailed when needed and directions in Spanish were given to the drivers, and always done with a smile. I hope that we will be lucky enough to stay there again if we ever visit Barcelona again. Two things that we really enjoyed were the fat tire bike tour (a great way to see everything from historical sites, Gaudi's architecture, to the beaches) and the flamenco dinner & show at Tablao Cordobes (very high energy), both of which were located close to this B&B.", "title": "Great B&B - great location", "user": "Anabella-BuenosAires", "date": "August 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36595505}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a great B&B: excellent location, super friendly, helpful and profesional service, impecable room infrastructure.

We had a real early flight the next morning and debated staying near the airport. This was the perfect location. We figured it would have cost us $60 to get to the airport, check in, then another $60 getting back to Las Ramblas for sightseeing, then another $60 back that night. Not to mention the time wasted. Marina View is a short cab ride from the port, right on the main street, a few steps from Las Ramblas. Though the outside is nondescript, the rooms are clean, roomy, well decorated and very reasonable! Mila was such a help to us. She let us use her computer to check in for our flight. She suggested sites and restaurants. Importantly for us, she arranged the cab to the airport so we would be sure to have a ride and not be ripped off. Then she even got up 4am and waited with us to make sure the cab was there and on time! Even though we had to leave too early for breakfast, she had coffee and sweets for us in the room for the morning, which was perfectly hot in the thermos. We were there with another couple and it was the perfect place for us!
