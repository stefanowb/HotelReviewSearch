The hotel is fantabulous, the staff -very friendly and helpful and the studio apartments are beautiful with a cute sitout.They include breakfast and city pass in the room rate. I just fell in love with this place and would recommend this to all. It is true value for money. I just wish they had branches in Paris and other European cities.

That's what we learned the hard way after a horrible first night. There were so many sirens, motorcycles, trucks, etc. that I actually took my pillow and blanket and slept (or tried to) in the bathtub for three hours. It was the only completely quite place in the whole suite. We had a room on what they call the second floor, which, because of the way the hotel sits on a hill, is actually below the lobby level, with no view - so ask for a room on a high floor. Aside from these problems, we still enjoyed the Ema house. The only hotel we visited that had more than one English TV channel (CNN). Believe me after hearing the same stories over and over again on CNN it's really a treat to be able to watch something entertaining. The EMA house also provides free movies in English - another nice treat. The breakfast was delicious and of very high quality. I'm pretty particular about coffee and it was very good. We asked how much it would cost to get an egg with breakfast and they told us $7 for one egg. Needless to say, we went eggless. he refrigerator and microwave were appreciated. We got two free 24 hrs. tram passes each day. Great for visiting all parts of city. We went to the lake, which was beautiful as well as the zoo which we really enjoyed and would recommend.
