The hotel was okay, but certain aspects of it were infuriating. Our room was on the second floor, directly above the main, Chinese, restaurant. The worst problem with the room was that it was always HOT. We could not get it cool and management was not helpful in this regard. In retrospect, we probably should have insisted that they move us to another room, as they did not appear to be full. Outside the temperature ranged from around 25 - 41 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm not sure what the temperature was in our room, but both my sons and I were uncomfortable all the time---we slept with as few clothes on as we decently could and we resorted to turning on very, very few of the lights, which were mostly either halogen or incandescent. The second worst problem was that the dresser drawers were very poorly built---they were shallow and they scraped and dropped wood shavings all over the clothes. In addition, the carpet in our room was old, very worn, and permanently dirty and the cleaning staff replenished the 3 small bottles of hotel-branded water only twice during our stay. Finally, apparently because of its location right above the restaurant, the hallway smelled of kitchen exhaust, which was just really unpleasant. On the plus side, the beds and pillows were comfortable and the bathroom was nice. The staff was generally very nice; however, they did not appear to know that the fifth line subway was open (or how to get to it, even though it is very nearby) and it was not shown on the hotel's subway maps. Their English language skills were adequate. The breakfast buffet, which was included in the room was pretty good---there were lots of choices and I would think anyone could find something to eat that they like. The hotel is conveniently located for shopping and to major tourist attractions. I would be very hesitant to stay at this hotel again. I certainly would not stay on the 2nd floor and I would ask specifically if the air conditioning in the room had been recently replaced.", "title": "Very disappointed", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "AnotherFla.Mom", "date": "December 31, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 12154755, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The beds", "disliked": "\u2014 The temperature in the room"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed 2 nights here at the end of our holiday in China. Our internet booking had not been received by the hotel and they were not helpful in sorting this out. It was seen as our problem not theirs. We were staying in the King club level and would have expected more VIP service. When we were finally able to contact Wotif.com they were extremely helpful and sorted out our problem straight away. The room was a bit dated, but reasonably opulent. The bathroom was huge and luxurious. I am not sure I like the inward looking hotel rooms, where the windows overlook the central atrium and all can see me if I dont keep the windows shut. Breakfast was ordinary. The hotel is located in Wangfujing street but it is a good walk to the main restaurant and shopping areas, so not quite as well located as the address made it sound.", "title": "OK hotel in good location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JulzE", "date": "December 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 12004483, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 bathroom", "disliked": "\u2014 staff were unhelpful"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic hotel in Beijing!", "text": "I stayed at the Crowne Plaza from December 11-17, 2007. The location was fantastic--near the Wangfujing pedestrian shopping street. The lobby was was very nice, all decorated for Christmas. My room was great--room 202. Spacious marble bathroom and nicely decorated room. Nice duvet filled with silk batting. Bottled water and toiletries provided. Used the concierge to book tickets and also used the business center to book my day tours. Staff very accomodating. I have an account with Bank of America, so I could use the China Contruction Bank atm's with no fee. There was a branch located across the street near the KFC. I went to the the Beijing Dept store a couple of blocks away for my drinks and snacks--on the lower floor there is a small grocery. There is also a larger grocery at the department store at the other end of the pedestrian part of Wangfuging. I am glad I went in December because it was low season, the sun was always out and skies were blue--the winds seemingly blew the pollution away so the air seemed a lot cleaner than in Xian where I was before Beijing. The temperature during the day was in the mid thirties. I wore my down coat, hat and mittens and was fine. I only wore my long underwear once. I don't think I would ever travel to China from March to November which is when there are lots of tourists. The next time I come to Beijing I will definitely stay at this hotel. Since it was low season the rates were excellent. I booked directly on the hotel's website. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the smoking in the lobby. The taxi to and from the hotel to airport was about $15 each way.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "mango_eater", "date": "December 26, 2007", "id": 11970499}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Spent five nights total (a three-night stay then a two-nighter at the end of our trip) at the Crowne Plaza in Beijing last week and, while already optimistic about our stay, thanks to other Tripadvisor reviews, am now plesed to say our expectations were surpassed.
