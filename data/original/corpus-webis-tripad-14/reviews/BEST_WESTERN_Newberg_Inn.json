This is my fourth stay at this hotel, and it's even better than before as they have replaced the carpeting and furniture. The front desk staff, especially the manager, are very friendly, helpful, and responsive. I've always booked mini-suites, which are extra long rooms with a couch, comfortable chair and desk in the sitting area that is walled off by a half-wall. The exercise room is small, but functional. There is a very clean guest laundry and nice indoor pool. The breakfast is normal continental fare, with a waffle maker. There is a nice breakfast room with sufficient seating. I normally stay in Hiltons and Marriotts, so am used to very nice hotels. The Newberg Inn is not in that class, but it's one of the nicest Best Westerns I've ever stayed in. The only downside is that there is no elevator. If stairs are an issue, make sure you book a downstairs room.", "title": "Best place to stay in Newberg", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Calif0rnia_traveller", "date": "August 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8467495}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good Clean Hotel", "text": "We just stayed for one night as we passed through Newberg and stayed at this Best Western as we have stayed in others which we were very impressed with. This was a clean but a bit older hotel, had nice large pool and hot tub. The beds where alright nothing to write home about. The Cont. breakfast was not a exspansive as the others I have been in. Very small eating area with only two tables so felt a bit rushed to give someone else a place to sit. Had cereal, waffles and some bagels and coffee. Also very crowded small area to even get your items. It was quite and the staff we meant where very polite and nice. Not sure if I would stay here again or not.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "momtoo", "date": "April 17, 2005", "id": 3370338}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Newberg"}, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 17, "very good": 31, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 19}, "aka": "Best Western Newberg", "slim_ranking": 0.4, "description": "Best Western Newberg Inn is in heart of wine country.
