Upon arrival at 11:30pm we were infomed that the hotel did not have any record of our reservations. We made the reservations a week before our stay and were given a confirmation number, however, the desk clerk did not have any record of such a reservation. I was very upset as I thought we would have to either sleep in the car that night or find another hotel, but the Inn did have a room available for us to stay in.

My son And I were returning home from the Boston area and decided to stay here for the night. The only thing good about the place was the front desk staff! Our room smelled terrible a cross between a backed up sewage problem and mildew. Initally they didn't want to give us another room (only to spray some type of deoderizer) That was just not acceptable. They did switch our room and it was a bit better although the bathroom tiles were all cracked,there were burn marks on the vanity, there was a chunk of paint ripped off the door and the room was old and dated.The bedding was clean but extremely wrinkled. There was supposed to be coffee and tea in the lobby area but the canisters were empty and when it came to the free continental breakfast there were so many people and no seating for them. It was a stand up meal in the lobby for many . We had already checked out or we would have returned to our room to eat our stale breakfast items.
