It is in the heart of Venice and everything is within walking distance. There are ample resturants and shops next to the hotel. The rooms are nice and large for a european hotel and the staff could not have been nicer. I would recommend this to anyone staying for the first time in Venice because of the location and it's helpful staff.

The stuff was beautiful and you get a 50% discount off the marked price, we were unable to purchase any because we would have had to get it back to Australia, however would have loved to! Be warned though that the tour ends in the souvenir shop of the factory and you have to find your own way back to the hotel (we weren't told this).

It was an excellent choice and well worth the price we paid for a junior suite with a canal view. The water bus stops just in front of the hotel and makes all of Venice accessible all day and night long. The suite was large enough for four women and their luggage, so no complaints regarding the size of the room. However, the bathroom was on the small side. The decor is typical Venetian and you really feel like you are getting a real taste of Italy. We weren't bothered by the foot or boat traffic along the Grand Canal. Breakfast was included but we never made it down in time. Having the Rialto markets right outside was very convenient for picking up last minute souvenirs. I would not recommend the hotel restaurant. The service was poor and the food wasn't very good. However, right next door there is a little place with great panini sandwiches.

Prices were reasonable compared to the Riva Schiavoni & St Marks Sq area. The famous Rialto markets are right opposite, just across the bridge and St Mark's Sq a 10 minute stroll through the lovely winding Venetian streets & alleys. The staff at the Rialto were multi-lingual & very friendly & helpful on the whole. Continental breakfast was buffet style with a very wide choice & hot breakfast items available for a small suppplement. We'd definitely want to stay here again when we do back to Venice.

Do let them know if it's a special occasion, in our room there was a bottle of Prosecco and 2 glasses in a cooler on our arrival as it was our anniversary. A huge benefit of the Rialto Hotel is how easy it is to find - right by the 1 & 82 vaporetto stops so you don't have to spend any time hunting through the back streets with your luggage in tow - remember you can't take a car to your hotel so this was an important point. All traffic stops at the Piazzale Roma and you're on a boat from there so we were relieved to be in a hotel whose location made the journey so easy.

Venice City is an island (or rather a series of islands) set out about a mile or so from the Mainland in a sea water lagoon. It is connected to the Italian mainland by a causeway which carries a railway line and a roadway. Both the railway terminus and the end of road transportation is at the end of the causeway at Piazzale Roma (Rome Square). Venice's airport - Marco Polo Airport - is on the mainland about 10 miles away from Venice City, (although some budget airlines - like Ryanair fly to Treviso Airport, about twice that distance away). If you fly into Marco Polo the choice of transport to Venice City is either by private water taxi (90 Euros per boat one way); or a combination of bus or taxi to Rome Square/ Piazzale Roma (the closest place that road vehicles get to Venice City) and then transferring to a Vapporetti water bus (5 Euros per person) from there along the Grande Canal to the Rialto Vaportti stop - right outside the hotel. We pre-booked a taxi transfer with ATS (airport transfer services) which was 30 Euros to Rome Square and got the Vaporetti afterwards. Total transfer time about 1 hour. There's also an hourly express water bus from the Airport to St Marks Square (15 Euros each) - but you'll still need to get the Vaporetti from St Marks Square to the hotel at an extra 5 Euros each. The top tip really is to get the more expensive but \"door-to-door\" private water taxi from the airport and save all the fuss. Now the Rialto Hotel -what a great hotel! We stayed at the Rialto late last month, during Carnevale week in Venice. This was our first visit to the city and the carnival atmosphere certainly added to the experience. Carnevale is the week or so leading up to lent each year. The hotel is a charming 3 storey pink building, about 150 years old, set among similar buildings, right on the Grande Canal, about 10 metres from the Rialto Bridge. The reception is only a few steps away from the Vaporetti (water bus) stop at Rialto and is nicely appointed. Reception staff wear gold-trimmed, crimson velvet tunics, white ruff collars and are multi-lingual. Dining-room staff and the bell staff are similarly attired in 'period' uniforms. Our room (131) was along a maze of pristine pink marbled corridors. The door to our room had gilded panels - an ornate theme echoed on the cream-painted Italian wooden bedroom furniture within. Beautiful pink pavilion-striped padded fabric wall coverings, matching water-marked silk bed-covers and canopy. Lovely Venetian glass mirror and chandelier. Shutters on the double-glazed windows. Immaculate house-keeping and efficient individual climate controls in each room. Breakfast was included in the tarrif we booked on-line (through GTA hotels) and comprised the usual hot and cold continental buffet, with fruit, croissants, ham, salami, cheeses, cereals, yoghurts, juices, coffee, eggs etc. The hotel is in the centre of everything with some beautiful restaurants nearby - ranging from expensive fish restaurants (like the Cafe Grande Canal across the bridge - two course dinner, with lobster was 200 Euros for 2 persons)to great little Trattorias (like the Aquilla Nera) up an alleyway from the Campo San Bortolomio Square behind the hotel where dinner was around 40 Euros. St Marks Square is clearly signposted and a 10 minute walk through the cobbled streets. The Campenile Bell Tower, Basilica Church and Doge's Palace are all there along with pigeons galore - to feed for 1 Euro a bag. Admissions to the Campanile, Doge's Palace and Basillica are extremely reasonable - between 6 to 15 Euros for adults. The hotel has great souvenir shops and stalls all around, selling local cheeses, silk ties, glass, carnival masks to sports shops and more keychains and fridge magnets than most other tourist traps. Gondolas go from outside the hotel - but haggle with the Gondolier - a 40 minute trip should be no more than 100 Euros - expensive - but a MUST DO in Venice for the first time. This is an excellent, 4 star hotel, with furnishings which exude the ambience of Venice. Well situated, clean and stylish - the ideal choice for the tourist visiting the sites of this wonderful city. We travelled with our 10 year old son who loved the city. All the restaurants - even the fanciest - will happily rustle up things not on the menu such as a margherita pizza or french fries for fussy little eaters and feeding the birds in St Marks Square always pleases kids. A great city for romantics, photographers, shopaholics, families and those who love art, architecture and history.
