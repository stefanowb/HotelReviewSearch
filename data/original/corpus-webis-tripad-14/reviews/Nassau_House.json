Going out of their way to be friendly yet not intrusive, they run this beautiful and impeccably clean B&B quitely and efficiently. Each day we found ourselves organizing our schedule around the daily social hour, anxious to come home, meet new guests and find out what they did that day. The wine was delicious. They serve two kinds, Cabernet and Chardonnay along with snacks. Sitting, swinging or rocking on the large front porch while sipping wine and talking to new friends in such a tropical setting felt wonderful. (I wish I were there right now) The breakfast is delicious. Freshly baked goods including blueberry crumbcake, nut breads, mufffins and the best key lime pie I've had to date. Not to mention yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, fruit salad, juice and coffee/tea. I loved the lagoon. We went in at night - very warm and romantic - and surprisingly private. The treetop suite was very spacious, two separate rooms. The first was the kitchen/dinette/ living room with armoire/TV, the second was the bedroom with another TV and bathroom. The location was great. Within walking distance are some great places not to be missed - PT's, Finnegan's Wake and Half Shell. Head downtown and don't pass up Two Friends for fresh and cheap clams and oysters on the half shell. Enjoy!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ChampagnePrincess", "date": "February 25, 2004", "id": 1670466}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best Little Guesthouse in Florida!!!", "text": "Well, well, well, where's a girl to start? Could it be with the fabuloso breakfasts? The wonderful treetop suite? The most accomodating hosts in the universe? All of the above and more made our stay at the Nassau House the TOP vacation we have ever taken. For three sisters of a \"certain age\" to never want to leave, you can be assured that this destination will live up to every fantasy you ever had about the tropics. Our new best friends Michael and Mark take hospitality to unheard of heights. We have resolved to make this February sojourn an annual event. LOVED IT!!!!

The owners, Michael and Mark, go out of their way to accommodate everyone's wishes for their stay and really bring the guests together! Homemade breakfast every morning is something I don't even do for myself at home! What a treat! And social hour was amazing. We met great people and sat outside by the pool or on the front porch watching people pass by just chatting it up! Before we knew it...it was dinnertime and we all had to part. I have to say my favorite experience of my Key West vacation was the conversations with such amazingly nice people! Have a question on where to go or what place had excellent dinners? Michael knew everything and we quickly trusted his experience and suggestions! He was right on the dot each and every time! The rooms were very nice. We stayed in the Double Down room and had so much room! It was huge and had it's own bathroom, which is a luxury for B&B's around my neck of the woods! What can I say...I wish I could stay there forever! This place was amazing; the room gorgeous, the owners extremely nice and helpful, the other guests spectacular, Ponder was the cutest thing ever...I could go on and on.", "user": "kseaman", "date": "February 22, 2004", "id": 1664293}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Absolutely Fabulous", "text": "This by far was the best B&B I've ever stayed in and I can't wait to go back!!", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 18, 2004", "id": 1659506}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Enjoyed Stay", "text": "Can't say enough good things about this, just sorry we didn't stay longer.
