The overall stay was very nice. I will begin with the negatives. There was a miscommunication as far as which room we were in. We paid to upgrade as did our friends who were in the Manor Building. We were placed in the Windsor Bldg and told we were being upgraded from our upgrade. When my husband went the room thre was luggage and a wedding dress on the bed. Obviously not our room. We were then sent to another room...got a phone call again wrong room. We were taken back down the to original room and a bell boy was picking up the luggage and dress this was suppossed to be our room. Got another call...appologizing for the mix up and telling us that this was an upgrade, with concierge service and the rooms were newer and more spacious. The room we had was Balmoral Honeymoon Grande Luxe Suite - HG. Secondly the food wasnt quite as expected. We have read and heard that Sandals food is superb and they have world renowned chefs. If you are eating at the buffets the food is typical all inclusive resort food, if you make reservations at the specialty restaurants or the other two order from the menu restaurants you will be pleased. There was an incident when we at at Baccarat and I ordered spinich/cheese stuffed tortilini with prawns and some sauce and the waiter said \"oh i forgot to tell you we are out of tortillini and we are substituting pene pasta.\" Not quite the same. Anyway, then one night at a bar we wanted vodka/cranberry juice and they were \"out of vodka\", another time ordered run and coke \"we are out of coke\", Again at a bar ordered frozen margarhitta...our blender is broken. (not another blender around...storage for extra appliances.?? go figure) It was little things like that daily, however we are pretty laid back so we just sort of laughed like you have got to be kidding. The beach was alright. I am a beach lover and the beach was at an incline and was not wide at all. One side of the beach was actually not usable most of the time we were there. THey brought in a barge with sand and and excavator to get the sand from the barge to the beach, bacically building it up. Not sure if this is something that happens frequently or its from a hurricane. The room was very nice, large, bed comfortable, toilet seperate from sink/closet area. Tub with shower was nice and big, water was plenty hot and we never ran out of hot water. Pools were very clean, beautiful, grounds were well kept, follage was beautiful. Sandals Cay, the island Sandals owns, is about a 5 minute boat ride from the mainland. You can make reservations for dinner at the restaurant or you can go out there for the day/a few hours etc. The restaurant is open for lunch as well. The food at dinner was great and the food at lunch was great. The lsland has lots of hammocks/lounges spread out so there is privacy. you can choose to lay in the shade or in the sun. The night life is typical all-inclusive. Sort of Cheesey but the staff is great. The piano bar/crystal bar were fun and the pub was great. They had karoke, bingo and other nightly themes. You can take a bus that stops right outside the hotel and will take you downtown where you can shop visit the strawmarket, and watch the cruise ships dock. The bus is either .50 per person or $1 per person. Its about a 10 minute ride when traffic is to a minimum. My husband went diving which he said was fabulous. They take you to two different locations total time lasting about 3-4 hours. The weather was good, not 100% sunny but it was still warm enough to lay in the pool or out on the beach and get a tan. We had a little rain usually early AM or at night. It did rain during the day but it was only short increments. We did learn that the gas and groceries are very expensive there. I believe that our taxi driver told us that Milk was $6 per gallon and gas at one point was $8 a gallon. Overall the stay was nice, the staff was nice and for the most part accommodating and we had a great time.", "title": "All you can eat & drink & all the fun you can handle", "user": "jntenor", "date": "December 22, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 121980914}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was our second stay at this resort and i have to say it was much better the first time (last year).

Additionally when a guest asks for a mask and snorkel to use on your private island, you would expect one to be provided. Unlike the response I received which was rude and disrespectful.

It was like its own little world. They have a boat to take you back and forth which comes and goes about every hour, so it was really easy to get there and back. The water was so clear, we were able to swim out just a little and see all kinds of fish. The resort had 8 different restaurants all of which were very good. The Baccarat was really good for breakfast and we really enjoyed Kimono's for dinner (hibachi style). The pizza place is superb for lunch or a snack. Most of the days, we stayed on the pretty beach. One day, we took the bus into the downtown area. We felt very safe the whole time and enjoyed shopping in the downtown area.
