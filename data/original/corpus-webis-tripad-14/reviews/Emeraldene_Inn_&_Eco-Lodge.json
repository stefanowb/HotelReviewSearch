This is a great place to stay outside the bustle of the main town, but so convenient for trips out and about. The weather was not setlled when we visited with floods in Brisbane and high winds, but that was only 2 days. The Lodge is very comfortable and well equipped. Rob and his Father Alan were so helpful and friendly, knowing just what a Brit would like to see and do. Both the gardens and the wildlife in it were lovely. The highlights of the visit must be the Humpback whale trip - don't miss it. Rob can do all the booking for you. We went on Spirit of Hervey Bay, a catamaran, great crew, very informative and top notch. You mustn't forget to catch the fruit bats flight out at sunset too. Maryborough, Bundaberg all worth a visit. No worries, ask Rob he knowns all the best places to go. Hervey Bay itself is delightful with excellent shopping, walks by the sea and safe swimming.
