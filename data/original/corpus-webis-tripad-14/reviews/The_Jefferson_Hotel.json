My dream finally came true and boy was I disappointed. The common areas and towels are fabulous and it ends there. Furnishings and bedding are poorly appointed and in need of an upgrade. The shower was one of the worst of my life. The shower head had two settings:skin piercing or drip with a temperature setting of luke warm or scalding. All options ended up with the oh so nice \"face spray\". On check in the toiletries had not been changed from the previous guest. I believe a 5 star rating should imply that all the rooms carry a high standard and the one I was in clearly did not live up to this expectation. I have stayed at the Berkeley Hotel in Richmond and had a nice shower and a comfortable sleep, for a similar price. The only bright spot is they are pet friendly. However, unless I bring my dog I will not stay at the Jefferson again.

We all were very impressed with our huge studio suite! It was clean, but there might have been one unnoticeable stain on the carpet that is nothing to be concerned about.

It was absolutely lovely. Upon arrival at The Jefferson we were greeted with a smile and very prompt service. This is an historic hotel and as such has features that some might think a bit odd. Not too many hotels feature a full sized statue of Thomas Jefferson in front of the check-in counter! It is obvious that the hotel had been built in stages and perhaps before the advent of elevators. It did take a bit of getting used to the different banks of elevators. But, after a few trips up and down we had the layout of the hotel down pat. Our room was quite spacious, the bed linens and window treatments were of the highest quality and in great condition. The towels were huge and thick! Throughout the hotel, the elaborate woodwork and decor was very well cared for. The pool area was delightful. Lovely teak deck chairs welcomed us with thick fluffy towels folded neatly as well as am immaculate changing rooms and pool area.", "title": "Lovely Hotel with old Virginia Charm", "user": "Nashna", "date": "February 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 24218244}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled on business", "text": "The wedding itself was amazing.

My son-in-law got a call from relatives who were dining at a restaurant and one of the party had a bad fall and needed extra bandages. My son-in-law asked the coincerge for the nearest drugstore and again was offered a ride in one of the Jefferson's Town Cars.
