Normally we stay at Hampton Inns but wanted to be in the Squaw Peak area and thus decided to stay here. Right from check-in we should have known what to expect. We arrived too early to check in but since we travel very often we knew it was possible to leave your baggage there until check-in. While initially the staff was rude, the gentleman FINALLY agreed to have us leave our luggage and said it would be in our rooms when we checked back in later. Of course it was NOT in the room and we were on the second floor and no elevator! We are in our 60s and this was NOT convenient for either my husband or me. Breakfast is boring with the same thing every day, not like Hampton Inns that vary the menu. The air conditioning did not function well, the water in the tub did not drain out so that when taking a shower you were up to your knees in water. When we arrived and I asked where one could go to check on e-mails, as had been advertised in their listing service available in the Business Center, they told me it was \"down\" and not expected to be up until Monday.........this was Sat. On Monday when I checked again I was told still not up until Tuesday. One couple standing at the desk when I asked that question and heard this, turned on their heal and left as this was a businessman who needed that service. VERY inconvenient. Still not up when we left on Wednesday. Maintenance is terrible......lot of evidence that the place has been \"let go\". Breakfast area is very small..........as is the pool.......and with a tendency to cater to kids' traveling sports teams, you are lucky to find a spot to sit. This is the second time we have encountered this with a Best Western and will never stay at one again. Hampton Inns much better.

We did our laundry here and took advantage of the vending machines each night for snacks. Too cold for the pool and hot tub, but we saw family's taking advantage, looked really neat & clean. Best of all, the breakfast off the lobby is worth your while not to skip! Eggs, toast, hash browns, make your own waffle station, yogurt, coffee, cereal, the works! For excellent coffee, drive one block into corporate area for specialty shops, gas, great chinese food and banks. Lobby has 3 computers with internet access (beware the firewalls that keep you from checking email, had to find Barnes and Noble to check mine, only drawback) and a nice fireplace, staff is very helpful and friendly.

NOTE: We traveled with a 2 year old and there was NO room for a crib/ playpen with the two queen beds. This proved problematic as she was in/out of bed!!! Therefore keep this in mind before you order two queens! GOOD: Free breakfast in AM - \"You make waffles\" yummy, lots of juice, cereal, and other goodies. Unfortunately the breakfast room was small and often cramped, as well you may have to wait for your turn at the waffle cooker. GOOD: Staff where polite and offered travel tips. GOOD: First Wed of month they have a free BBQ (Hamburgers) looked OK but we skipped it. NOT SO GOOD: Pool was not the cleanest - scum around edge of pool. Hot tub either bath tub temp. or too hot? Also pool is located around the parking lot...therefore not the most relaxing, private or scenic. NOT SO GOOD: no place to sit outside room. There is a little deck, and pool area but we had to stay close to our room when our daughter was sleeping.
