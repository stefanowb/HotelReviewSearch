The room overlooked a nice lawn area, although the we did see the back of the employee housing as well as a stored tent and some random equipment. It didn't obscure our view. The room was very comfortable, air conditioning worked well, and the nice front porch with two chairs was a nice touch. Now for the negatives- the check-in process was very efficient, but not too friendly, which surprised me. Another negative, and this is a pet peeve, is that half the hangers were of the type that you couldn't remove from the pole, so they must not trust their guests much. For a lodge of this reputation, calibre and cost, this was a ridiculous feature in their closet. Perhaps they should take a page out of a Best Western manual.

Where the food is spectacular and I've been a chef in a four star restaurant so trust me. Service was crisp, relaxed and extremely personal. Wait staffs' knowledge of the menu was spot on. All food and drink came at the right pace and presentation was beautiful. There were flowers on our food! From the Filet, to the Pork Tenderloin Chop w/home grown stone fruit sauce, salads and the most incredible blend of tastes from a carrot soup with chive olive oil and flower buds. The staff held our bill open while we went for a walk and played badminton to work up room for desert. All 4 deserts we choose were fabulous with the hot fudge sundae with meringue getting the best off, with strawberry shortcake and lemon chiffon cake a close second. Quick change into our suits and spent the last half hour of tub time before the kicked us out at 10:00PM. I set the alarm to wake up at 12:45 to be able to sit on our balcony and drink in the stars.
