This wonderful property has been re imagined to retain what is best and taking it up a notch. If you can go, you must! There is no other place you can go that has a more storied history. We had a nice big booth in the rear that overlooked the intire patio while giving us a feeling of privacy. The food is wonderful with many dishes being created table side. I do think the servers could be a little more personal, I know they are working and there every day, but for many this is a once in a lifetime experience. This is not to say service is bad, hardly, but a little more upbeat service would only add to the wonerful ambiance of this magical restaurant.
