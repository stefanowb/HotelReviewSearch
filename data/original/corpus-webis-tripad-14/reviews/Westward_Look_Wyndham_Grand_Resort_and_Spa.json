The front desk readily acknowledged that the beds were too soft for \u201csome tastes\u201d but that there was no solution until the rooms were renovated. We repeatedly requested to speak to a manager, but the manager Alan Klein was never available, even when asked for by name. Much insistence finally brought the engineering department around to putting boards between the box spring and the mattress, but we ended up sleeping on the floor on cot mattresses as the beds were still too soft and worn out in the center. This is really a scandal for a resort charging $391 per night. Please do not believe the standard corporate reply that Westward Look will post in reply to this decidedly mixed review which blames everything on the on-going renovation: while some small part of the resort is being renovated, none of our complaints were related to renovation issue, as beds can be replaced anytime.
