The rooms are very small and have some kind of strange smell. The location is very bad. The highway is on one side and the other side has a very busy road. If you need to get to the subway, you should wait for their shuttle. If you miss it or there are a lot of people waiting for it, you will be standing there for another 30-40 minutes. There is only one restaurant around this hotel (you can just walk there). Everything else is far away. The front desk people have some attitude that makes you feel that you have to be thankful that you're staying there. Sometimes they can also be very rude.

The hallways are well worn. This is one step up from an old motel. The room however was clean and well decorated, but small. Furniture and wall paper were nice. The rug was clean, but worn. The bathroom sink had cigarette burns even though the room was billed as a non-smoking room. Wall paper over the shower was pealing. The room was pricey given these facts and also the fact that it's kind of in the middle of nowhere. It's a short drive to Boston so it's an OK location. I wouldn't stay here again for the price I paid, but if you are looking for somewhere to stay on your way to another location or because you are visiting someone nearby, it's better than a motel.

Although they had several shuttle vehicles of varying sizes, they never were able to accommodate all of the people who were ready to be transported, especially on the return trip.

Calls to the hotel manager were answered with reports that the manager was not on the property.
