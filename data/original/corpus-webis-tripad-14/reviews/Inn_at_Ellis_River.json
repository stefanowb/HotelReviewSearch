From start to finish a memorable experience. This inn is everything it claims to be and more. We have stayed at a few B&B's but none compare to the service, impeccable cleanliness, and meticulous attention to detail received here. We were offered assistance with our bags at check in. Breakfast had a reserved seating time so you could be personally served (by the owner and staff) and offered a choice of two hot delicious items that were prepared fresh upon ordering. Frank and his wife apologized to us for not being at the desk when we checked in to personally greet us. The owners and the staff went out of their way to anticipate and fulfill all needs and ensure a wonderful stay. You could write paragraphs regarding the inn and the service received. Quiet, relaxation, beautiful surroundings, walking proximity to a fine restaurant, fun staff, heated pool, hot tub to soak in after a long day's hike, and wonderfully appointed rooms with comfortable beds make this a Must Return.
