We were warmly greeted at the reception desk. I asked for a room with a view of the golf course but they can only do this by getting an upgrade at a cost of \u00a315 extra. I thought it will be worth it. After finishing our first round of golf we picked up the key from the reception. What a big disappointment because the room was like a box room in the corner of the building looking out mostly to one side of the building and with just a glimpse of the golf course. The one tiny window I could only see out if I stand on a stool. I am 5'2. I just couldn't stay a night in this room, Instantly I felt very claustrophobic. And so we complained to the reception. She's a lovely girl, she changed our room to, take note: Room 201. Whooaaa.....what a room!!!! with a view to the whole golf course just few yards to the 18th and 9th greens and just below the balcony is the putting practice green. The room has king sized bed (2 singles put together), the bath and shower room spotless with some toiletries, there's a fridge with free bottled water (very thoughtful), a little box of chocolates (nice touch), modern flat screen television, iron and ironing board, safe, hairdryer etc. We found that there was only one robe and pair of slippers in the room so we rang the reception again. No problem. 5 minutes later another robe and pair of slippers was sent to our room. After admiring the views around and just settling in I searched all over the room to find the television remote control so I can check the following day's weather forecast. The previous guest must have packed away the tv remote by accident. It was getting embarrassing phoning the reception; the girl must think we are such a pair of nuisance. Another five minutes and the tv remote was sent to our room. I rate the reception desk 's service 10/10.", "user": "TeessideMadgolfer", "date": "March 10, 2011", "id": 99713279}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "another great stay", "text": "At the restaurant although there weren't much choice in their menu I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of service and the quality of the dish I ordered and the drinks was very reasonably priced, much cheaper than most 3 star rated hotel I stayed in the pasts (has there been a mistake? I wonder). The breakfast is excellent; fresh fruit salad bar, different cereals and yoghurt, freshly squeezed orange juice and they serve fresh mushrooms (not the tinned ones other 4 star rated hotel serve) I would rate the restaurant 8/10 only because of the limited choice in their evening menu but the service is once again excellent.", "user": "mich54321", "date": "March 1, 2011", "id": 98601092}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic hotel in Fromby", "text": "The golf course: For the time of the year (1st week of March) after a bad winter, lots of rain and hard frosts the greens a running very true and lightning fast. The course must have an A1 standard drainage system because it's very dry like in summer condition. Lots of pot bunkers but you should have no problem if you know how to avoid them!! Lots of big lakes dotted around the course which make the game very interesting and challenging. Altogether the course is very immaculate and of excellent standard. One thing I would like to see when I come back next time is a course marshall and a starter like they do in most championship courses. My home course is also a championship course and is longer than Formby. It takes me and a playing partner 3.15 hours the most to finish a round. And here at Formby for the first time in my golfing life a round took us 5.30 hours!!! (4.30 hours the previous day).Totally ridiculous and unacceptable. 4 ball hackers are stupidly oblivious or pretending to be ignorant, just do not want to let through a 2 ball and the rest of the golfers behind (3 groups waiting on the same tee on several tees) obviously got so annoyed and frustrated. This shouldn't happen if there is a marshall sorting out the hopeless, thoughtless and selfish hackers. This complaint is of course nothing to do with the hotel but should be given attention by the golf director if to encourage golfing visitors to return. I thought we will have almost 2 hours spare to rest and have a drink on the 19th but all we both want is to quickly get away.
