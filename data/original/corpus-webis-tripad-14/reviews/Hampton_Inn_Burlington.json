The next day after being gone all day and returning to the room, there were 6 extra pods! Thanks! Our room was clean and spacious. We used the pull out bed in the sofa and it wasn't that bad. They have fresh cookies in the lobby at 8:30 each night which is a nice touch. Breakfast was pretty good with a variety of waffles, an egg dish, meat fresh fruit, fresh oatmeal with your choice of toppings and cereal. They have done some recent renovations and the lobby is beautiful and furniture in the room was new. The air and heat were older but worked fine. High speed internet worked great. The restaurant next door had a \"temporarily closed\" sign on it so I can't comment on that. My complaint..... Price gouging. We were told that since they were almost full, we couldn't use any discounts. We are Hilton Honors members as well as AARP. We were charged $235 the first night and then the price went up to $259 for Friday and Saturday. I saw a bunch of people checking out on Saturday morning so asked if we could use our member discount. I was told they were fully booked for that night ( I later saw the cleaning staff cleaning a room at 9 that same night). The desk clerk said she could give me 10% off making it $249. I asked if she could at least match the first night's rate, which she did. This was a nice place but we felt taken advantage of. Don't go here during a famine!

Towels are provided free of charge so no need to bring yours from home. The hotel is situated a 10 min drive from downtown Burlington easy and convinient. Do take advantage of the free 2 hr parking at public parking area (pick up a map from the lobby for locations). Close to factory outlets in Essex Junction and a 20min drive to Ben and Jerry factory.

For the past decade, I have traveled on business to Burlington 4 - 5 times a year. I've stayed at hotels downtown, near the airport (avoid ALL of them at the airport/mall) and in Colchester. This was only my second time staying at this Hampton Inn. I'm comfortable saying that I won't stay anywhere else from now on. We had originally booked our stay at the Residence Inn. I wanted more space for my family to spread out and thought it would be the perfect fit. After checking into the Residence Inn, we (she) decided that we were going to look for a less expensive alternative. We (she) booked the rest of our vacation at the Hampton Inn, Colchester and in the end, I'm thrilled we did. The hotel's lobby and rooms have all been recently remodeled. The hotel was spotlessly clean and well cared for. It is an older hotel with a modern feel. The part that blew me away and will keep me coming back was the staff. It wasn't one specific person, but every one of them made us feel special. The hotel has 200 rooms and yet the employees all treated us like we were family. An older gentleman at the front desk and his manager went out of their way to help my wife plan our itinerary...\"go here, not there, eat here and avoid that place\". They were spot on with all their recommendations, saved us money and ensured that we had a great vacation. My kids LOVED the pool, breakfast and cookies each night.
