We followed the rocky path to the pool and it was very nice BUT only 8 sun loungers. Oh dear. What would we do, we have 2 boys of 9 and 6 they would want to go swimming. Maybe things would get better. We went to investigate our lodge. Oh dear! 2 of the sinks were badly craked , the huge decking area neede repair. Backin the car and back to reception. They gave us keys to the lodge next door. Still cracked sinks. when we complained again and mentioned the lack of loungers at the pool we were advised we could aslways go to the beach 1/2 hour away. Not likely. They did move us to a lodge with a private pool which was ok. This is not luxurious accomodation. The game drives were great and we saw loads of animals .
