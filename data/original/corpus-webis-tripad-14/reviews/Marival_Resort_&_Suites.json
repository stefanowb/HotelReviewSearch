I had remembered this from our last stay in Mexico and politely said \"no thank you\" but of course that wasn't enough. I had to be a little rude and actually walk away from the person in mid sentence. Once we found our transportation to the resort, it started to get a little better, but wouldn't you know it, upon checking in we discovered that the ocean view 1 bedroom suite we requested was not available and after checking to see if there were any 2 bedrooms available we were given building #9 (with a view of the put-put golf course and children\u2019s club). I was alright with that after such a long flight, all I wanted to do was get my suit on and get to the pool, but then we were assigned a person that was going to tell us a little bout the resort and how to get around, make dinner reservations, where to find the desk for excursions, etc., we were again bombarded with the talk for time shares and how we could have a free something if we gave them 90 mins of our vacations time. I politely agreed thinking we could do the jungle tour for free and still do a few more later in the week, at our own expense. We sat for the timeshare talk and before anything was said I told the guy that I had sat thru one before but didn't appreciate being pushed or pressured, he agreed and said this was not going to go like that . . . He lied! We were almost done until his boss decided to join and almost go over the whole thing again, when I told him this all sounded good but that we weren't interested but would think about it for sometime in the future (as my husband and I have talked about getting a place) he wouldn't talk no for an answer. I finally had to get up and walk out, leaving my husband to explain my dislike for being pressured into spending our money and time. Our 19 and 6 year old kids were waiting in the room to begin their vacation, and their parents were spending it having their arms twisted. After that unpleasant 2 hour battle, we finally began our vacation. Back at our room, I found that sitting on our balcony wasn\u2019t going to be the pleasant experience I envisioned, as there was a nest of birds who took offense to me sitting there and chose to dive bomb us until we went inside. After calling the front desk to complain, they sent someone to take care of it. I felt a little bad, because they had to knock it down \u2013 but hey, I paid good money to have a balcony I could use so I got over my guilt. Of course the birds wouldn\u2019t let me forgot because for the next two days, they acted like the nest was still there and terrorized us by making fly bys at us.

Getting a lounge chair was pretty easy, just get up early - around 0830 -0900 and place your towels in the chairs. I would recommend that you bring our own, as if someone takes one of the hotel pool towel, you don't get your pool card back and are charged $25.00 for losing it, which leaves you to think about taking someone else\u2019s and that creates a domino effect (as that happened to my brother in law, whose towel was taken).

It was kind of nice to have people bringing you pina coladas even when you're on the beach. I'd avoid the pools since they have swim up bars where a bunch of people just hang out and drink all day - they're too lazy to find a bathroom and I'm sure that's why my skin always itched when I went in the pool.

The view was breathtaking and we watched the sun set every evening on the beach. Our kids had a great time boogie boarding in the rougher afternoon waves. The food at the buffet Casa Bella was just okay, so we didn't eat there often. The 3 restaurants that required dinner reservations were excellent, and very accommodating to our sometimes picky eaters. All the dinners we had were very good with excellent service, Bella Vista was our favorite. For lunches we usually ate at the snack bar areas and didn't have any complaints. LaPergola was also available for breakfast and lunch without reservations and had better food than the buffet or snack bars. The drinks were great and served with a smile at the restaurants or pool bars. All in all, we had a great family vacation and would stay at the Marival again. I was a bit worried about all the negative reviews I had read, but remember this is Mexico and things will not be like they are at home, isn't this the reason we go on vacation!
