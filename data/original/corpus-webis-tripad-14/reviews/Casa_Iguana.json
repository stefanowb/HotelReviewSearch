This is the place. Getting there was an adventure as missed the official panga boat trip to get to Little Corn Island (our plane was late). Ended hiring someone who took us across the ocean in his little boat - an exhilarating and thrilling experience (potentially a stupid decision). Upon arriving at Casa Iguana, we were shown to our cabin with a front porch facing the ocean with hammocks and chairs, own private bathrooms, outdoor shower and comfy bed with mosquito net. The grounds at Casa Iguana were beautifully kept, and the meals were amazing. The chef was trained at the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) ..... we unexpectedly enjoyed a new delicious cake every night. The staff were over the top helpful and friendly. Very communal and friendly lodgings - where we played games, drank Flor de Cana (Nicaraguan rum - awesome, delicious stuff) and hung out in the evenings. Day time was spent on the beach, swimming, laying around, reading in hammocks and exploring the island. The island is small (no roads - pure jungle).", "title": "Relaxation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "bbjj0827", "date": "August 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 36489581}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The only place to stay on Little Corn", "text": "We loved it and are considering going back.

Inexperienced and uncaring management completely spoil the beautiful location Casa Iguana has on Little Corn Island. The management along with the \"interns\", dive staff and other gringo hangers-on that treat Casa Iguana like their personal social club make the place unpleasant for guests. When we arrived our casita had absolutely no water. We notified someone at the lodge, a couple hours went by we again notified someone. Kelly stopped by our casita and her solution was to tell us if we wanted to shower to use another shower. We were paying $65 a night for a private bathroom and shower (both unusable without water.) After telling her that if we weren't going to get what we were paying for then we wouldn't be paying $65 a night, only then did she actually put any effort into finding out what the problem was...and it was a simple fix. Our casita obviously had not even simple maintanence done in a very long time. We had to close the screen doors by putting chairs in front of them because all the eye/hook closures were missing. When we asked Mgmt if they had any eye/hook closures we were told with a laugh that they hadn't any of those in a long time. And certainly they didn't show the initiative to use a plyers to bend a nail over as a temp fix. Both our mosquito net and screens had holes in them so mosquitos were a big problem in our casita. At Casa Iguana if you have any complaint you get the response \"this isn't a resort\" this is \"rustic.\" Well my husband and I travel quite a bit and at Casa Iguana \"rustic\" translates into \"we don't give a dam\" and the place ends up feeling like a money grab. The Mgmt is so non-existent that we were told by many people staying at the 3 other places down the beach that they walk into the CI lodge all-day-long and fill bottles with water and coffee for free. Several told us they even got free breakfast...it seemed to be well known to do this. There is no \"adult supervision\" at Casa Iguana and it is truly a waste of a fantastic location...maybe this would be acceptable at $25 a night but absolutely not at $65/75.", "title": "Big Disappointment!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Vivica", "date": "February 6, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 24322454, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location.", "disliked": "\u2014 The inexperienced, arrogant and rude management and staff."}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Casa Iguana for 3 nights in December/January\u2026over the New Year\u2019s holiday.

It was so hot out anyway, a luke-warm shower was truly refreshing. Of course, our room did have some \"amenities\" included, free of charge, that were maybe not so ideal. We saw several giant roaches and some little lizard friends on our walls, but they were harmless...just kind of icky. I only mention it because I realize some people would not be able to handle being that up close and personal with nature, but considering you're in the middle of a jungle, it's to be expected.

I can't really fault Casa Iguana for this anyway, because the service we experienced everywhere on the island was typically slow and perhaps not so friendly as one might be accustomed to in the United States, but it was just something you had to roll with.

While it wasn't that far and we aren't thaaat lazy, we were thankful we didn't have to make that trek every time we wanted to grab a mojito down at Habana Libre. Furthermore, we got lost on the way back while cutting across the island on a series of little paths. We wound up in an area of sketchy little huts that made us a bit nervous, and while I'm sure we would have been fine, we erred on the side of caution and retreated to the beach.
