I was originally booked into the Hermitage in Monaco, a super luxury Belle-Epoque hotel, then thought the better of the cost! I chose the Goldstar Resort & Suites instead because for a fraction of the amount I could stay in a suite (a proper one with a seperate lounge) instead of a small room, and with its central location a 5-6 minute walk from the train station, I could catch a train to Moncaco (20 mins) with ease. The hotel has a small pool and gym which cover the essentials and although it doesn't have a sophisticated concierge like my original choice, I'd done my homework about restaurants and the receptionist helped me to book them when asked. The breakfast was small but perfectly formed - at Euros 20 it was quite expensive by UK standards but this is normal for hotels in France. A previous reviewer complained about the croissants - I thought they were fantastic. There are plenty of cheap breakfast places on the nearby seafront for variation and there's always the kitchenette in the room to store croissants etc if you're really trying to save some money. The lounge area was a very good size and the decor of the rooms is modern and stylish. All in all this is an excellent value, stylish hotel (the pictures on the website are a good representation) in a great location and I would definately recommend it. Those who prefer vast American buffet breakfasts, VIP concierge services, deluxe spas and 20 English language channels on the TV should stay at one the of the grand 5 star hotels instead, and pay more for a smaller room.", "title": "Really enjoyed my stay at Goldstar Resort", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "alicethetravelagent", "date": "October 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20560651, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great value and nicely decorated suites", "disliked": "\u2014 A few random wooden Toucans which did not go with the rest of the great decor!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I picked this hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. Some pluses about the hotel: (1) great layout. there's pocket doors between the entrance and living room, and between the living room and bedroom, so that you can close off the rooms. this was convenient when i stayed behind at night with our 18 month daughter and my husband strolled around the neighborhood. (2) the people at the reception speak excellent english and extremely helpful. Some minuses: (1) we got a room on the 3rd floor (there are 6 floors). even though the windows are double-pane, we could still hear the cars and motorbikes on the road. probably staying on the higher floor will help. (2) the walls are not well insulated so you can hear your neighbor walking. this is probably typical of any new construction so I can't blame the hotel. (3) our bathroom (the tub) had some mold. it wasn't a whole lot, but enough to bother me. again, probably something you will find in any hotel. Although I'm not sure I would stay here the next time, overall, I would recommend this hotel - especially for families since you can have some privacy.
