I booked online and made a copy of my reservation. A non-smoking, double queen room. I give my confirmation # to the girl at the front desk and she looks and looks and looks and says...gee, I see your reservation but you're already checked in! OH REALLY? I'm standing in front of you, 20 mins after the earliest time you can check in, and she already has me checked in? Well, she has NO idea how this happened or WHO is in my room...turns out after lying to my face for over half hour and she indeed checked some \"regular\" into my room, used MY booking information INCLUDING CREDIT CARD. Imagine she checks someone into a room with no ID or credit card on file and then lies consistently about it. I kept asking her who checked her in..I don't know...I don't know...she then goes to check to see if someone is actually in the room. while she is gone another employee told us our credit card was linked to the room with a stranger in it and that the girl who \"didn't know anything\" was the only person working the front desk all day. the girl returns to tell us someone is indeed in our room and to make up for her mistake, she offers to upgrade me to a non smoking double queen room because she said we had a king room reserved..I said to her LOOK at the reservation! you're upgrading me to a room I had reserved already.. maybe the \"regular\" had reserved a king room, i certainly didn't. She then offers to adjust the price so I decide to take her offer and when I get to the room, it reeked of cigarette smoke so badly, that was the last straw. I went and said forget it, I want my money back. NEVER in my life have I encountered such scam artists and liars such as this bunch. I would play double not to stay in a dump like this. Bad enough you have a front desk clerk lying about everything she did, you have a hotel manager defending her lies and security breaches. Needless to say, I cancelled my credit card the second I left this dump. There are plenty of hotels in Albany..find another that doesn't try to steal your personal info and share it with their \"daytime\" regulars....", "title": "Okay for One Night", "user": "TravellerGal", "date": "April 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 127684630}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled on business", "text": "We booked the Days Inn very last minute via Priceline as a stopover on our road trip to Boston from Toronto.", "title": "DECENT VALUE", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LIGINI", "date": "March 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 126804455}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled on business", "text": "The best things I can say about this property are that it is clean, and that it's right next to a Dunkin' Donuts.
