When we checked in, the lobby was very beautiful and clean. We had a room on the fifth floor and had a great parking spot in the parking garage on the second floor. The parking garage elevators go directly to the room floors. There are no tunnels or corridors, just a simple elevator stop! We went into the two adjoining rooms on the fifth floor. There were in-door \"gardens\" on a few of the floors. The rooms were very beautiful and had large bathrooms and beds. The beds were the most comfortable of the four hotels we have stayed in during our vacation. Each television had the ability to buy movies and connect video game consoles to them. The lobby had a fountain and a huge chandelier. Another fountain was surrounded in brass or copper sculptures depicting the Lewis and Clark expedition. The hotel had two restaurants attached to it. One was a moderate bar and grill. The other was a more expensive steak house. The ONLY complaints I were the fact that you must use a key card to call an elevator on the first floor and the pool. The small pool that was on the eighth floor was very murky and green. You could not see the bottom of the pool at the three foot mark. I suggest that this hotel is very great for business men/women, travelers, and families, as long as you don't want to swim! The breakfast buffet was great. The free 1 hour long distance, unlimited local calling and free internet were truly appreciated. Highly recommend this place, and suspect the pool murkiness will be remedied soon.

It was our first trip to St Louis in many, many years, and the first stay downtown. It was a nice and clean king-size bed room with a very fancy marble bath. The water closet was separate from the sink/mirror and the closet was adequate. We paid just a little more for a Gateway Arch view room (540), and it was magnificent - especially at night. Facing the Arch is a bit noisy with traffic most of the night, as it faces an interstate corridor, at least down on the 5th floor where we were, so if you're a light sleeper ...(?), but we we slept fine. The afternoon complimentary snacks/refreshments and breakfast were a big plus, too...not gourmet, but adequate. Parking was $10/day and you are supposed to be out of the parking garage at check-out time. However, we were still sight-seeing until late afternoon and they said we could stay parked in the garage until we left (the front desk had to \"buzz us through\" to the elevator when we were finally ready to leave town). This is arguably the closest hotel to the Gateway Arch (Adams Mark and Millennium Hotel are nearby, too). Of course, it's location, location, location. This hotel is very near Busch Stadium (going to a foot/base ball game or just to tour) and the Gateway Arch/riverfront (and other downtown attractions/museums). The hotel is so close to all of these, that you couldn't drive there quicker than you could walk. We would definitely stay here again to be near the downtown St Louis attractions.

Anyway......my family already loves Drury Inns, but the ones we have been to have all been kind of run down and old. We keep coming back to Drury because of their great hot breakfast and their cocktail hour in the evenings with free snacks. This Drury Plaza was more than a pleasant surprise. The inside lobby is huge and quite nice for a Drury. The late afternoon we checked in, the lobby was active with Chiefs fans and the staff who had to look after all of the Kansas City visitors seemed quite in control. The front desk was efficient and trained well. The cocktail hour was already going on and the whole lobby just oozed of spirit and fun! Our room was more than adequate. No complaints there. The parking situation is the only downfall, but most all of the downtown hotels have the same problem. Parking was FREE and at least the Drury allowed us to keep our car parked in their lots while we were at the game. We were only about 6 or 7 blocks from Edward Jones Dome...and easy walk. There is a Drury right next door to the stadium, but they had been booked for weeks because of this rival game.
