First the Good: The accommodations at the camp are first rate nothing less. You will rest with the wonderful sounds of the Ocean in your ears and by the end of your stay, in your heart. Alvaro's wife/staff and happy dog one and two (two of the most super fun always happy pups you will ever have viewed) are golden gems and will cook some of the best food and treats you have ever had in your life. Truly wonderful down to earth people. So what then is the problem? Well, I know that Alvaro is a nice person (I think) and I know he loves animals and can surf like the devil himself, yet can he teach? I came here knowing nothing about surfing and left a week later feeling that I hate surfing. Thank God I have friends who have shown me the wonderful fun you can have on a board. My main problem with Alvaro is, \"HE DOES NOT TALK.\" You will be lucky if he says more then two words to you a day, not my way of learning how to do anything. I think if I would have gone with a group rather then by myself, or if I would have already knew a little about surfing, I would have had a much better time. So with that in mind I can't recommend this place for anything other then an advanced surfer, or maybe a group of people who will as a group be able to enjoy the wonderful land of Costa Rica. By the way you should know that the camp is about a 40 min walk (which you would never do) or a 10 min cap ride (which is only about $3) from the town of Joco. The town is a surf town nothing more nothing less. Watch you stuff and yourself at night as you would anywhere. I will surf again this time with my friends in Maui. So bottom line, a poor introduction to surfing, but was lucky to get over it and if I could do it over I would not go to Alvaro again for my first instruction to the greatest feeling in the world.

( as well as the various animals running around the camp) My only problem comes with the teaching. I came here knowing nothing about how to surf, and made that very clear on my booking. I am in great physical shape, yet the instruction by Alvaro Solano is just not there. He is a very nice guy who loves animals and his family and can also surf like the devil himself, yet he just does not talk, you will be lucky if he says two words to you the whole day. Maybe its me with my 6'2 / 230lbs New York City accent, but I need to be told/taught how to surf.

Each of the bungalows has two individual rooms with private baths, air conditioning, two single beds or one queen-sized bed and large porches. The porches are ideal for relaxing in hammocks and watching the sun rise and set over the Pacific Ocean. Our bungalows are equipped with small safes for the storage of valuables. However, our rooms do not have TVs, telephones or Internet connections, enabling our guests to leave the daily stresses of home behind and to enjoy the Pura Vida of Costa Rica."}
