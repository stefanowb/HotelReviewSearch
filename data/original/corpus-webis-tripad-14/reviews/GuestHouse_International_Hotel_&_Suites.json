I had stayed at the property years ago, and it was a good experience. Prior to their arrival I called the hotel several times, went by the property three times, and was shown several rooms. I upgraded the room, and the week of the wedding phoned and again went by to insure that my family was given a nice, clean room. The day they arrived was hectic, and although the room was dirty--soiled carpet, run-down, mold and mildew in the tub/shower, etc--they chose to stay rather than move to another hotel. The fees included breakfast, but when they arrived at the breakfast room the next morning--Wedding Day--the beverage dispenser was broken, only muffins were offered, and they were told that \"we are waiting for the truck to arrive with breakfast.\" Oops. No breakfast, and a long day to come... After the wedding I checked out the room my family was given and spoke to the manager and the desk clerk. The room they were given was NOT the one I had booked! I was told that there were two other rooms, and that they could move to a different room. Upon inspection, the rooms were all dirty, with soiled carpet, mold and mildew in the bathrooms/shower enclosures, and generally run down--peeling paint, poor caulking, pretty nasty. Kitchenette was small, dirty, and uninviting. Dinette was missing two chairs. All in all, a very poor experience in spite of my efforts. I would have moved them to another hotel nearby but all similar hotel rooms were booked AND the hotel would not refund our money... DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WISH A CLEAN, QUIET LOCATION or if you want breakfast... I later learned that although they had a smoking room several people stood outside their door or nearby and smoked, and the smoke from those \"guests\" other nearby smoking rooms was disgusting.", "title": "Worst experience in the last decade!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Donald I", "date": "October 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 142919024}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed four nights at this hotel and the good news isthere was no bugs.

It was late in the evening and we thought that just one night wouldn't hurt us. We were pleasantly surprised. The new management has cleaned and refurbished the rooms. The bathrooms had new tile and fixtures - they look like they were done within the last year. They were nothing special, but they were cleaned each day, and were clean - not just a 'lick and a promise.' The pool was clean, the hot tub - not so clean the day we arrived, but cleaned before we left. The rooms were quiet, the beds comfortable, the staff helpful. It's a budget place to stay, but overall a good value. It's conveniently located to Upland and San Antonio hospital. There was a bike tour the first weekend we were there, but at night it was quiet.

Upon entering the neat and spacious reception area we thought that we made a good decision in choosing this hotel for our 2 night stay....We Were Wrong. We entered the room which was dated to say the least...then we checked the bathroom and that was a mess!! Unfortunately due to the hour of the night we just decided to tough it out. The next day we debated on finding another hotel and since neither of us were familiar with the area we sadly chose to stick it out. When we returned, we came back to a room that was completely untouched! Housekeeping entered the room but never so much as emptied a trash can. I called the front desk to get the matter resolved but I got nothing but excuses - \"If there are bags on the bed they won't make the bed.\" So when there are 2 beds and only one has bags on it because it wasn't slept in the housekeeping person just takes a peek and moves on to the next room (allegedly)? Their remedy was to send a guy to our room who said, \"What do you want?\"... I said to him, \"A room that has been serviced.\" He then left and returned with a trash bag containing towels (I won't say they were clean because a hand towel had some type of stain on it), toilet paper, and some basic toiletries. Never once did an employee provide an apology or provide an ounce of customer service. If You Stay At This Hotel... You Will Regret It.... We Sure Did!!!
