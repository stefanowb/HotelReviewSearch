The public areas are clean and well kept, as are the rooms. If you want a quiet room ask for the 'short' wing which only has two rooms. We did this but forfeited the chance of a room with a view. The room was quite small but well presented ( although the TV was on the side wall- giving me a crick in the neck)The Manhattan bar in the lobby was closed throughout our stay, with no explanation but this is not a problem as there plently of bars and restaurants in the area. The attached carpark has very small bays and two way traffic, so be aware that this may be an issue. best to leave your car there and use buses and taxis as the hotel advises.
