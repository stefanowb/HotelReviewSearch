We wanted to watch her squad perform on the last day, but we did not make a reservation ahead of time since we were unsure of our schedule and arrival time. Because we arrived in Cincinnati earlier in the day than anticipated, we took a gamble and went to Great Wolf Lodge first to see if we could get a nice room at a reasonable rate. At the front desk Laura happily assisted my husband and gave us a wonderful deal. We were thrilled with our King Whirlpool Suite! The room and halls were immaculate. We ate in both restaurants, one for dinner and one for breakfast, and we were both very happy with each meal. At night we were able to step outside on our patio and watch the fireworks from Kings Island. Although we didn't use the waterpark, we had a great time seeing our daughter perform the next day. Our only tiny concerns were the speed of the internet (but it was free, so who can complain?) and the stomping and running of excited children on the floor above us, but again, it's a place for kids. so who can complain?

I asked if they had bed bugs and was told that \"these\" bugs looked like ticks, not bed bugs??? Which, after research, I have found that one stage of the bed bug does slightly resemble a tick. They sent up security and the two men collected three or four more bugs. I wanted to leave, but was told that they didn't have any other rooms available. I spent the rest of the night sleeping in the desk chair and hoped that my 5 month old, three year old, and husband were not surrounded by bugs in the kid cabin. We also collected a bug to bring home to have tested ourselves if needed. We were told that they weren't sure what these were... After reading other reveiws on here, it sounds like they have seen bed bugs a lot in this hotel! They next morning we spoke to the manager, who told us that they would send in a third party to check the room out. We asked for a refund, since we didn't spend $300 a night to spend it with bed bugs!!! He told us that we would have to wait and they would get back to us. It's been close to 48 hours since we checked out and still haven't heard from the hotel. My husband has been trying to contact the manager, but hasn't had much luck thus far. We were given garbage bags for our clothes and they offered us $20 to wash our clothes there...no thanks!!!

Every year I look at GWL but feel it is over priced and our two girls dont need all the bells and whistles to have a good time, they love the pool at the Candlelight hotel were we usually go. I had signed up for the GWL email at the start of the year and I received an email in april about a pre summer sale. If you booked early for July they had rooms as low as 169.00 a night, that is an amazing price for GWL so we decided to book and stay the 2 nights and then just drive up to our other hotel and stay the remander of the week. It was the best holiday ever and it was just the right amount of time to spend at GWL. When we checked in at noon on the sunday our room was ready, its was on the top floor with a balcony overlooking the outdoor pool and mini golf. We went straight to the pool after checking in, it was nice to be able to sit outside in the sun and the girls could go inside do a waterslide on their own and you knew they were safe, there are lifeguards all over the place. Our girls are also 9 and 12 so they are fine on their own. They had a great time on the waterslides and just checking the place out. We had dinner at the buffet that night and the food was pretty good, as what is expected at a buffet. The mini golf is alot of fun, its interactive so there is never a dull moment. It was $30 for the 4 of us to play but they after that it is half price with your receipt showen. The next morning we had breakfast at the same restaurant and it was very good, but we always find on holidays breakfast is our best meal. Lunch was around the pool. That night we decided to just do the pizza hut express and eat in our room. Alot of kids were at storytime but our girls were a little old for that. The next day we found our spot at the pool, checked out at 11 and stayed until 5. Then we just drove up the hill to our other hotel so we didnt have the 3 hour drive home, which was nice since we were tired from a day of waterslides. If you add the cost of 3 days of a waterpark into the hotel price we got an amazing deal. When we checked out it was 500 for the 3 days, that was all our meals, tips and minigolf. Very reasonable.
