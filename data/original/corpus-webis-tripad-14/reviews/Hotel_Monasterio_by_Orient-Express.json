The dinner we had at the restaraunt at the hotel was very romantic with candles and beautiful views of the city. There is no spa at the hotel but you can have a massage either in your room or in their small massage room. The massage was OK, nothing special. The one thing that I didn't like about our room is that instead of double bed for me and my husband, we had two single beds next to each other. It was very uncomfortable at night to say the least. I kept falling into the small space between the two beds and by the end of the night my back and neck were totally sore.

The last two reviewers have pretty much summed up the experience you will encounter there. You may think it borders on petty but when the cost of the room can be at the very least $385 US to over $500US a night the expectation gets higher. After 3 nights there, and several problems I was relieved to leave and the place started giving me the creeps. We also had problems with the overheated rooms that they could do nothing about except bring fans in and we are also charged $30 USD extra a night to have an oxygenated room although we quickly realized that in our room it was an impossibility. They were gracious enough to take the charge off the bill. We thought we were the only ones complaining and then ran into two other couples in the lobby that were having their rooms switched.

It is a stunning converted monastery set around two cloistered courtyards. The chapel is a microcosm of the splendor of many of the churches that are abundant in Cusco. The hotel is situated a short walk from the main square, although the effects of altitude make a short walk seem like a small hike! With the exceptions below, service was very high, especially in moments of crisis, such as calling the local doctor to the hotel. In terms of the rooms, there are dangers in generalizing from the specific, nevertheless. The rooms are very small even by UK hotel standards and miniscule by US. A number of the rooms have oxygen enrichment systems, others air conditioning, some both and others neither. There are rooms with oxygen enrichment and no air conditioning. Avoid these in all circumstances. Ask to move rooms as the benefit of the oxygen enrichment can only be appreciated by the windows being closed. Our room temperature was in excess of 27 degrees at night and hotter during the day making any relaxation/rest time in the room impossible. Regrettably my partner suffered a serious bout of food poisoning while staying at the hotel which made the room a very uncomfortable experience. Fans were provided on request, but no mobile air conditioning units were available. Food quality, service and price are matters of personal expectations/experience and difficult to objectively compare. On a continuum from Michelin experience to good Mall type food the quality was poor and the service slow, dismissive and complacent. The price point for this hotel engenders high expectations which were not satisfied. E.g. $50 for consume, tomato and mozzarella salad, a beer and mint tea seemed a little expensive as was the two course, dull evening meal for $110 and the $45 cold club sandwich room service.

Hotel is still the most elegant option in Cuzco, situated near the Plaza de Armas. The property is a beautifully restored monastery dating back to the late 1600's. Service is nearly excellent; staff is friendly; food is excellent. However, this is a very pricey hotel; decor is too solemn and for some it might feel severely religious; hotel is beautiful but lacks ambiance because the \"monastery\" aspect is over-emphasized; Gregorian chants play all day, making the place feel more like a church or museum than a \"Hip Hotel.\" BIGGEST DRAWBACKS: The beds are very \"springy\" (nothing resembling \"Westin Heavenly Beds\"); avoid duplex suites because the upper level (where the sleeping area is located) gets very warm at night and since there is no air conditioning, you cannot cool the room unless you open the tiny windows (allowing all the outside noise in). Consider that sleeping in Cuzco is already challenging due to the effects of high altitude -- a warm room does nothing to alleviate insomnia. BIGGEST PLUS: You can book and pay (for a 5% service fee) the Orient Express Hiram Bingham train to Machu Picchu at the reception - there is no better train service in the Americas than this train and this is the most memorable way to visit this wonder of the world. \\Worth every cent of the $550 per head train r/t/ fare. OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT: Management could do a better job at \"ritualizing\" the coca tea served upon checking in; breakfast offerings should be less English and highlight more Peruvian fare; the hotel's personality could be less solemn; staff at the courtyard restaurant should be more proactive/anticipatory (they only serve you if called -- rarely take initiative to come over to offer any of the many expensive drinks or food) and most of all...need to find a solution to baggage storage -- piling up all luggage around the courtyard is a shame -- cheapens the whole experience; makes you think that you have arrived instead at a cheap group hotel in the Dominica Republic.", "title": "Still the best in Cuzco; but not perfect.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "ClubWorldTraveller", "date": "November 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10684313, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The service and the historical aspects of the architecture of the hotel.", "disliked": "\u2014 The solemnity of teh decor and the uncomfortable beds."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A special place to stay", "text": "You will love this hotel!!!!!Its the type of place that the minute you walk in, you feel \"good\".
