It took us about one hour, due to quite heavy Friday afternoon traffic in the Orlando area. I admit to being a bit anxious after reading the negative feedback regarding noise, creepy crawlies, surly staff, etc. Check in was pretty painless, within five minutes we were sorted and on our way to Room 1177. This room was the second closest to The International Drive exit to the hotel. The anxiety level was raised a bit by this, being the room everyone had to walk past to gain access to I`Drive. Once in the room, it was clear that the room contents were a bit dated, but clean and everything worked ok. I made a point of looking in all those places, where roaches frequented, but could not find any. The air conditioning was chugging away, and made the room feel lovely and cool away from the sweltering temperature outside. \" Us Brits aint used to this heat ! \" After a freshen up, we ventured out onto International Drive. There is a pedestrian crossing straight outside. Any person from the UK who has not been to Florida before would be well advised to use them, as the road is very busy, and the locals have a low tolerance threshold to jaywalking. There is also a bus stop number 22, bang outside. This is a great service the I Ride trolley will take you anywhere on I Drive for $1. We never used the hotel ammenities, other than the shop, so could not comment. The shop was fine, and had everything you would reasonably need. The first night was quite noisy, being a Friday. This was mainly down to young males who feel the need to cruise up and down I Drive, in vehicles with bass lines to that would make the Space shuttle lose a few tiles. After a while tiredness kicked in and we managed to sleep ok. The hectic schedule of the attractions during the following days ensured a good nights sleep was almost guaranteed. The security guy on the car park was always vigilant, we forgot to display our parking permit the second day, and he advised us to display it or you dont get in. This was reassuring. All in all, when you do the Orlando holiday thing, you are on the go all day, and you just need to rest your head in a place that is clean and safe. For the money, it is good value, if a little dated. But if you want The Waldorf Astoria you will have to pay Waldorf Astoria prices.

We found the staff very helpful and friendly. You could have a good breakfast in the dining area that would keep you going for the day. Our rooms were on the sixth floor. Lifts were always available. Don't buy anything from the souvenier shop in the hotel area as you will find the same thing on International drive for half the price. It is very central to everything on international Drive. The pool was clean and heated and was open until ten o'clock at night. There were free daily trips set up for Universal Studios, but Disney trips were expensive. Making your own way to Disney parks works out a lot cheaper. You can be picked up by un-official Disney buses and works out to be around $2 per person. They usually stop at bus stops to ask if anyone is heading to a Disney park. It is worth going with them as they are more frequent than normal buses.
