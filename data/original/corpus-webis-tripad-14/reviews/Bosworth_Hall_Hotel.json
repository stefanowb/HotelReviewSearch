On leaving today I filled in the questionaire - other than positive comments, the only things I suggested were: a tip box, as the staff were amazing, perhaps at the reception area where people could if this wished!; a map of the local walks, as we walked the local Ashby canal and would have found this helpful; greater knowledge of the local steam train timetables [they don't run on Mondays]; we walked to the local English heritage sight of the Battle of Bosworth - it would have been good if the walks had been available. On saying this - we could have found this info out prior to leaving home on the internet I suppose, but I feel the hotel could benefit from providing this info. The leisure facilities were great and the gym a real bonus, not expecting such up-to-date equipment and such a range.

There is a serious lack of attention to detail - spilled cereals over the floor and dispensers, sticky and tacky around fruit juice dispensers which were not labelled so it was guesswork as to what you were drinking.

As an experienced former championship snooker player, I do know a bit about it. In its isolated position without supervision and with complete novices using the table, the cloth may get ripped. Far better to site the table in the Leisure Club under limited supervision. A snooker table size 12' x 6' needs an area 22' x 16' to accommodate.", "title": "Could be a pleasent hotel - if they didn't fill it so full", "user": "James B", "date": "September 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 139294841}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned from a 1 night stay at Bosworth Hall Hotel which we booked for our 1st wedding anniversary. We saw the Travelzoo offer of a night's stay, carvery dinner, full breakfast, use of Spindles Leisure club and a bottle of house red or white wine for \u00a359. This seemed like outstanding value for money. I read some reviews on Tripadvisor and thought I would upgrade the room to an Executive room and paid \u00a320 extra for this and was told on the phone that our room would be overlooking the lawns, which it wasn't. It had a tiny window in the corner of the room (which was almost triangular) and looked out onto a tiny outside space of bushes which was not what I was expecting. The room was very tired - the bathroom was a good size with bath and overhead shower, however, it was in desperate need of a lick of paint as was the bedroom which had scuff marks all over the walls. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable unfortunately and neither myself nor my husband managed to sleep well at all. There was also a used tissue between the duvet cover and the bed sheet when we went to go to sleep which was quite off putting! This Executive Double room was very basic and I was honestly quite disappointed with it considering we had 'upgraded' (I dread to think what the 'standard' rooms are like)!", "title": "Mixed feelings but the bottom line is you get what you pay for", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ZeusnGoose", "date": "September 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139908928}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled solo", "text": "However, we arrived early on the Sunday (at about 12.30 instead of the stipulated 2pm) and the receptionist said our room was ready so we were able to book in earlier than we had expected which was very much appreciated.

The jacuzzi is a proper jacuzzi which actually works and is hot which was great, there is a hydra shower which is the most powerful and wonderful shower I've ever experienced!!
