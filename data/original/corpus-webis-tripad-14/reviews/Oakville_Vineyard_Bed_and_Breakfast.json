Located riight behind Opus Winery and across from Silver Oak Winery, you couldn't ask for a more perfect locale to start a visit to the wine country. What a pleasant surprise to drive down a long vineyard road and at the end find a gem caled End of Money Bed & Breakfast. The grapes were just being picked as we arrived enhancing our appreciation for the visit we were to enjoy. The three bedroom house with a huge Great Gatsby size pool was ours for three nights. We had a gas log fireplace and pool table to enjoy the cool, crisp evening and many many acres of vineyards surrounding our house. The beds were comfortable, the breakfasts were scrumptious and the hospitality by Sherry was warm and genuine. Seeing a dozen colorful hot air balloons ascend in the morning sun made for a great photo op. It was sad to say good-bye, but we look forward to our next visit and recommend this wonderful house to all.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Liz1953", "date": "October 27, 2007", "id": 10368647}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 2, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 9}, "aka": "Oakville Vineyard Hotel Oakville", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
