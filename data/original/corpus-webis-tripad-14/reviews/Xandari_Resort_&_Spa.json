Unfortunately the restaurant had closed as it was just after 9pm and we were only offered beef or chicken sandwiches. The rooms are large and beautifully decorated with wall art and ornaments. The grounds are superbly kept with gorgeous plants and flowers and walking trails which are marked with varying degrees of difficulty. The only real negative comments are directed at the swimming pool areas. One of the pools' water was completely green with a notice asking guests not to swim; the other pool was looking a bit tired, with the the surrounding concrete looking rather messy and dirty. There were some empty glasses on a table which had obviously been there since at least the evening before and were never cleared away during our entire stay. It is unfortunate that a hotel of this standard and standing allows the swimming pools to be so badly kept. Perhaps some money should have been spent in these areas in addition to the new Spa in this hotel, and their new hotel by the coast at Jaco.", "title": "Beautiful but a bit tired", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "The Penguin", "date": "February 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 4468083}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "It only takes about 20 mins upon leaving the \"craziness of San Jose\" and you arrive at this suburban oasis. The spa, food, architecture, art, rooms, grounds....all first class and truly a sensory overload. I highly recommend that you utilize the Xandari as a first or last stop destination on your CR vacation. My girlfriend and I stayed here in March 2006 for our first night. It was the peferfect spot to unwind following an afternoon of traveling...we enjoyed the spa with our private cabana, watched the sunset from our amazing villa's balcony and enjoyed a wonderful healthy meal, and plenty of wine, that evening. With regards to our Villa...do not get \"cheap\" - - upgrade, upgrade, upgrade and enjoy these amazing \"rooms.\" My only complaint of the Xandari is the condition of their pools and the immediate area surrounding them. The water truly looked green. I could not even see the bottom. Also, the pool side area was very shabby (and I promise I am not being picky). Maybe this isn't the norm...but both of us opted without hesitation to stay clear of these areas. The rest of the grounds, however, are amazing - - take a walk on one of the many trails. I've never seen so many shades of green.
