I cannot speak highly enough of the value and high standards of the accomodation. The rooms were individual and extremely clean.

The staff were very friendly and professional. It is a hotel with real character and a relaxing ambiance.

Being a real ale fan I loved the Stables bar and restaurant that sells approx 10 beers brewed on site at the hotel's microbrewery. A must for any real ale fan. We ate in the Stables restaurant - and were very impressed with the high quality of food and value for money. Breakfast in the Eden room was an experience, again great food in a beautiful period ballroom. I thoroughly recommend this hotel (and we didn't see any of its many ghosts!).

The staff were very friendly and helpful as were the bar staff in the stables bar which is part of the hotel. The hotel is a bit out of the way but excellent location for the birds of prey center, going wild adventure park and Beamish living history museum.
