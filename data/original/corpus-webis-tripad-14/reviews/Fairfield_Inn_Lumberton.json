There was a selection of cereals, bagels and waffles. However, there is a Dennys down the road at the Holiday Inn where you can purchase breakfast and so we went there.

One little note...we parked near the lobby under one of the bordering trees (not sure what it was)....in the morning when we left, our van had tiny little droplets of sap all over the front and windows.
