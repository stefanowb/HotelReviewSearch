At the time of its opening, it was considered the most fashionable hotel in town. During its first 40 years of operation the hotel was very popular among a group of artist. Cash was not always forthcoming, and as a result the hotel received a number of paintings still decorating its walls. As a guest at our hotel you will be within walking distance of attractions like Maihaugen, Lillehammer art museum, the pedestrian precinct Gagata, several restaurants and a range of activities. Ski bus to Hafjell departs close to the hotel."}
