Lighthouse Cove resort was fantastic. It's easy to locate, at light at the intersection of 14th St. and A1A, and 1/2 hour from Ft. Lauderdale airport. I walked for miles on the clean sidewalks every a.m., and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. We rented a car from Hertz (they picked us up and dropped us off after turning in the car) and enjoyed the free parking at LHC. We loved the ocean view from our studio, if you go don't forget your binoculars. LHC is beachfront and has a great pool with loads of noodles for those who enjoy floating. There's also a jacuzzi, plenty of loungers and umbrellas, tables and chairs. The beach is beautiful, snorkeling is okay at the jetty. Security is out and about and visible but not intrusive. Our studio was very clean and had an updated kitchen (granite counters, stainless steel appliances) and was the most well equipped kitchen we've ever had in a rental. An in-room safe was also available which was greatly appreciated. We had plenty of towels and there were no problems if more were needed. Food and drinks were reasonable and very good at the Tiki Bar ($2.50 breakfast) and the restaurant. A variety of live music was performed and enjoyed throughout the week. The female lead singer, performing Father's Day, was fantastic! The band played 'baby boomer' music and we loved it! The p.m. band played older music, Frank Sinatra era, and that was enjoyable as well. It's a fun place to people watch.", "title": "Great Vacation Place!

A great place for the price, mangement, location, beach, food, and accomadiations. Yes, you can go to another newer resort and pay a lot more, but you would not have the access to what i call , local fun. You have a beautiful beach a few feet away, the same beach that you would have in another more expensive resort. The same Golf , same everything. The biggest plus, in the mangement, they are helpful, and nice people to have a good time with. The tiki bar is second to none, and if you ask people where they are staying, it would be someother resort, but come there to have fun. So if you are a single person, family, or whatever, you will get the best bang for you buck at this resort. Who ever wrote\"dirty door knobs\" should know that i have stood in places much more expensive and have had dirty toilets.

Each year upgrades are made, but they are limited and sometimes there are annoying issues like broken doorwall latches, etc, that you have to deal with when you first arrive. Mgmt is prompt in fixing those issues when they are reported, and for the most part the rooms are in very good shape. The Florida humidity and salt water take a toll on everything down there, but the place is by no means a wreck. The elevators have their issues sometimes, but they work. Housekeeping is almost non-existent unless you want to pay extra, otherwise they come in and do a full cleaning once a week. However, if the place is a mess I am sure they will send someone up, they are very accommodating.

There are four buildings set in a \"U\" shape facing the ocean. In the middle there is a very large swimming pool that is cleaned meticulously. There is also a large jacuzzi that can fit about 15 people. The tiki bar has decent bar food and cold drinks, and a nice area with umbrella'd tables to sit at, plus a large wrap-around bar. There is a lot of deck space and it is all newer brick paver with nicely maintaing tropical landscaping (palm trees, bushes, etc) throughout. Lounge chairs are everywhere, as well as tables, but you might want to get down there early in the morning to claim your spot as the best spots are taken fast! All of this opens to the beach, which is very nice. You literally walk off the deck and onto the beach. Since this is the Atlantic side, there is sometimes seaweed that washes up overnight, but the beach is cleaned almost daily to remove that stuff. Beach chairs and canopies are available to guests/owners. I think there may be a nominal fee to rent one for the day, but it is not expensive. A small hut near the deck offers sunscreen and other beach items, and rents out waverunners and other fun stuff.", "title": "Would definatly go back", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hlbradley", "date": "November 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 49274732}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We rented an unit facing the beach on the first floor, two full bathrooms, a huge bedroom and a nice balcony.

Some complain of the noise from the band but I think that it would be very unfair to generalize. It just depends on where your unit is situated. I have never even heard the band or goings on at the tikki bar from the unit where I stayed. The carpet, beds, unit, everything is always very clean. The oceanfront beach view and view of the lighthouse is just out of this world in the unit I stayed in. The staff is very friendly and efficient. Should a problem be encountered they are there promptly to fix it with a smile. For example I didn't like the iron in the unit and was afraid it would stain my clothes so I called the front desk and in a few minutes they were knocking at my door with a brand new iron still in its wrapping. The full kitchen is great if you want to save a little and not have to go out to eat every night. The pool area has been completely redone. You can exchange your dirty linen for clean one as often as you like without a fuss.
