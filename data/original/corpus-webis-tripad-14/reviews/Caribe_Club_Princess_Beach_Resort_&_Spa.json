Sure there is going to be slight problems with the langage barrier but you will have that in any country you visit. The staff was VERY friendly (especially FABIO at the pool bar) and did their very best to accomidate our needs. The buffet was OK (go for the specialty resturants if you can, but make sure gentlemen have long pants with them because you will not be seated!). You will need to get to the concierage desk in your building by 8:00 am to wait in line to make a reservation for the speciality resturants. You will also need to get to the pool or beach by 7:00-7:30 am to reserve lounge chairs under a hut (believe me you will need that hut for the shade!) even though they say no reserving is permitted. Our suite (2 full beds and pull out couch) was clean, plently of fresh towels twice daily, 2 robes and slippers to use during the stay. The only problem with the room was the air conditioning was not cool enough. We had a problem on the second night with our door key and we called for an hour and a half before we approched management who had fixed the problem while we were at dinner.

Dont be suckered in by the superior rooms they talk about, these are just a regular room with two beds. Not much better than a cheap hotel room back here in the states. I was told that the room had a pullout couch so one of my children could sleep on that. Low and behold, we walked in and no couch. I went back to the front desk and spoke with the clerk who all of a sudden didnt understand English.

They were so spectacular and amazing costumes. I wouldn't suggest missing a single one. The beach bar is open with drinks all night, although most people would be at the disco or somewhere else. After the show they have a dance and drinks in the main lobby and it is fun. They really appreciate you getting up to dance with them and other people.

I know this hotel is an all-inclusive, but we did tip the staff and the maid, they so appreciate it, when you see how these people live outside of the resort it is so sad, it really makes you realize how lucky we are!! I also brought a suitcase with toys and gave them out to the dominican children when we went out on the excursions, it was a christmas for them, be careful if you do this, when you give to one child, you are swormed by so many others.
