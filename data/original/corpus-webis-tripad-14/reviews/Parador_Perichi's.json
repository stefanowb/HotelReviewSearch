It is a stones throw from the water, but no beach. The grounds and the rooms were clean, nice pool area, and lots of parking space. It may not sound like it, but I mean this review to be more of an informational one than a complaint, because we were comfortable there, but expected a little more. The hottest the hot water got all week was luke warm, and we took a couple of cold showers. The facuet in the sink was on-off, no adjustment for hot and cold, no wash cloths, just towels, no clock, no fridge, no microwave, no plug in the sink, (nice for putting in contacts) and 3 stories high with no elevator.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "diverescue", "date": "February 18, 2004", "id": 1660575}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean", "city": "Cabo Rojo"}, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 10, "very good": 9, "terrible": 19, "excellent": 4}, "aka": "Parador Perichi`s Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667}
