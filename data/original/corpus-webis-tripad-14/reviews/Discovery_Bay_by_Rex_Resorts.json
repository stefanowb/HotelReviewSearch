We have travelled to Barbados many times and have stayed at Coconut Creek(knocked down and turned into flats), King's Beach and Sea Breeze and this is now our new favourite that we will be returning to again(as soon as we can arrange it!). Clearly a lot of effort has gone into improving the restaurant - the food was far better than expected, but by far the best asset of this hotel is the staff. Their commitment to making sure our stay was as enjoyable as possible was done in a way that was never intrusive, just a pleasure to talk to them. The location of the hotel is excellent as it is in Holetown with all it's amenities. The other guests were all like minded people from several different countries - we made some new friends that I feel sure we will meet again at Discovery Bay. You may be wondering why this review is titled return of the monkeys, well they hadn't been seen at Discovery Bay for sometime but we were lucky enough to see 2 of them crossing the garden.
