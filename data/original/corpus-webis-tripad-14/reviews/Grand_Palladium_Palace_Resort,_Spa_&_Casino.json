This was our first vacation together and with our limited budget, we definitely got so much more than we expected! The buffets were amazing with almost any food you could ever want including the amazing fruit! All the workers were really good at asking what we wanted to drink and if we were enjoying our meal. The sit down restaurants were just as good with a vast array of options for people with all different tastes. The bar tenders were all so friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Everyone was so helpful and the maids did an amazing job - our room was always super clean and they even fix it twice a day leaving flowers around the room as well. The beach was beautiful of course and the pools were awesome - many of them connected and we basically had our own private pool! August is definitely the time to go. The only negative is all the sales men on the beach trying to sell you excursions but the whole experience is so great it isn't even that big of a bother! We would definitely recommend this hotel and thought the whole experience was a 10 out of 10!!", "title": "Disappointing... the food, the drinks, the air conditioning all left something too be desired...", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "patlynnfe", "date": "August 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 174988793}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in a loft suite. Two beds upstairs and one pull out couch downstairs. The pullout did not have an appropriate mattress and was held on the metal supports with makeshift pillows. We tended to use this bed to watch tv while the kids were sleeping upstairs, this was super uncomfortable due to the inadequate support because the mattress was drooping between the metal and the pillows kept moving out of place. Horrible. The rooms were kept really clean by the maids daily and the mini bar was restocked daily. If we needed extra water there was no problem asking the mini bar guy. My daughter had an accident in the kids pool section with the shipwreck. Beware all parents the water slides are FAST. My daughter slipped and fell head first, knock her front teeth loose. The doctor on the premises was very nice and referred us to a dentist. There were always sun beds available on the beach and could easily find shade close to the beach bar. The pools were really nice and clean. The buffet always had nice food variety. The a la Carte's were good too. Our fave was the tepenyaki but the experience depended on the team u got. We went twice first time was an awesome experience the second was mediocre. Overall we had a great family vacation. With lots to do to fill your day. The staff were all really nice. My kids loved the mini club and I loved that it was clean and modern. They provide parents with a cell phone so if kids are missing parents they can call you to come. I loved that. I would go back but hopefully they fix the sofa bed mattress situation because it was honestly disappointing to see that they expect ppl to sleep on that. My kids loved the train rides and so did I :) the prices at the gift shop are ridiculous, save ur money and buy at the airport because they sell the same for a fraction of the price.

I agree with several other post I have read tho about the Air conditioning it Sucks~ and their excuse is we're working on it~ thank god my fan worked on just low tho cuz it kept what air I did get circulating . The restaurants food was Ok by no means do u go hungry.. Just wished they offered better desserts they were abit dull tasting... Met a few couples on the plane from Cincinnati and that made trip awesome at least they spoke English because 90% there didn't !! Even the other guest there all spike foreign . The circus show was good my dad and I went every night they are good but like someone else said -don't expect Las Vegas entertainment . The drink that mostly several drank was called a Maimi Vice : ) very tastie. The beach was one of the most beautiful beaches I have been too. They offer a shopping trip we took it ~ was disappointed WE thought we were going shopping But the take you to this 1 shop that this lady runs and you are there for 2 hrs it sells a lot of jewelry Nice jewelry and cigars.. Come to find out that the hotel offered a shopping trip to mall we wished we would have done instead. We did do 1 excursion for a whole day the safari one which was Awesome Loved it!! Others did the dune buggy trip which they said was fun too. Just a heads up we did leave our towels by the pool one day and 1 was stolen the hotel was going to charge us 15.$ but spoke to manager and they said do not leave your towel- all in all was a nice trip weather was nice ~ rained the last day almost all day... But was well worth the money we spent Just Hoping Vacation Express offers a return trip to my BF sense he didn't get to go and got nothing for his money so we can do this trip together~ oh I did learn 1 word in Spanish Yellow~ it Means ICE cuz they never put ice in their soda pop drinks -", "title": "Excellent honeymoon", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mcc1uk", "date": "September 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 178801094}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We have just returned after spending 6 nights in the Palladium palace.

We were part of a larger group of about 100 people attending the Palladium Addicts Fiesta. Check In was quick as soon as they figured out where to route us. We had 4 rooms in The Royal Suites and 1 Room in The Palace. All the rooms were ready and we got to them within 30 minutes. My room at the Palace was 9212, Great location, view of the beach and the ocean and steps away from The Royal Suites, we could see the building where 2 of our other rooms were located.We also had access to The Royal Suites so that when my daughter was with our Nanny we could enjoy that part of the resort with our group and all of the other Addicts. My room in The Palace was a loft suite, very nice size but not set up for a family with little kids, we had two double beds on the second level and we had 3 adults and my 4 year old up there. Yes beds are hard but not really an issue and we had no problems with the pillows. The jetted tub is in the middle of the room which we could not use because of privacy and noise but we did not travel to sit in a tub so we were fine with that. The lower level had a bathroom and living area, there is a pull out couch but we did not use it. The room is very outdated but super clean and functional. I am sure it will be on the upgrade list as they are totally renovating the Bavaro side right now. The room did have a ton of storage for clothing, shoes, etc. The balcony was a great size and fantastic view. We did have little ants in our sink but it is the tropics and we expect that and they do not bother us, they love the flowers in the rooms and any sugary drinks that you leave around. We bring zip loc bags for all of my daughters snacks and never have an issue. Our fridge was not cold when we got there but you need to have a room key in the wall at all times and leave a cabinet door open so the fridge will run, it was cold the rest of the week, same with air conditioning, by the next morning we were freezing. Our maid was fantastic and came a minimum of twice a day sometimes 3 times, we always had beer and soda, and did have to call for water but we did use a lot of it, they always brought whatever we asked for.
