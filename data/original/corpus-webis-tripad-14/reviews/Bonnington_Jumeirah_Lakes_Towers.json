The apartments are extremely comfortable and spacious and a 2 bedroom is perfect for a family of 4-6, whilst the 3 bedroom can accommodate between 6-8 very comfortably. The bedrooms are of a good size and the beds extremely comfortable, but my only gripe is regarding the Master Bathroom which I feel should have had a separate shower cubicle. The views from the 34th floor are awesome. The area is perfect as the metro is a few minutes from the Hotel while a walk to The beach is a mere 20 minutes away, (time saving as it takes ages for the taxi to get there with all the traffic,especially at nights).
