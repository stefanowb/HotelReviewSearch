{"user_rating": 4.5, "review_count": 427, "name": "Katerina City Hotel", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled on business", "text": "All in all I like this hotel, its clean nice and doesn't have that hookers in the lobby feel you hear about in many of the hotels here in Russia. I found the breakfast bar to be great. Every morning they have a very wide selection of food, 2-3 types of sausage, bacon, eggs (scrambled and hard boiled) assorted lunch meats, fresh fruit, a couple of different yogurts and cottage cheese. They also have porridge or cream of wheat or cream of rice (it seems to rotate) as well. Also some fried mushrooms, cucumbers/or squash, tomatoes etc. They also have 3 or 4 types of cereals, russian pancakes or the one which is like a crepe made into a burrito with kurds (cottage cheese) inside coffee or tea etc. I did find its better to go earlier in the morning as when I went on Saturday some of the warm food had been sitting in the warming trays too long (a little over cooked sausage for example) but I went right before they closed at 10:45 am. They close on weekdays at 10AM. There is free Wifi and it seems to work pretty well, a small bar in the lobby and another one called the library on the 8th floor, but I went there on Thursday night and it appeared to be closed (although the sign said it would be open form 8PM on-wards. Ordering a taxi here is a little bit more expensive but from what I can tell its not a completed gouging, they charge 600 Rubles for 30 minutes 950 for an hour, I heard some guys picked up a taxi on the street one day and got charged a 1000 Rubles for a 10 minute ride. So at least you know what your getting I guess. They charged me 1900R from SVO airport to the hotel, which was about 1.5 hours with the traffic. Otherwise the room is a little small and definitely has that IKEA feel to it, OK furniture but not super fancy either. Free mini bar is nice (two bottle water with gas, two without, and two cokes and two juices every day, also some potato chips and small chocolate bar and peanuts. I have raided it every day and they refill it the next. The lobby staff have been very helpful and everyone understand English. Also due to working late a couple of nights I ordered room service 3X's, and all in all it was a little expensive but pretty good food. I didn't like the swedish canepe's so much (a little too fishy) but the borcht was fine, the blinis and russian pelemeni were good as well. I thought the chicken sandwich was ok but it was made with minced meat, and I would prefer a normal chicken breast, but it wast horrible. So all in all I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Katerina, but do not expect a real luxury hotel, but its a big step above a tourist hotel as well. Somewhere in between, I would compare to a courtyard or a doubletree in the USA. Price wise from what I compared here in moscow it seems to be a reasonable deal, but its not cheap either.

Staff at reception is friendly and attentive, they speak fluent English. Bar on the top floor was closed, a pity, as there is a nice view of the city up there. lobby bar is not very atmospheric. Otherwise, there is no entertainment. The hotel is a place to regenerate and relax, oh yes, there was a sauna in the base floor (I didn't visit).
