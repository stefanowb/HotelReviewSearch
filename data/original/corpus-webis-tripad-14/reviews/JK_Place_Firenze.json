I had let the hotel know this in advance, and they upgraded us to a Junior Suite on arrival. The rooms were beautiful - very stylish and perfectly maintained. The staff were absolutely charming throughout - they really couldn't have been any nicer or more helpful. The common parts of the hotel are equally chic and the breakfast just right (although not huge). I can't recommend the hotel highly enough. My only criticisms are that the Piazza S M Novella is the scruffiest in Florence and that the hotel is quite expensive - however you get what you pay for!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "TravelwithkidsLondon", "date": "May 10, 2005", "id": 3457096}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "I recently stayed at JK Place for four nights. I had a classic room and my parents had a superior room which was slightly bigger. We orginally were planning to stay at the another hotel until I came upon the reviews on tripadvisor. After checking out the website and sending countless emails to the hotel, we finally decided to try it out. Well, we were NOT disappointed. From the time we were fetched at the airport to the time we left, JK place made our Florence vacation memorable. We were pampered throughout our stay, and no request seemed impossible. Our restaurant reservations were taken care of, car arrangements for day trips to Sienna, and just about everything else we needed. I felt like royalty vacationing in one of my palaces. JK place does not feel like a hotel- it feels like a home- a luxurious one at that, with a staff ready to see to your every need without being intrusive. Breakfast, and the snacks served all day were absolutely divine. We loved relaxing in the tv room (super chic yet comfy) in the afternoons, drinking coffee and snacking on the home made tart of the day. I cannot say enough great things about this gorgeous place and the wonderful staff that made our stay enjoyable. The location is convenient- everything of importance was a ten minute walk at most. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Special thanks to Sabrina and Angela who went out of their way to accomodate my requests. But really the entire staff was superb. I've stayed in many top hotels around the world, but JKPlace beats them hands down in service.", "title": "Fantastic hotel", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Cherish", "date": "April 12, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3352143}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "It's all true...", "text": "Just returned from our honeymoon, stayed for 2 nights. Read other reviews on this website and thought JK Place sounded too good to be true; this is not the case. As another traveller remarked in his or her review, it actually felt like I was staying at my rich uncle's house while he was away; and he instructed his entire staff to take great care of us. The accommodations are ultra-chic, but cozy; the common areas are absolutely gorgeous. It's the little things, like having access to complimentary potato chips, coffee and other munchies during the day or the fresh fruit in your room when you arrive, that really make you feel at home.

J.K Place has carved out an exceptionally pleasant niche for itself, a niche that\u2019s just seconds from the door of the stunning church of Santa Maria Novella. All the major sites are within easy walking distance. The rooms: Just twenty of them, snazzy, characterful, no two are alike, and all with signature soft furnishings in creams, granges and neutrals offset with contrasting piping in an effortlessly chic Anouska meets Ralph love-in. The glass covered courtyard and roof terrace beckon on warmer days whilst winter afternoons are best spent huddled by the fireplace in the J.K Lounge with a thick slice of cake and a steaming hot cioccolata con panna. Add very friendly, discreet service plus probably the city\u2019s best Concierge and you are just asking for a good time!"}
