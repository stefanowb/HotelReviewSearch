It was very busy. As it was said in previous reviews, the rooms are big, the hotel and the area around the hotel are very clean. The pool is huge (there is also a separate children's pool) and the water there was very warm and pleasant. There is a big sandy beach, so our daughter (3 y.) enjoyed playing and building sandcastles and because the water is so shallow she spent lots of time in the sea instead of a pool. The facilities are generally good, but the gym is tiny (one treadmill, one bicycle, one stepper and a few weights), though it was almost always empty. The only real issue with this hotel was the food. It was ok (I did not hear anyone complain about any tummy upsets), but I would expect much better variety and quality (it just does not taste good) from a five star hotel. We tried Italian restaurant and I would not advise to have pizza there, it tasted like PizzaHut.", "title": "Good hotel but the food is not very nice", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ivy30", "date": "March 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 14678613}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "But overall, we enjoyed our stay there.

We found the hotel clean and the room was quite big, but the drinks were prohibitvely expensive although the staff were friendly and helpful, although on those prices I would expect them to be! We booked through Thomson (wouldn't recommend their flight meals as they were inedible). We booked into their health club for a massage and had terrible trouble, they had overbooked and we waited for 1.5 hrs and then never got a massage at all. I would strongly recommend keep away from this part of the hotel complex as they are rude, abusive even when they are in the wrong. The beach was much larger than sharks bay but wouldn't go there with my children as they would lose me! Sharks Bay is much more compact and much safer with children, we went without children this time, and sharks bay is a much more pleasant experience. We noticed this time that there is no hassle at the airport with egyptians trying to give you a trolley and also in Naama Bay the hassle is much less than in the previous 3 years that we have been and a much more pleasant experience. The old peugeot taxis have all been removed as they were deemed unsafe but make sure you haggle all price trips before getting into any taxis.

Although there are several restaurants to choose from, we have always eaten in the main buffet restaurant where there is an excellent range of food with different themes each night. The hotel is situated on the delightful Ras Nasrani Bay where the snorkelling is excellent. We have in past years been out on snorkelling trips but now we just enjoy going out from the hotel beach where there is a beautiful coral garden and a fantastic range of fish.", "title": "BARON RESORT IS THE TOPS", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "BirkenheadCatwoman1", "date": "September 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 44949070}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "great place, clean, very well maintained, happy helpful staff. Heated pool which is huge and great to swim, loads of sun beds, although due to daily brezes the good sheltered ones went early ( about 9 am ) they had towels on? food was good, we were on a Band B and the food during lunch and dinner was cheap ( 20 pounds for 2 people) rooms were big, some are garden views so we upgraded and it was well worth it, sea view with balcony, great showers in the room, about 10 english tv channels with music, sport and news and 3 film channels i think, i had a browse but it was my honeymoon ??? clientele were english , eouropean and russian but good attitude around hotel, some people were slightly rude but not sure if thats because us english are just so polite. My little tip would be to take a travel kettle as they dont have one in the room. The weather was hot, with a nice cool breeze somedays, evenings you need a sweater but its not that bad. Basically there is a little street to walk along but mainly hotel based. Great house reef for diving and snorkelling , very clear water and hardly any divers in the water. Overall we had a great time. One week is enough though due to its location, would recommend it as a couple get away and the only reason i would not go back is i never do.

I'm glad to say they haven't yet succumbed to the 'burger and chips' mentaility and I hope they don't try to cater for the usual Brits abroad palate. The staff are so friendly and contribute towards the enjoyment and pleasure. The pool is excellent as is the beach. The public areas of the hotel are also extremely attractive and the overall housekeeping is absolutely spotless - there are an army of staff continually cleaning everything in sight and it really pays off. Robes are provided in the room and a fresh beach towel provided daily on request - I like that! My only negative comments regarding the hotel are that the rooms - whilst spacious - lack the finesse and luxury that you would expect in a 5 star resort. Also, the gym facilities are poor. We were also very unhappy with the beauty treatments we had in the resort, although this was not the salon found within the hotel itself, it was on the boulevard. I also felt disappointed at being unable to swim in the sea straight from the shore, as you had to walk down the jetty and enter from there to avoid the coral. It's also impossible to go for a walk outside of the hotel because there's nothing there and the road is quite dangerous. There is also limited bar availability and so a trip to Naama Bay is the only option if you want some fun.
