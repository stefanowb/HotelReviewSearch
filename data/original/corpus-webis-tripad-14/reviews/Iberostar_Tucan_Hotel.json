About 6 weeks before the wedding, he confirmed that he unfortunately would not be able to make it. No problem, Catalina confirmed the Mexican minister's availability and arranged for him to perform the ceremony instead. He did a lovely job! I never got to actually meet him since he left right after the ceremony and I was distracted, but I really wish I could have- he seemed like a very kind man.
