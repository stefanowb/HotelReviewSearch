Had a room with sea view and balcony on the 4th floor (bit of a climb but got used to it!). Room was modern and comfortable. Air conditioning was very efficient. Found all the staff at the hotel friendly, helpful and professional. Breakfast was also very good (both the food and the service). Hotel location very convenient for Taormina centre.
