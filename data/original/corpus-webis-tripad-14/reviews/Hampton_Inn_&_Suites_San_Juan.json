Great breakfast, with friendly staff! The beds and pillows are excellent....I went down with a bunch of teenagers, so we have a couple of rooms. I thought the suites were on the small side. Hotel staff is friendly and keeps the 100% satisfaction guarantee at heart. I found the front desk personnel friendly and always ready to help.", "title": "Hampton Inn", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "antzinpants", "date": "February 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4514224}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 16, "average": 52, "very good": 234, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 279}, "aka": "Hampton Inn & Suites San Juan Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.142857142857, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "At Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton San Juan you can relax and enjoy our beautiful recently renovated pool and Jacuzzi\u00ae area.
