Although, I believe the term \"resort\" is misleading. This is a wonderful oasis in the desert - near the village of Hodka. The village is walled - and contains three bungas (wonderfully elaborate mud huts) and 12 tents. Each has it's own bathing facility. There is a central eating area where you are served three meals a day (all vegetarian). In the evenings local people come and dance/sing/play instruments for guest's enjoyment (when there are guests at the resort - I was there almost alone two nights, hence no entertainment). I greatly enjoyed this experience and used this resort as my daily jumping off point to visit local more remote villages closer to the Pakistan border - to visit local artisans.
