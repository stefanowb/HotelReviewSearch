It was an awesome experience. We arrived at this Ranch on July 31st to stay one night. The road to the Grand Canyon west rim was unpaved for about 20 miles but the drive was exciting. Suggest that you rent a car for this trip. Arrived at the ranch and was greeted by a person named Patrick. He was very accomodating and informed us what we should do and where we should go to obtain tickets to register at this place. Although we did not have the pre-registration tickets, he did give the cottage keys and allowed us to drive directly to the cottage to unload our luggage. Following that we visited the skywalk and Guano Point. Returned to the ranch to have dinner. There was a 'one man' band and the songs he played was lovely, while we had dinner which consisted of either ribs or chicken (bbq) & 2 sides with a chocolate chip cookie. Although the cafetaria board indicates that we have to select two of the 6 sides, they gave us a little of everything. It was just a matter of asking the servers and they were quite accommodating. There were unlimited soft drinks/coffee/tea/hot chocolate etc. The cafetaria is open for unlimited drinks/water 24/7 (which is included in your price) which was great during the time we visted as the weather was hot. Also there was a magician named Chris Magic to entertain you.
