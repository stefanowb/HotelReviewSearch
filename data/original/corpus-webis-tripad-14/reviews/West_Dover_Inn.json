Food was great...the room was adorable. Loved the fireplace. It was a lot of fun and close to the mountain. Recommend the West Dover Inn for a nice getaway.

I went online, found the West Dover Inn and booked one of their 'last minute specials'. I can't tell you how impressed we were! The rate was very, very reasonable and the place was great. Typical quaint Vermont inn. There weren't many quests the night we stayed so we were given a quick little tour of a few different rooms and were allowed to pick our own. I was most impressed with the attention to detail there. They actually have personalized lip balm in the rooms!

Well, we did some driving around, but headed right back to the West Dover Inn for dinner and to hang out. The owners, Phil and Kathy, are very welcoming and fun to chat with. Phil's a die-hard Red Sox fan so my husband quickly bonded with him. On Saturday nights there is a jazz pianist who plays in the dining room. Once the dinner service was over, we (Phil, Kathy, some locals and ourselves) played name-that-showtune with the pianist.
