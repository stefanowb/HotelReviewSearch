Let me just say we were very sad to have to leave Sunday morning. We were treated like royalty from the time we pulled into the drive way till we left Sunday morning. The Hotel, the rooms and the breakfast are as good and even better than I have ever had, but what makes the Avia Woodlands is the staff, period. I have traveled the world extensively and stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and this little hotel has the best service I have ever had anywhere. The parking staff, bell hops, front desk staff and especially Jason.
