The hotel is located right in the Gaslamp and is walking distance to lots of restaurants including the Horton Mall in case you want to do some shopping. The hotel staff is very friendly -- as you would expect from Kimpton. I asked for a suggested running route and they had a nice map with different routes near the hotel. I mentioned I was interested in getting a massage and they gave me a$25 off coupon for the spa. The room was spacious, well designed with modern decor. The rooms have not been updated since the takeover from Sei although they don't need it as the Sei decor was very Kimpton-ish. The one complaint I have about the room is the desk is adjacent to the dresser on which the TV sits so it's really crowded if you use a laptop and even more so if you get takeout and attempt to eat from the desk while you also have your laptop going. I stayed for nearly a week so I did a lot of work from my hotel room and the crowding was sort of annoying, not awful or unbearable though. I used the hotel gym and it was well equipped and I never had to wait for any machines. One suggestion: they really need to close the door to the gym so it can maintain a cool temperature. It was extremely hot in there due to the door being left open and the room being unable to stay cool despite the air conditioning which was set at 66 degrees. They also need to put the gym location on the signs in the elevator. For two days I kept forgetting what floor it was on and it wasn't listed on any of the elevator signs. My rate included free continental breakfast so I took advantage of that one morning and it was pleasant. Very quick, efficient (which I needed since I was already running late) and a filling, delicious meal. I did not order room service or eat dinner in the hotel restaurants so can't comment on that. I did enjoy the free coffee in the hotel lobby each morning which was a treat as I left on my way to the office. I was at the hotel for 5 nights and overall it was a very pleasant experience. I've stayed at other hotels for this length of time and it's hard to feel comfortable and \"at home\" for that long in a hotel and that was not the case here. I will definitely stay here again.", "title": "Lovely Hotel in Gaslight District", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ellen49690", "date": "May 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 129977776}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I've stayed in a Kimpton before.

From the moment we met him, he ensured that every element of our stay was taken care of.

If you are looking to relax at the pool, get some sun, and have a few drinks....this may not be the place for you. The pool is located on the north side of the building, which means the sun is blocked from the entire pool area until about 1:30 in the afternoon.
