We stayed in a Palm unit with our 3 kids and felt the space was more than adequate and the extra bathroom makes a huge difference. Love the lanai's (Balcanies). We had 3 families staying in different units all traveling together and everyone had an excellent stay. Some units are more up to date than others but we spent most of our time at the various beaches and other activities out side the hotel-it's not the ritz, but it is great. It is a perfect base camp and we woke well rested every morning ready for adventure. The new shops and restaruants on Lewers street make this one of the best locations in waikiki. You have everything you need with in a few strides...literally. The beach is 3 minutes or less...enjoy all Waikiki has to offer from this perfect location! Nice pool and hot tub upstairs-the pool was a little chilly. Leave your beach towels at home you can check them out from the hotel...nice touch.

I read in previous reviews that if you are a timeshare owner, you get better treatment. It doesnt hold true (at least for us). I went in with a positive attitude about this place and considered all the nice reviews posted on this site. I requested a high floor in advance and the lady I spoke to was very nice and said they'll do everything to try and accommodate our request. We were assigned a PALM unit on the 9th floor. I said to myself, well this isnt a high floor but I didnt say anything. My heart sank as soon as we opened the room. The room was not only very outdated, it smelled outdated too. Our room was on the back of the building which gave us a nice view of the back of the adjacent hotel and the parking lot next door. Needless to say, it was dark and gloomy. We immediately called the front desk to try and see if we can get a better room but the receptionist was not helpful. He told us that they are fully booked and that there is nothing they can do about it. They said to try and call again in the morning. I tried to not let it ruin our vacation so we immediately unpacked and started heading out to the beach. WHen we returned later in the evening and were getting ready for bed. I pulled out the murphy bed from the wall so my 5 year old can sleep on it. As soon as I did, the dust came flying out of the wall, when you peek in the space between where the bed was and the wall, it seemed like no one cleaned it for ages. The dust was very thick. Since we were so tired, we made our best to tough it out and get a good night rest. For the next couple of days, we pretty much just stayed out of the room, only to go back and sleep. On our third day, my husband went down to the front desk to see if they can change our room but the receptionist was again unrelenting, he said he cannot do anything. My husband asked if there's anyone he can talk to, it just so happened that the manager was walking by, he then explained the situation and he immediately resolved the problem. We got a KOA room on the 15th floor. I found it to be cleaner, brighter and much more roomier. It didn't matter to us that both showers didnt have enough hot water pressure (almost like a trickle) so we took semi cold showers until the hot water started running like normal again towards the end of our trip. Just as I was about to say, this place is not too bad, another incident happened. We came back to our room after spending time on the beach and found that the door was left wide open. It looked like someone fixed the beds but forgot to clean the rest of the place. The garbage was not picked up nor were our towels and toiletries re- stocked. They just made the beds and left. (Remember, if you're checking in using timeshare, you only get the room cleaned once a week). After checking the whole place, we found that nothing was missing (thankfully) but we called immediately and security was sent to our room and had our door re keyed. The hotel has apologized but it really just wasnt acceptable for us. The only perks I can agree to is that the location is very good. You're within walking distance of good restaurants and shops. Valet service was great and friendly, giving us good directions all the time. They have a good selection of DVD's in the lobby that you can rent for $3.00. ABC store is conveniently accessible downstairs. Other than this, I can't think of anything else that's nice about it. The hotel pool was small and looked like an oversized bath tub (about half the size of a normal pool and I'm not exaggerating). You're better off swimming in the warm, beautiful beaches. Hopefully, other travelers will have a much better experience (and better room) than what we had. Unfortunately, our experience is such that we probably won't come back here again unless they do some much needed work on their hotel.", "title": "It was doable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mdlvc", "date": "June 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 16704868, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 convenient location close to shops and restaurants", "disliked": "\u2014 Outdated rooms and facilities"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Mahalo Imperial Waikiki", "text": "May 10 2008", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Carla027", "date": "May 10, 2008", "id": 15891969}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We just returned home from a wonderful vacation in Hawaii (Oahu).
