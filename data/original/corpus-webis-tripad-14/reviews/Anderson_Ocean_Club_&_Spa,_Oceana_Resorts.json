However despite having requested handicap accessible room we didn't get one.I complained and was told \"Oh you are here on the Hilton package\" so neither Hilton nor Anderson Club would change our room. My poor family member had to sponge bath the whole time and wash his hair in the kitchen sink.They also have no Handicap Accessibility to the beach. I was told Oh we can help him down the beach. Right he's 6ft 2 inches tall and weights 250lbs. and 2 little non medically trained people are going to heave-Hoo I don't think so! We was on the 20th floor. Between the Hilton people doing tours and stopping right outside our bedroom window (which is on the hall side) and loudly pointing out the view and the maids letting doors slam rooms next door it was hard to rest well during the day. The balcony has no screen if you leave the door open BUGS come flying in. They have no restaurant in the building but you can cross the street to a place that must have stock in CRISCO because they deep fat fry everything and the veggies are so over cooked they are a water/mushy mess. Sorry but this place really missed it and I don't think it will be on my top list of places to stay.

Too crowded, too touristy, too much traffic! But I'm so glad I gave the off-season a chance and the Anderson Ocean Club was just the place to do it. Our 3-BR condo made the perfect place to relax with friends. The kitchen was fairly well-appointed and had nice new appliances, and the dining/sitting area gave us plenty of room to spread out. We were on the 9th floor and had a balcony that stretched from the sitting area to the master BR. It was amazing to lie in bed at night and listen to the ocean! The view was amazing and there was plenty of sitting area on the balcony for all 6 of us. The bedrooms each had an en suite bath. Unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to use the spa because it looked great. The only complaint I have about the entire weekend is that the free parking is in a deck across the street and down the block, not exactly convenient, so most people appeared to use the $12/day valet parking. The valet area was very small and the cars kept backing up as people came and went. I can't imagine how they deal with this in the summer. The beach is beautiful here and made it easy to take long walks. I can't wait to go back to the Club --- but I think I'll stick with off-season every time!", "title": "An off-season treat!", "user": "kgoley", "date": "November 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183430327}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013", "text": "Since this was our first time visiting Myrtle Beach, we didn't know what to expect.

Checking in was easy and they gave us the free valet parking placard for HGVC owners. It was nice to have the bellhop cart to bring up our luggage. While I did not request for an oceanfront room at check in (was too tired to remember to), it would have been nice to have been offered that option, complimentary or not...the resort was very empty as it was off-season. We were assigned to unit 1200, a 2-bed/2-bath facing north, so we still could see a slice of ocean off our teeny balcony.

From the time I pulled in to the smiles of the friendly valet staff, to the sweetheart behind the desk, my welcome was what one would completely consider 'Southern Hospitality'. The valet whisked us to our room (two of us in two separate cars with an amazing amount of 'stuff') in a matter of minutes. We were able to check in early, which thrilled us both, as on a chilly day we wanted to hit the hot tub. When we walked into our room my friend was thrilled (making me the hero for booking) as was I. We had a VERY large 1 bdrm. suite. The view was stunning, ALL ocean. Not only were the balcony furnishings MUCH nicer than other hotels in this area, but the walls were so deep that we had privacy. The king bed was very comfy, and surprisingly so was the murphy bed. I've slept on a murphy bed in the past with a sore back as a result. Kudos to you Anderson for getting it right. The kitchen had everything we would need and more. One added bonus, a whirlpool tub.. Ok, that was the room.. The hot tub was great! One covered and one open to the stars. We were able to order cocktails from the bar (literally steps from the Jacuzzi) and relax in complete bliss! I must say that this resort quickly became a favorite of mine. The staff was wonderful!!! The maid even dropped what she was doing to help me down with my bags the day I left.
