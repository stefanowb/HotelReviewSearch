We were in room 109 - the Don Juan room - and, between the noise and the smell, I can't imagine Don Juan getting any action in that room. Had we not been in Seville during the April Festival, we would have switched hotels. On the plus side, the shower was great (but the bathroom was tiny). The hotel is in a great location and the breakfast spread was very nice. We booked this place based on the reviews posted to Tripadvisor, so I'm sure there are much better rooms in this hotel.

Ideal if you want to capture the true feel of Seville and its culture. Could be difficult for people with special needs as the taxi cannot take you the last part, which is about two minute walk. Staff helpful. bath and a shower..clean rooms. Very quaint. White coffee is heaven..and you can take drinks up into your room, via the lift. Breakfast good...hot and cold or both if you want and real fresh orange juice, served 8 till 10.30a.m. when we were there, and you did'nt have to check out until 12.00 which is a plus for me, I am only just about coming round then! Lift and 21 bedrooms, so very personal, not like some of the large Hotels. Ideal location for shopping but not your high street stores, they are about 20 min walk but then, I am not interested in them.

What tapas means is that you start eating early in the day and don't stop 'till midnight! P. S. While you're in Seville, make sure to take a trip out to Italica and then hit the archeological museum.
