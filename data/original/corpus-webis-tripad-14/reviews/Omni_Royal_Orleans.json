However, despite not being disturbed by street noise my fiance and I were greatly disturbed last night by the two men having very loud \"relations\" in the room next door to us. The problem was that the rooms were adjoining and it sounded like they were right inside of our room with us. They didnt go to sleep the whole night and as a result neither did we. My problem with the hotel is as follows: Not all of the rooms in the hotel are adjoining. The hotel was not even close to be being fully booked. There was no reason to put us in an adjoining room and/or they could have informed us that we were being put in such a room and given us an option of a non-adjoining room. Now these things happen and I understand that but this morning when I approached the front desk and told them very nicely what transpired and offered a suggestion that they may want to inform guests at check in of the adjoining rooms and if other options are available offer them and they basically said sorry about that but you should have called us to have your room changed. Who wants to change rooms at 2am after spending a night enjoying the music, food, and drinks of NO. They made us feel like it was our fault and we were not happy about that to say the least. The only reason I said something in the first place was so that they were aware that this happens and offer them a suggestion on how to create better customer satisfaction. There was nothing in it for me. I was just trying to help them because it was ashame that our stay was ruined by this because it is truly a very nice hotel. The pool is very neat with its views of the city and again the rooms were comfortable (though I couldnt get any cold water in the shower. It was around 100 degrees out.), and the location perfect.

We got suited up and went to the pool but there were only around 10 chairs, which of course were all taken, so we had no where to sit and went back to the room. To top it all off, there were tons of hidden charges and taxes. The parking was $28 a day plus tax, internet- $6 for 15 minutes. I hate to be a whiner but I feel I must warn you... this hotel has Holiday Inn flair with a Ritz Carlton price tag.", "title": "Not Quite Royal", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "srqchic", "date": "June 4, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 5296461}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent choice in the French Quarter", "text": "If you are looking for a French Quarter hotel, this is an excellent location--basically centered in the part of the Quarter that is of interest to most tourists. Staff were helpful and friendly. Check in was especially good, our reservation requests were accommodated and our rooms were upgraded to a larger size than we booked, all without asking. Roof top pool is nice. This is a gracious older hotel, well maintained. It was always nice to return to this oasis of cool and quiet after venturing out in the French Quarter. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but room service was very good. Only negatives were minor maintenance issues (i.e. slight leak from one shower head).
