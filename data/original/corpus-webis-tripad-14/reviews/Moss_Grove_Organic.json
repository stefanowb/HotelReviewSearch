Unlike my husband I'm not one of those people who need to have a huge cooked breakfast every morning. I loved the Meditteranean food, and pastries. Our room was cosy, but big. Had an enormous bed, that was comfy. The only thing I can say is that some people were having a party in the hotel across the road one night that drove us mad.
