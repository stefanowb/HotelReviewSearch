Our room was huge with a big bathroom and big balcony overlooking the pool and beautiful rice fields with the mountains to one side and the sea through a row of palms on the other. The cleaning of the room and bathroom did not quite live up to the standard of the rest of it. The breakfasts were good but the restaurant does not seem to be much used otherwise. It is a bit of a walk to the shops, restaurants etc but is nice and quiet because of that. The boatman who took us snorkelling and dolphin watching was good and we really enjoyed our trips with Gede as driver.", "title": "Huge room, lovely view", "user": "jean333", "date": "September 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 77871963}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for two nights, this was not long enough, we wished we could stay longer. Our room was huge, it was spotlessly clean. King sized bed, a sofa, mini bar with very reasonable prices. The bathroom was amazing with a huge seperate shower room. The balcony was also huge with a table and chairs and two pool loungers. Breakfast was great, we ate around the pool but you could eat in a number of well laid out areas. We had dinner on the first night and it was exceptionally good. The glass fronted kitchen means that you can see just how spotless this small resort is. The swimming pool was also great. This small boutique resort is a little out of the way. It's down a long laneway from the main road but it's definitely walkable. We walked back after dinner on the second night without a problem, however we did have a small torch each which is really necessary as towards the end the laneway runs out of houses and has little lighting. All in all a wonderful experience and we definitely want to go back.", "title": "Absoloutely Fantastic", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JoeFlo", "date": "August 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 77578031}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We came from Nusa Dua to stay in this hotel for 2 nights; what a bad experience.
