That said, having stayed in many European hostels, I was surprised that many of the guests were not youth at all. There were many mid-aged adults and some older adults. Some of the mid-aged adults seemed to be staying on an extended basis for the low cost accomadations, rather than being travelers like you usually find in hostels. Specifically, there was one guy who was there all three days we were there who spent the whole day by himself sleeping in a chair.
