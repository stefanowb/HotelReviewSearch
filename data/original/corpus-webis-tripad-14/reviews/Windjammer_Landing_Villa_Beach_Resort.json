It was everything my husband and I were hoping for and then some. I knew nothing about St. Lucia. My parents had given us a timeshare book to look through and allowed us to select a honeymoon as our gift from them. We picked a few places and then drew one out of a hat. And St. Lucia it was. The only reason St. Lucia was an option was because of this website. I figured that there must be something great about this place since so many people gave it 5 stars. I was confused with some of the negative comments but went ahead and took the chance. We went the first week in November. We flew into the southern airprot (HEW). The drive was long but really gave you a feel for the island which started the trip off right. The taxi driver even asked if we wanted to stop and get our photo taken at a neat overcliff. We did and it turned out great. Our hotel room was really unique. Very clean. Large yet cozy. Open but can be closed. Perfect temperature. Cute kitchen with a bottle of champaign and fruit tray waiting for us. Robes on our bed. And the open terrace was breathtaking. The view stretched for miles and we could even see other islands and the pirate ship sailing every morning and evening. That is where we got some of our best pictures. We really enjoyed the one bedroom villa without a plunge pool because then you have the option of opening up your room or completely closing it if you are worried about bugs.", "helpfulness": 23, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 1, 2005", "id": 3237700}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2005", "text": "We did not have a bug problem at all except for a cute baby lizard that made its way in. My husband opened the doors one day and birds flew right in. We let them enjoy themselves for a moment and then sent them on their way. I was really afraid that the brochure only looked great and the hotel would not. However it was picture perfect just as it looks online and in the brochure. The beach was perfect for us. We never had a problem getting lounge chairs even after sleeping in and could always find a flag to put up when we were hungry or thirsty. I have been craving the pina coladas since we left. The flags made us feel like royalty being waited on hand and foot. The servers were all wonderful and really gave the resort some personality. The staff had activities scheduled each day like Bingo, Crab races, swim races, water aerobics, etc. They were fun to play and we won tee shirts, champaigne, and rum! We met some wonderful friends there and plan on keeping in touch. We are all going back the same time next year. We did the all inclusive deal and had no regrets.", "title": "Awesome Hotel, Awesome Island", "helpfulness": 23, "user": "FishingdocNewYork", "date": "February 21, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3214302}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2005", "text": "We went snorkeling and had a great time. The sunset cruise was also one of our highlights. We did the timeshare presentation and it was very low key. No pressure at all. We have been through several and finally decided to purchase the timeshare at this resort. We can't wait to go back again this November. I am a very picky eater and hate to try new things. I like my french fries, pizza, hamburgers, steak, and bacon and eggs, and desserts and I was very happy with the selection and taste. They had a wide variety of island foods but also your everyday foods and they tasted just as I had hoped. Papa Don's was our favorite restaurant. The day we left we got a special treat and got our photo with Kenny Rogers. He was staying at the resort and was very casual with himself and everyone around. We took the helicopter back to the airport which was worth the money and saved us a lot of time. This was the best vacation that either of us have gone on. We have been to many others but we will definately be back to Windjammer Landing. Even though we planned on doing many things we never left the resort (except for dinner once) because we felt everything we needed was right there. I liked that we could use the U.S. dollar and everyone spoke English. One aspect of the island that I remember most is the people that lived and worked there and how friendly and helpful they were. They really appreciate the tourist there. I feel that this island is the Carribean's best kept secret. I highly recommend the Windjammer Landing for your next vacation.", "title": "Beach FINE, but worth the money?", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "bfactor", "date": "February 2, 2005", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0}, "id": 3112417}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We Loved It!!!", "text": "I just wrote a review but don't think it went through.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 1, 2005", "id": 3105220}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Windjammer - Excellent time", "text": "St. Lucia is a beautiful island with lush rainforest, beaches, mountains, and friendly people.

They are not! The room my daughters (28 and 24) were given was terrible. The bathroom was literally an outdoor add on. The toilet was by an open window onto the street although it did have bars! We complained and were upgraded to a two bedroomed villa with pool. The issue was superbly handled by Donna a managers assistant. Our second week was ruined by a group of 150 or more Americans in a wedding party. Typical \"herd\" behaviour loud, rude, brash and pushy. They dominated the beach, and the bar. They sunbathed on an inflatable trampoline meant for children. Families with children were driven from the bar at night as pushing and shoving got worse in proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Resort hotels should think very carefuly about booking big parties in family resorts: they just do not mix. The resort is in need of a face lift,we saw a huge diference between the timeshare and the hotel villas. Bathrooms are dreadful. food is excellent and the staff generally superb with one or two exceptions, mainly the younger femail staff who can be inflexible and sullen at times. Villa shuttle service is very good as is the concierge service with one exception who was completely wooden and robotic. Mosquitos are a nightmare but nets are provided over the beds. We went all inclusive and had very poor value for money having been driven from the public areas by the \"herd\". we even hired a car for 4 days to escape.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "woodydog", "date": "January 18, 2005", "id": 3014268}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2005", "text": "Not a bad resort but if you want a chill out holiday ensure that no large parties are booked in.
