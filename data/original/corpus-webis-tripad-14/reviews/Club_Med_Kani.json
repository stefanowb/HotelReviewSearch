This is the first time we traveled in Club med village and the concept of hospitality is quiet different then other 5-star properties. The staff is turbo charged to entertain us & help us out on any advise or suggestion ( among staff star performers were Andy, Kiki, Mr Singh, Brazilian salsa girl ( outstanding performance in Brazilian night) and none I other then village chief 'Daniel\" whose attitude towards guests is extremely warm, respectful & helpful. In short he gives a dash of personal touch to all guest members. We checked in Lagoon suite for 2 nights ( amazing experience once again) I would advise tripadvisor members to take up 4 nights, which ideally best way to experience Maldives.

Buffet is simple food and tasted good .. we adapt to the food after 2nd day and started to enjoy it very much and we luv the hospitality given by the GE ..Ali/Shazim and of course chef John. Cooking lesson is something i didnt expect for and I enjoyed it very much. Hubby went for snorkelling 2x a day for straight 3 days. He loves it and best thing is each time the excursion is at different spots. That makes it more interesting and looking forward each day. We also love the sunset bar, the band that serenade nice songs and she sang so well... at the pool initially i taught those music is from music machine not knowing it is someone singing it live at the bar!...great voice and really enjoyed it. At the Iru Bar...Andy is such a talented person and nice getting to know him too. Love the line dance/zumba dance with Andy, Singh and the rest of the GO.
