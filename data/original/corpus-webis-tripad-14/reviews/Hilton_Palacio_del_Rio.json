This hotel is very clean, quiet, modern, with lovely spacious rooms, great air-conditioning, and lobby staff that were second to none. This is an excellent spot to stay to take in all of San Antonio's city attractions. Just step out the door and you are on the beautiful Riverwalk. What a fabulous treat this is with its brightly colored umbrellas, awesome restaurants and bars, neat shopping spots, and beautiful flowers and trees. Across the street is the huge Rivercentre Mall, 3 full floors of shopping, great food court, and very clean. Also just down the street is the historic Alamo, a very beautiful area of the city. Across from there is a street lined with entertainment for the younger crowd, while around the corner from that is the fabulous Buckhorn Saloon & Museum, for the older crowd. Right next door to the Palacio del Rio is the La Villita, a historic artisan shopping area. You will find many beautiful handmade crafts in this area, including paintings, pottery, leather goods, jewelry, etc. Also make sure to take in the El Mercado, a Mexican shopping area of the city, and it was fantastic! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel, and were so glad that it was so close to everything we wanted and needed to see... plus many more things that could be mentioned here. Also the hop on- hop off open-air top bus stops right outside, so it was easy to get around the city, if not by foot :) Enjoy, we sure did!", "title": "Excellent stay at Hilton Palacio del Rio", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Culture-Shocked", "date": "July 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 169788319}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013", "text": "Stayed at the hotel over the weekend.

One very small hot tub; when referencing to front desk they say they do not have a heated spa, but the rules on the sign say \"Spa\" so they have a little uppity attitude. There were two couples in the spa and about 8 others wanting to get in and the look of disappointment as they arrived was very sad. The pool is not heated and they strictly enforce closure time. For such a large and bustling property they should at least have two spas, excuse me, hot tubs and don't even think of saying jacuzzi. The breakfast was very good and very expensive if you are not a preferred guest. Even with a gold status, there was confusion as to what could be ordered or conveniently accessed by the brunch buffet; their rules seemed silly and confusing.

You can exit the hotel at the bottom level and your'e right on the riverwalk and a short distance to the rivercenter mall as well.

On Sunday there weren't any waffles offered on the buffett so I asked the waitress and she had one made for us at no additional cost. The restaurant staff and check-in staff were very friendly and we were also able to get an hour late check-out upon request. My only complaint is the valet parking. There was nothing special going on that weekend and we'd planned to valet but circled around twice and had to get in a long line that formed outside of the hotel drive through that blocked the neighboring street. It was like a parking lot! We opted to find our own parking instead and parked for two nights at a safe garage right across the street for only $30 for the weekend! That saved us about $60 in valet parking, tax & tip. Great stay and we'd definitely stay here again if we opt to stay downtown.", "title": "Nice hotel with a great location!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DBHouston", "date": "July 23, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 168717232}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My daughter and I stayed in San Antonio at the Hilton Palacio Del Rio.
