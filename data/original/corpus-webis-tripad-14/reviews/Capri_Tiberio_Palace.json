It was NOT the case. We, too, were celebrating a milestone anniversary (30!), but did not receive a free room upgrade. However, the staff sent us a beautiful bottle of sparkling wine on the house and decorated the bed with rose petals. Our room was small, but lovely. In our experience, most hotel rooms in Europe are smaller than we might see in the US, so this was not unexpected. Our hallway lights did not flicker, our view was of a small terrace and the mountain beyond (not the sea or the trash bins). The room was beautifully appointed. I felt the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable. We ate at the hotel restaurant, White, and had one of our best meals in Italy. We enjoyed the sea view on the lovely front terrace. The JW's location was perfect for walking about Capri, visiting Anacapri and easy arrival from the harbor. Ask for harbor assistance ahead of time and Giovanni will meet you at the dock . He'll have tickets for the funiculare and explain about the baggage. We had him deliver the bags at 10 euros /each on the way to the hotel, because we really didn't know the ropes. The funiculare is a cable car which takes you up the Piazza Umberto I (1.40 euros pp). It was fun. When you reach the piazza, walk through the center and head towards the white arch at the back and to the left of the square. This is Via Le Botteghe. Follow it right to the JW. It is just a 5 minute walk down this charming lane. As we left Capri, we took our bags with us and rolled them down the lane, just like you see many people doing. We easily hopped on the funiculare and made our way down to the ferry. Enjoy Capri, the town is enchanting. Don't get all caught up in the quest to have the world's best seaview from your room. Capri. itself, is all about the views. If you must, be prepared to pay 650 euros for a seaview from your bed. Last of all, be sure to try the Lemon Granita Iced tea at one of the cafes in Piazza Umberto.
