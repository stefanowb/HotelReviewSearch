UPSIDE: Very comfortable. Very clean rooms with sparkling white bedding made up daily, room cleaned daily. Fresh towels on demand. Good hot water. Plenty of parking for your car (which you will want to have GPS included for ease of travel). Convenient to Amsterdam via bus #107 from Bunderstraat stop which is a 5 minute walk from hotel entrance. Bus runs every 15 min throughout day, every 30 min in late evening. Staff is cordial, helpful and professional. There is one complimentary internet access terminal in the main lobby and WiFi available. Great spot if you are golfer.
