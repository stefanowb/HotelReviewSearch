I read ALL the reviews on this site and my first reaction that I would love to say to many of the people on here is \"you get what you pay for\".

They try to make it nice by checking in at the lobby bar so you can have beverages and sit down, etc. but it was just a hassle. It took longer than it should have. Walking to your room can be very confusing because of the way the hotel is laid out. Our rooms were very nice though and big...great beds and bathroom. L'occitane bath products and other nice amenities. Our room was considered an \"ocean-front\"..but it really was an ocean view. This hotel is VERY big and confusing..there are so many restaurants and its hard to figure out which one to eat at for which meal. Breakfast was not relaxing at all..kids running around everywhere barefoot...just LOTS of kids. If you have no kids, or older kids who dont need constant entertainment, then you should not stay here. If you have kids, then this is a great place..there are so many activities (ceramics, cooking lessons, bonfires, etc.)..you can pretty much let them run around from breakfast all the way until dinner. There's 2 pools..one is supposed to be an adult pool but there were young kids swimming in it?? There were strict rules regarding lounge chairs ... but I would advise going out early to reserve some because otherwise it can be tough if you are there during the high season. There is a very nice beach and you can sit on the beach..it is also a swimming beach, which there arent too many in Cabo. Upon checkout, called for a bellman to get the bags..never showed up? Also, at your nightly turndown, you can request what kind of treat you would like (i.e. something sweet, salty, fruit, etc.)..which is a nice touch. If you are staying here, you know what you're getting. Overall it is a nice place to stay, and if you have kids who would like activities, then I would definitely recommend it. For a Hilton, it is definitely one of their nicer resorts. It is in a good location - in between San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas --about 20 minute drives to each, and about 25 mins. from airport.
