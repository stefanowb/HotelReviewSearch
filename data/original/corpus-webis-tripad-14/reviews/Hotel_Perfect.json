Staff was friendly and breakfast was actually really good for bread and coffee. Great balcony where you had an excellent view of a Parisian neighbourhood. Walking distance to Anvers subway station. Room was clean, along with the public washrooms we had to rely on as we did not have a toilet or shower in our room, however we also never had to wait to use these facilities. Beds were however on the small side, and is definitely one of the tackiest rooms I have ever stayed in.
