It\u2019s rustic native landscaping and local design is impeccable. The room (the Chisos Suite) was perfect and the attention to detail and d\u00e9cor was spot on. This guesthouse has the correct amount of amenities for it price-point and the staff was ready to provide what we needed. The coffee left on our doorstep both mornings was some of the best I\u2019ve had. The view from the patio is worth the entire trip\u2014the entire ghost town, the Chisos Mountain and the National Park is spread out before you. Be sure to complete your evening with a fire in the fire pit and a canopy of stars like you have never seen before. For the Big Bend this IS your top choice. You are in the center of the Ghost town and a pleasant easy walk to the Starlight Theater restaurant and the Terlingua store. (Fantastic eating and trinket shopping.) Be sure to stop in at the Boathouse for an afternoon brew and some interesting conversation with the \u201clocals\u201d. If you have not yet made a decision\u2014spend the money! Your second choice is not even in the class below.
