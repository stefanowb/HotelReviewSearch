For us it was the most relaxing and enjoyable of experiences.

We loved everything about it. After a busy week that took us to different places, we met at the Inn in separate cars. I arrived first - several hours before our room was ready. This wasn't a problem at all - I was directed to a cozy library near the front of the Inn, a cozy room with comfortable chairs, right next to a little kitchen with real coffee and snacks. We stayed in the Chelsea room - the one with the red tub and sink. It's bright, and cheerful, and just plain fun. David and Dora have style and character, traits that permeate everything about the Inn. They have done a lot of interesting things, love to share stories, but also know when to give guests space.
