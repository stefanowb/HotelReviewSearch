Rooms spacious and black and white stylish theme. Hotel staff friendly and helpful - International Boat Fayre was held on our weekend so very busy. Restaurant in Hotel not open for evening meals at weekend - Hotel recommended excellent restaurant close by called Lupos- a must for fish food gormets. Train station 2 mins across square great to take trip to Nervi (beautiful - and sometimes rugged - coastal area) along riviera and surrounding area. Lastly take a trip in the funiculor to top of Genoa from Santa Anna (5 min walk away) to top breathtaking views and only 1 euro return within 2 hours. Great value hotel in a beautiful city - airport only 10 mins drive away by taxi.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "genesta", "date": "October 25, 2003", "id": 1421440}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Convenient hotel near the station", "text": "The hotel was very convenient for the station, less than 2 minutes walk. The area around the hotel felt a bit seedy in my opinion. The room was of a good size and had a kitchenette area with a sink and hot plate but nothing to cook with! The bed was comfortable and the bathroom (with shower) was fine and of a reasonable size. There is a restaurant and bar downstairs and the breakfast in the morning was good with a wide range of hot and cold items. The hotel was being renovated when we visited (September 2003) probably before the city of culture.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Pippag", "date": "September 14, 2003", "id": 1283209}], "location": {}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 34, "average": 65, "very good": 80, "terrible": 21, "excellent": 36}, "slim_ranking": 0.505747126437, "detail_rating": {"service": 3.5, "cleanliness": 3.5, "value": 3.5, "sleep": 3.5, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.0}}
