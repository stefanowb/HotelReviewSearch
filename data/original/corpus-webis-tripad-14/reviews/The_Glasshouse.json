However, NOT a 4 star hotel. We arrived and the bedclothes were dirty and old, there was a large stain on the light green carpet in the middle of the room, the light green fabric chair was covered in stains, the curtain was hanging off the rail, we tried to fix but it was broken completely. The curtain was also stained. Granted the hotel is extremely busy, but its lack of care and attention to its decor and housekeeping leaves a lot to be desired. We did complain because lets face it, who wants to sleep in a dirty bed!!! The duty manager, Niall, was fantastic. He dealt with the situation very professionally. There were no free rooms so he had the room cleaned and bed re made with fresh sheets straight away. Apologised for the inconvenience, it was obvious he was completely embarrassed by the lack of housekeeping.
