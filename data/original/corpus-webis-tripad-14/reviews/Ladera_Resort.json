The entire island is amazing, but the Ladera resort really captures the best qualities of the country. Let me preface this review first by saying that the first 6 nights in Saint Lucia we stayed at a different, \"chain\" resort on the other side of the island. This resort was twice as expensive, and they called it \"all inclusive\". This other resort was extremely Americanized and it felt like I was still in the US.", "title": "This resort hits EVERY point!", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Katy G", "date": "November 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185406247}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "That was not the case at Ladera. When you are greeted and personally escorted to your room, it\u2019s like you're walking into a dream. We kept pinching ourselves and saying, \"oh my gosh. This cannot be real!\" The woman who escorted us to our room took the time to point out everything in the room, which came in handy! She told us that on Sundays (the day we arrived), they have a buffet with many authentic Saint Lucian foods. On our way to dinner, we were greeted by a sweet lady named Holly. She walked with us to the restaurant and gave us suggestions on what dishes to try. Being that we had been eating hamburgers, Japanese Hibachi, and pizza for the past 6 days, we were VERY interested. My favorite was the curried goat - but everything on my plate was delicious! I will say, it was a bit pricey, but we felt it was worth it! When we arrived back to our room, we found a chilled bottle of champagne and a hand written note from Holly ... the OWNER, which she failed to mention when we first met her. Wow... what a personal touch. Not a few words of greetings, it was a full handwritten note to me and my new husband wishing us a wonderful stay and a happy life together. It really touched our hearts. A continental breakfast is included. You can upgrade your breakfast by adding a couple dollars \u2013 which is totally worth it. And again, the food is authentic Saint Lucian dishes. Every meal we had at the resort was delicious. Internet is also available at no charge \u2013 that was very nice! We were able to facetime our family and friends and show off the beautiful room and view. They were SO jealous! The resort provides complimentary snorkeling gear. They have a shuttle that runs down to the beach 3 times a day. The snorkeling in this cove is better than the 2 scuba dives that we did at the other resort. There were so many different kinds of sea creatures. We saw squids, an octopus, as wells as thousands of fish!", "title": "Unforgettable Honeymoon", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Aymora", "date": "November 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185355401}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our room was just incredible.

There\u2019s a pool in every room. The pool is amazing with a little trickling waterfall to drown out any noises and give some privacy. The pool was very cold though. I think we only got in once\u2026 which was disappointing. There\u2019s a sun deck out over the forest. Just simply put: incredible. It seems the owner/staff have thought of everything. There was a fruit plate waiting for us when we arrived. There was insect repellant in the room, along with mosquito bite itch relief spray.

Ladera was once part of Rabot Estate, one of Soufriere\u2019s oldest plantations, which still borders the resort. In the late 1960\u2019s a parcel of land was sold and developed into a small cluster of condominiums and christened Dasheene, named after the thousands of large, glossy-leafed dasheen plants (also known as elephant ears) harvested on the site. In 1982 it was transformed into a unique resort and changed hands a number of times before emerging as Ladera under the current private ownership. The mission has always been to offer an unparalleled guest experience that is quintessentially Saint Lucian, one that embraces the magnificent views and offers harmony with the surrounding natural beauty and rich bounty of the island. Today, that commitment to sumptuous authenticity is evident in everything from the innovative renderings of fresh local dishes at Dasheene restaurant, to the use of Caribbean timbers, stone and tile work used in the guestrooms and public areas. Yet it shines through most effectively with warm and welcoming Saint Lucian staff."}
