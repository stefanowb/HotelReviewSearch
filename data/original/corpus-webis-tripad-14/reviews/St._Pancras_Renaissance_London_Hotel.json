The room was stunning, 20-25 ft ceilings, floor to ceiling arched windows, lots of light, wonderful bedding. These rooms were not originally en-suite when built in 1873, so they basically created a \"room within a room\" for the bathroom - but it worked well and the shower was wonderful. I would agree that some of the staff seemed rather new to the service industry (servers in the lounge, security detail), but the front desk staff and the head Chambers lounge staff were delightful. In addition to our room, the public spaces in the old part of the hotel were breathtaking - lobby, Booking Office, grand staircase, hallways, views into the lobby/rail station, Ladies Smoking Room and side room (these last two are private function rooms) were clearly renovated to their former glory with meticulous care. I did feel a little out of place in jeans in such a grand place - thank goodness it was just soft opening. Kings Cross location not withstanding, I envision this hotel becoming THE place to stay in London and host once-in-a-lifetime, memorable events. The hotel is not too long of a walk from Regents park or Camden area, and you can always pop next door to the British Library if you want to view the original Magna Carta [one of 4 or 6, IIRC] or Canterbury Tails.
