We spent 3 nights at Montpellier and are very delighted that we made the choice of staying at BW Eurociel. Very efficient, friendly, informative and fluent English-speaking reception staff who went out of their way to help. 10 minutes with luggages on foot from main gare. 3 stops by tram to airport shuttle bus, or if you are fit and do not have much to carry, by walking in 20 minutes or so. Very close to the new shopping mall too. A pity that we did not have breakfast there, which looked extremely attractive!", "title": "No wonder it is #1", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JJB", "date": "October 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 181773330}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good value for money", "text": "I agree with all the reviews, the room was very small no 43 but comfortable, clean and helpful staff. Bathrooms are good and great coffee machine in the room. Off street parking at \u20ac12 per day. It's an easy stroll to main shopping area and restaurants. The tram stop is very close but you have to walk up steep stairs or walk to the main square 5 mins away. At the price I would recommend it for a couple of nights.", "user": "Jill M", "date": "October 13, 2013", "id": 180757125}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is very clean, very neat, very handy in location, nice staff and nicely decorated but basic and with small rooms. The hand basin is in the room itself and the shower door opens straight into the room ie you have to come back into the bedroom area to dry yourself. This was fine on this occasion when I was travelling with my husband, but on other occasions I travel with my daughter or mother. This would not have been fine!
