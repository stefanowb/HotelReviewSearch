I am a wedding coordinator and was there working a wedding. I do weddings all over the state of Colorado so I have an opportunity to stay at many places. This was the second time I had stayed at Taharaa while working a wedding there. Both experiences have been nothing but positive. The Lodge itself is first class. A lot of thought went into building it. It is situated far enough from Estes that you feel like you are in the mountains and yet close enough for an easy trip into town. The views from the Lodge are magnificent! The guest rooms are well maintained. The room I stayed in had a gas fireplace on a timer so I could go to sleep with it on and a balcony that I could sit on to enjoy my morning coffee. Coffee and tea are left in each hallway every morning for early risers to enjoy. The owners are the innkeepers. They take immense pride in their place. The complimentary breakfasts are a real treat. Every morning they prepare something that delights all of the guests. Because I was there working I did not get an opportunity to enjoy the other amenities the Lodge has to offer but the wedding guests who were staying there took advantage of everything that was available.", "title": "A hidden gem in the Colorado Rockies", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Pepper080", "date": "February 3, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 13204809}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The best bed & breakfast Mountain Lodge", "text": "The area where wedding receptions are held is wonderful.

The lodge is beautiful and our junior suite was perfect. We were on the 1st floor with a huge balcony and a lovely fireplace. The lodge is far enough out of town you feel as though you are secluded, yet only a 5 minute drive to the heart of downtown. The hosts, Ken and Diane are lovely and Rocky (the dog) is a real cutie pie. Eric and Pam, the proprietors are fabulous and gave us some great advise as to where to eat and shop. The breakfasts were very nice and quite relaxing, too. In the evening they served wine/beer and the only complaint I would have with that is they should have offered something a little more substantial than mixed nuts to go along with the cocktails. Maybe a nice fruit and cheese tray. Especially since dinner is not served at the lodge and you are sometimes just too tired to venture out. Other than that, Taharaa was perfect and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone wanting a bit of luxury in the mountains.

My stay was excellent. The room was spacious, very clean and 'unfussy'. The bed was soft and comfortable. The bathroom was large with a separate toilet and a shower which was easily big enough for 2! The balcony was a lovely addition, each morning I stood out and breathed the lovely fresh air in, whilst watching the elks and miniature chipmunks running around. The view was over the small town of Estes Park and the mountains. There is a road beyond the Lodge boundaries but certainly not close enough (or busy enough) to be a problem. About the only thing I would add to the room would be tea/coffee making facilities. The Lodge does have good facilities in a kitchen set aside for guests to use, however early morning and last thing at night I'd prefer not to have to get dressed in order to get a drink. That said, it wasn't a big deal as coffee was available from 0730 in the hall. The Lodge itself was lovely, the sunroom and lounge areas were beautifully decorated and laid out. The wi-fi signal was strong throughout the lodge and (big plus) it was included in the room rate. The breakfasts were delightful, beautifully cooked and presented. Each morning there was a different selection of fruit, pastry/buns, along with a selection of yoghurts. Diane then personally cooked each main course to order - you can't get fresher than that! Each day had a different main course - pancakes one day, eggs benedict one day etc. Guests who are used to staying at hotels might prefer a choice of main courses and unrestricted times (breakfast started at 0800), but remember this is not a hotel but a lodge which is focussed on being personal and providing quality... and they certainly achieve that. Both Diane and Ken were friendly and made me feel welcome. On my first day I had a problem with a taxi to get me to the Stanley Hotel (where the training course was being held) not turning up on time - and Ken offered to drive me over. That's personal service and someone caring for his guests. Other facilities at the Lodge included a spa (which I didn't use) and ample car parking. My stay was also very quiet which is important to me - I wasn't even aware that other guests were there (except at breakfast) yet the place was fully booked. As someone who averages 150 nights a year in hotels I am well experienced in being a guest and in how hotels function. The Taharaa Mountain Lodge serves its target market very well and I would happily return.", "title": "Excellent Stay", "user": "SKA_York_UK", "date": "October 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20629580, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Unique and Individual", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a very nice time.

In actuality it is just off the highway and you can hear quite a bit of road noise. The view includes the highway and many houses, in addition to pretty mountains. The room and bathroom were fine but certainly not luxurious. We had the \"Rocky Mountain Jim\" room which had a king bed and was $185 plus tax per night including breakfast. The bathroom had ceramic tile and plenty of good lighting. The shower curtain had some mildew. I thought the bed was pretty comfortable but my husband found it too soft. I was surprised that the sheets were percale (50% cotton and 50% polyester); I found them quite scratchy. There was a prominently posted notice in the bathroom asking guests \"PLEASE\" not to use the towels or white washcloths to remove makeup. (Gee, how does every other hotel in the world manage to deal with this just fine?) The breakfasts were delicious -- eggs benedict, french toast with peaches, and breakfast burritos depending on the day. On our last morning the service was very slow and they delayed the start of breakfast service by a half hour (without extending it for an additional half hour). When I asked politely if there was any chance of checking out later than 11AM (on a Monday), the response was \"absolutely not\". Note that there is no restaurant on-site (let alone room service) and none within walking distance so you have to drive everywhere. There is no swimming pool, just a jacuzzi. Soap and shampoo were provided in the room but no conditioner. No coffeemaker or refrigerator in the room. This may be the best place to stay in Estes Park, and it is probably above average, but it frankly did not live up to my fairly modest expectations. I have stayed in Hilton Garden Inns at $75 per night that I liked better.

We typical never re-visit any places we've stayed at previously, but based on the December 2001 experience my wife and I had had here, there was no question, as I was planning this big Winter 2008 vacation, that we would re-visit Taharaa. I was a little concerned that, with the expansion they recently built, it might have lost some of its charm, but my concerns proved completely unfounded. Although we didn't have a chance this time to meet owners Ken and Diane, who were on their own vacation in Tucson, innkeepers Pam and Jimmy and their staff took fine care of us. My wife and I stayed in the same (and still quite lovely) Taharaa Suite we had last occupied, and my mother and kids got -- somewhat to my envy -- the very impressive new Cattle Baron Suite. The suites are large and well-appointed (though I was a bit surprised that, given the recent expansion, a flat-screen TV had not been added to the Taharaa Suite's bedroom to complement the only other (small) TV in the suite's sitting room -- basically meaning you can't watch TV from bed in that suite). The gourmet breakfasts were as scrumptious and filling as I had remembered, the views were spectacular, and it was obvious the entire place was being well maintained and cleaned. We had a great time (re-)exploring the area -- my kids and mother got a kick out of all the wildlife they saw -- and we had a fun time with shopping and eating as well as sledding at Hidden Valley. We had terrific dinners at Fawn Brook Inn and Dunraven's Inn, and an early burger dinner at Penelope's was pretty decent, too, though I'm not sure I'd agree with their advertising that it's the \"best\" burger I've ever had. :-) Whether you're visiting the Estes area for only a few days (as we did this time) or a whole week or longer (as we did last time, when we also had time to explore the areas beyond Estes), your only regret will come from not staying at Taharaa.", "title": "One of the few places we've visited a second time", "user": "afrinl", "date": "January 4, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23264303, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Classic mountain lodge with great views, well-maintained and clean, spacious, great breakfasts and hospitality", "disliked": "\u2014 The Taharaa Suite could use a TV viewable from the bedroom, but that's a pretty minor thing."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Our Special Place", "text": "We visited the Taharaa to celebrate our 19th anniversary.

Close to Estes Park and more importantly very close to the East side of Rock Mtn Park. We are avid hikers and wanted a convenient drive to and from the Park. We were greeted with warm smiles and friendly hand shakes and it just got better. The lodge itself is a mountain lodge theme with incredible decor and the whole lodge is immaculate. We immediately felt at home and relaxed after our hectic stay in Fort Collins. The rooms are theme rooms and our stay in the Lark Bunting room was great. The individual balcony overlooked the countryside and a view of the mountains, Elk and other wildlife. The king bed was very comfortable and the decor was outstanding. The facility has a wonderful area to lounge with other guests during a hospitality hour. There is a kitchen for the guests to use and that was quite convenient. There is an outdoor and an indoor hot tub which are very clean and well kept. NOW the best part is Diane's breakfasts. Her sweet potato pancakes with grilled fresh peaches on the side, are out of this world. The Eggs Benedict was the best ever. It's worth staying at Taharaa just to eat one of Diane's home made, cooked to order breakfasts. The presentation was perfect.
