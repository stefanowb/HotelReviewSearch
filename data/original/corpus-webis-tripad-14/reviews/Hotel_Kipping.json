The hotel is very convient to the main train station. You can easily walk there even with luggage. It is nice and functional and worth the price. The breakfast was also good. In the evening we walked back to the train station and then into the old town which begins right on the other side of the train station. We were pleasantly suprised by our short walk through Dresden. It is a very nice medium size German city which has been rebuilt. It would be worth a longer visit.", "title": "Functional and convient", "user": "Robbed_John", "date": "September 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 44556804}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I stayed at the Hotel Kipping one night as part of a Rick Steve tour.

It was glorious. Oh, and the hotel was well-located near the train station and the Innenstadt as well as the Strassenbahn stops. Our room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very good. Parking was free and the hotel was easy to get to from the Autobahn. The staff was friendly and helpful as we planned our sightseeing. Dresden is definitely worth a visit. Mostly German and East European tourists, not many Americans. You get a good perspective of what it was like before the war, after it was annihilated on 2/13/1945, how it was rebuiltas part of the DDR, and how it is regaining its former glory after the reunification. Don't miss the Historical Green Vault- what an opulent collection of treasures from Augustus der Starke and other Saxon kings. You must buy your tickets online many months in advance (go to www.dresden.de or do a Google search--we bought ours in Feb for June).
