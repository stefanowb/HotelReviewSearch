One of the most gorgeous resorts I have ever stayed in - I would have loved to stay here even if I wasn't participating in a yoga retreat. The resort is built into the jungle cascading down a hill to a small river. The rooms are laid out so that each feels isolated from the other rooms. The view over the rice fields is really beautiful. The pool is gorgeous and so refreshing. The spa is lovely. The staff are amazing. They all knew our names after the first day! The food is also to die for. Ubud town is a short walk or a free shuttle down the road. Could not fault this place.

The bathrooms are probably not quite at the standard of the rest of the retreat but they are perfectly adequate. All the staff were fantastic, great service and fabulous food.

Healthy and really tasty (and I wasn\u2019t expecting three course dinners every night...yum!). The spa treatments were also great, so relaxing and a great spa vicinity \u2013 the Mandi Lulur flower bath was a highlight. We had a lovely mix of people from around the world in our group which also added to the experience. Overall, the retreat really was fantastic \u2013 it exceeded my expectations in every facet and was also fantastic value for money. In addition, we really felt that the retreat was for us and that the team at OneWorld do all that they can to make sure that everyone enjoys their time there.
