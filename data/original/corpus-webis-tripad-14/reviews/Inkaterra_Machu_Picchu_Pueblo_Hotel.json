We made a fire and I had some of the provided Pisco brandy. We played cards with our friends in the bar. Dinner and breakfast were interesting but not the best we had in our stay. I did have cuy.

The grounds are beautiful with various types of gardens including an orchid garden. Hummingbirds abound. So plenty of exploring whilst not visiting Macchu Picchu. The restaurant food was excellent with breakfast being more than adequate. Staff were friendly and helpful. Only complaints are that reading light in the room was poor, especially for us older people at night, and the safety deposit box instructions were back to front in relation to buttons A and B. What really impressed us was the seamless arrangements for luggage upon arrival and departure. Our luggage was collected by hotel staff at the railway station and taken direct to the hotel while we boarded one of the many shuttle buses to visit Macchu Picchu. Then on departure the luggage was delivered direct to us at the railway station after we had passed another morning visiting magical Macchu Picchu.

The difference between the two hotels is like night and day (Inkaterra being the \"night\"). Although the setting of the hotel is attractive, the two rooms we were shown were shockingly small and spartan (and the bathroom was extremely basic). This hotel, even considering its \"naturalistic\" setting and atmosphere, in no way qualifies as a luxury property. The pillows in the room were cheap foam (with no feather available), there was no heat (other than by using the fireplace), the blanket was wool (not down). When calling for service by telephone, we received a consistent \"busy\" signal for more than 10 minutes. The bellman brought us to the wrong room and did not even have the key. We had to sit on the steps and await his return. We did not consider the meals to be among the better dining experiences we had on our trip (especially in conrast to Tambo del Inka and the restaurants in Cusco). If we had been paying $200 per night, we might not have been disappointed but at $600+ (including breakfast and dinner), we felt that we had been robbed. Tambo del Inka in the Sacred Valley was less than half the price, the rooms were truly luxurious, the food was wonderful, and the staff was helpful and friendly. We only wished that we had been returning there after our Machu Picchu excursion. Inkaterra has a captive audience (with only a couple of other hotels to compete at Aguas Calientes) and they are truly taking advantage.
