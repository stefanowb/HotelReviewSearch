The rooms are standard but very clean and it is nice to have two sink areas when staying with two people. The bed was very comfortable--down comforter and lots of pillows. TV is small. Room service offers a fairly good selection but as always, a bit pricey. We had a room on the 23rd floor and the view of downtown was great. Try Breadwinners cafe and bakery on McKinney for brunch or breakfast, its a great cafe/lunch place that tons of locals seem to frequent. You will have to wait but it was worth it. The only (-) of this hotel was that the lobby smelled strangely like beef. This is because of the steakhouse on the main floor but it is a weird combination of hotel cleaner smell mixed with beef every time you walk in....maybe they could get a better venting system in that restaurant. Other than that it was a great hotel and I would stay there again. Also--free parking. Get a rental car or you will feel isolated.
