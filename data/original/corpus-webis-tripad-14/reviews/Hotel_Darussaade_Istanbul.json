What we like most about the hotel is the location, within walking distance to the Blue Mosque and other attractions. The room is small but cozy and equipped. We got a room on the third floor, so the view was nice (sea view). The only comment is for the lack of elevator (esp. for the luggages). Nevertheless, you can ask the hotel staff to help you. The staff are very friendly and helpful esp. a staff called Omer. There's a reasonable priced convenient store right opposite of the hotel too. It's definitely a nice place to stay if you want to be closer to main attractions...a nice place to rest after a long day exploring the magnificent Istanbul.", "title": "Warm and cozy place", "user": "Jakky_P", "date": "April 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 104367549}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "This is a hotel you'll wish to come back to!

We were really happy with the location and the hotel was charming, tastefully decorated to a very high standard.

I can basically echo the same sentiments as all the other reviews: great location for seeing the sights, small but comfortable rooms, very small bathrooms, good breakfast, etc, etc\u2026 But, what I was most appreciative was the accommodating staff. We had an issue with our room one night. A strange and unpleasant odor filled our room at around 1am. The gentleman at the desk immediately got us another room to sleep in (we didn\u2019t have to move our stuff) and called someone to fix the problem the next morning. Unfortunately, they needed to do a bit more extensive work to fix the problem so, the staff moved all of our belongings for us into another room. They were so helpful and quick to resolve the problem! Because of the inconvenience they paid for our taxi ride to the airport which was very kind of them.
