Typically at Hamptons you are greeted multiple times a day when you encounter the staff members. The staff at the desk had their heads down looking at the computer screen and didnt notice there was someone waiting to check in nor did they notice I was lost.

Breakfast is included and is wonderful, especially the delicious waffles and sausages! WIFI is free and our rooms had two flat screens TV\u2019s with a full menu of movies and channels. The hotel grounds are attractive with extensive water features and a nice pool and Jacuzzi area. Staff is professional, helpful and courteous. The hotel rates are a real bargain to boot! The hotel is centrally located within easy access to everything in Manteca. I highly recommend this hotel as the best available in both Manteca and Stockton.
