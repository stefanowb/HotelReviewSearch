Quiet and peaceful. Hairdryer in room. Lovely pool view from balcony of room 515. Big room with large bathroom. Toiletries are not expensive ones. Two free bottles of water per day. Safe works and is large enough for a smaller laptop. A/C can get a little noisy at times but it works well. Get your laundry done here; low prices compared to everywhere else. Room lighting is a bit dim. Americans won\u2019t need an electrical adapter. King of Mongolia also staying at this property the first night of my stay. Slow dinner service in the restaurant; OUR tour staff was serving and clearing! Housekeeping seems to come later in the day. Bar and minibar prices are high. Hotel has a generator for power backup; it did go on at least a couple of times during my 3-night stay. Staff at breakfast is not good about clearing and re-setting tables for those coming next. I lost my hat one day on the way out, and the front desk had it for me when I went looking later in the day.
