My daughter even had her wedding and reception here. While the prices are pretty high, the rooms are very nice. When it came to checkout, we were double charged. We argued with the manager at the desk, who told my sister to shut up. The police were called in and we were threatened to sign the credit slip or we would be arrested (on charges of theft). This is not the kind of service we expected after all the times we've stayed. We will just have to go through the trouble of disputing the extra charges, but we will not be recommending this hotel anymore.

We took the elevator and kicked empty cans of bud into the corner.. ominous we thought. The room was reasonable..not big not small clean and comfy. The bathroom was ok but clean too. We unpacked and went down to the bar....this resembled a small works canteen...and served as the restaurant too....we went out. We should have stayed out. At 9.30 the whole town seemed to erupt into a night club. We could not only see the clubs and bars but could hear them blasting. Even with the windows closed...Double panes would have been useful. This lasted till 2.00 heavy metal and blues...Then came the finale...the car park seems to be used by everyone visiting Folsom...swearing drunks are not funny. Fortunatly we could see our car.
