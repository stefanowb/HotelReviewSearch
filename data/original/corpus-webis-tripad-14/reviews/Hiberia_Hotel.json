The President''s house is right next door, so the security is guarranteed, and the Trevi fountain is two minutes away. The colosseum and historic rome is a10 min walk away, and so r the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navona. Other than the superb location, the hotel is very clean, neat, and designed to impress. The breakfast is also great, especially with a cup of real cappuccino! The receptionists are very friendly and helpful, and room service is very good, too.

Once check-in is over and you are handed the keys to your room, everything changes. I was shocked when the porter led us through a sliding door into the adjacent building which, according to him is 300 years old. By the looks of it, it didnt look like anything had been done to fix this place for 300 years!!!! It was dark, smelly and quite frankly I knew right away we made a mistake. I know and have been told that in Rome hotels are all quite old (my mom stayed at the Intercontinental a few months ago and she even said that was old and the room very small) but this was shocking as it did not seem well maintained at all. First of all, the elevator is the oldest i have ever seen....you need to close the gates and then the wooden doors for it to start. That was also very smelly. Our room was dark, dusty (i ran my finger across the desk and couldnt believe my eyes!) and it just simply made our stay uncomfortable. The bathroom is old and so noisy, it takes the toilet forever to become quiet again after you flush it.... using it in the middle of the night was very annoying especially because my husband and I kept waking each other up. The breakfast is also THE WORST breakfast we had in all of Italy. We had breakfast there the first morning and after that horrible, tasteless experience we ate breakfast at cafes for the rest of our stay.

The location is very central but I think you could do a lot better. The hotel occupies a narrow site - seating downstairs in 'lounge' was along a bench- so no proper central lobby. Our room was on the top floor. The lift is one of the old metal cage types - fine if it is working but it was out of order during part of our stay. Luckily I am pretty fit as the steps are very steep - not good for small kids.! The room was small - not uncommon for old central Rome., but a squeeze for a double and two singles. Nothing to warrant the 'deluxe' label - at first I thought they had made a mistake as it didn't really correspond to the description on the website. We had a 'jacuzzi' in the small bathroom which my kids liked but afterwards the bath was filled with small flakes of black film from the water pipes. Breakfast downstairs was pretty poor - no pots of coffee or tea but a self-service vending machine, the bread stale, the 'fresh' orange juice more like bitter squash.
