A late 1800\u2019s railway theme with authentic memorabilia evokes images of a time when life moved more slowly, more gently. Eight beautiful suites feature handmade beds draped with mosquito nets, soft linens and antiques. En-suite bathrooms (recently refurbished) have indoor and outdoor showers. Excellent cuisine is enjoyed in the small farmhouse kitchen or intimate outdoor boma and viewing decks overlook a riverbed."}
