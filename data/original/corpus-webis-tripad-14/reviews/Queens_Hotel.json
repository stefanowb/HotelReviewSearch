I asked for a quiet room as I understand that many people have said that they have stayed in rooms facing onto a night club and it's very noisy. My room is on the 4th floor and is part of the roof so it's a weird shape. The floor also seems to be at an angle, sloping in different places and has an uneven floor. And even though there is little street noise, as it's breezy the roof slates rattle so it certainly isn't quiet! The room is ok. It could be cleaner- there are roof hairs in the bed, black bacteria around the sink and bath, and the bathroom floor has the same kind of lino that public toilets have on them. The general deco is tired and could do with a kick of paint and thorough clean. As a short person I found it very difficult to climb in and out of the bath to have a shower so if you Gav mobility problems, you have a problem! I paid \u00a375 a night for bed and breakfast. If this is the room rate then for 2 people its good value. If it is per person, I would save your money and stay elsewhere as there is simply no way that it is worth \u00a3150 a night. However,this hotel is in a grate location on the seafront minutes walk from the pier, shops and restaurants and the royal pavilion.
