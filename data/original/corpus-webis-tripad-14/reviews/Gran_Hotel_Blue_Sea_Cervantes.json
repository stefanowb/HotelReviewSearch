The room was a decent size, beds were hard but very comfortable for me - slept great! The pillows were extremely comfy too. Room was clean and cosy. Nice bathroom with bath and shower with great water pressure. The balcony was a good size and we had a room facing the pool - we got the sun in the morning, so the afternoon was cooler - but that was fine for us. We were on the second floor, the noise from the pool area was quite loud if we left the balcony doors open, but when they were shut you heard virtually no noise - even at night with people sitting outside drinking and partying a little. The only downside with our room was that the fridge and safe didn't work - no bid deal really. The hotel wasn't overly busy until Thursdays - thursday through to Sunday evening was very busy as this is when the Spanish come for weekend breaks. They are noisy and quite annoying with the lifts - holding them all the time. That said, the lifts were annoying anyway - 4 lifts that fit 8 people in each - we gave up waiting for them very soon in the week seeing as we were only on the second floor - I wouldn't like to have been on the 7th and walking up every day!!", "title": "Nice hotel, friendly staff", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Annmarie3362", "date": "March 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126055615}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled solo", "text": "The hotel has two pools, the garden and roof terrace - both were freezing but that comes with the time of year.

I didn't like most as they don't cook it long enough so the chicken is quite jelly/rubbery like and the pork was undercooked (my piece was, that's not to say everyone's was).
