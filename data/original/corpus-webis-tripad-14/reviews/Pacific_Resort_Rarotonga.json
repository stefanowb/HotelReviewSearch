But you must save your moo-la to go to Raro, as it's unreal the prices in which you have to pay. The resort where we stayed was set in the most natural lush surroundings and it was just perfect. Things that weren't perfect was how much we had to spend for our poolside room which was very basic and somewhat dated. Comfortable but the room does not match the price. We got room service one night and that was the last time, I ordered a $15 cheese platter, which stated a selection of crackers, dried fruit and nuts. I got 4 water crackers, 4 sticks of chedder chees, a big hunk of blue vein and a sloppy hunk of partly melted camenbert, 3 dried dates and about 6 walnuts and 6 peanuts!! We also ordered a $6 side of fries, the bowl was covered with tin foil so by the time it got to our room, they were soggy and hard!! And above all of this we were charged $5 for the staff to walk 200m to deliver it, so we opted to pick it up. The restaurant at the resort also did not match the price with the food served. The breakfast each day was great though, really enjoyed the fruit. I was shocked to leran that a staff member who has worked at the resort for 11 years, is on a whopping $7 hour!! It just doesn't seem fair!! We stayed for 12 nights in rarotonga and that was long enough, 7 nights would of been better. I enjoyed the lagoon, the flowers and fruit and the pigs, dogs and chickens you see all over the island. A lot of the locals weren't very inviting but the staff at the resort were really friendly, so it was very pleasent in that respect. I just about fell over when going to the supermarket and a 6 pack of fresh and fruity was $11.75!! A 600 ml of milk was around $10!! A big bag of chips will cost you around $6.50!! To go out at night for a decent meal and one that you will enjoy will cost you around $100 for a main each and a dessert to share and 1 drink each. So expect to spend btween $100 to $200 on food per day. You also have to pay for your water. Whether you get a glass eating out or at a mini mart. We spent around $70 on water whilst we were there. I recommend going to the super market and getting a box of pump water for $30, at least this way you can have it in your fridge and take it out with you each day. (you cannot drink tap water as it is not treated). loved the cultural dancing and the markets and the heat. For such an exclusive island and holiday destination I was shocked at how run down a lot of the town looks and they need to invest some of our tourist money in some rubbish bins!! I'm appreciative of the experience and I feel for the locals in the struggle they have to make money. Places to eat in which I loved was Sails, The Point, The Indian Restaurant and Stefanos Italian restaurant. Tangaroa tours is great too, a 4wd drive tour run by Ups and Arama (two awsome cute guys, who are funny and enlighten your knowledge of raro). A hire car is REALLY handy!! Definately check out the sunset at the edgewater hotel, amazing!!

On our previous trip we stayed at what was described as a budget style resort - yet were pleasantly surprised. This time we decided to treat ourselves and stay at the acclaimed Pacific resort - we were highly disappointed. We were in a 1 bedroom poolside unit with \"kitchen\" facilities. Do not stay in these units unless you are prepared to spend a lot for a poorly equipped, drab, dated and dirty unit. The kitchen cooking facilities consisted of a dirty oven and cooktop, jug, toaster, one pot and one fying pan. There was no where to store anything and the cutlery on offer was dirty and nothing to even prepare a snack in. We paid almost $400NZ per night for this unit and after 2 nights asked to be moved to a garden studio at an additional $165.00NZ per night. Yes we agree with all who have commented on these studios - they are very nice and new. But at almost $600NZ per night they are highly overpriced and we had more value for money on our previous trip. At the very least we feel a queen bed when specified should not consist of 2 single beds being pushed together. At $600NZ per night the air conditioning should at the very least work and not require the services of a repair man at 5pm in the afternoon when guests have waited a good part of the day to first move into the garden studio at 2pm. We also felt in terms of the Pacific experience Samoa was superior. Vanuatu also offered value for money.
