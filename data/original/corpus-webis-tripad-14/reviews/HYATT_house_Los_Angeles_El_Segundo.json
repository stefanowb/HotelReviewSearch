For the price we paid, it wowed us. Exceptional Service! All staff are super friendly and do everything they can to whatever we need. The room is clean, I give it 4 out of 5, there are several small things that are not superb, but overall very satisfied. The rooms are a bit small for a group of 7, there are not enough desk space and the washrooms are a bit tight. But that is not their fault as not many choose to squeeze 7 people in one place! Breakfast is great, with a good variety, staff keep refilling the food. We tried one social night and thought it was very good as well, food quatity never went low. Gym is small but clean and spacious. My friends enjoyed the pool a lot. The downside is there are no elevators, so we had to take our luggage up the stairs. But it didnt bother me too much. and I wish they provide shuttle to the LAX airport. I see they do grocery shopping for you as well, but I never tried.", "title": "Great Choice", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jodcha", "date": "October 23, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119611856}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I am impressed with this hotel.

Complimentary breakfast contains two different kinds of melon, yogart, porridge, scrambled eggs, sausage/ham, potatoes/waffles, bagels, toast, fruit juices and tea/coffee. They also provide a social hour Mon through Thurs with free wine/beer and light bites(free) Rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. Safety deposit boxes are provided at reception and that is also free as is the gym, parking and internet. The pool was a lovely temperature and the jacuzzi was as warm as bath water. There is a room with two computers with internet access and a guest laundry. They charge $1.50 per washing machine load and the same for drying. The machine takes quite a large amont of washing, so nice not taking home all the dirty washing! Would highly recommend this place to anyone.

This was not an exceptionally clean hotel. Seems like floors had not been vacuumed from prior guest. I asked housekeeping to run the vacuum and they never did it! Sheets always fell off of beds! Breakfasts were good, standard. Afternoon snacks were just OK. Room cards would not work after first day, had to go to desk to have them reactivated....same thing happened next day after breakfast. This is extremely inconvenient and frustrating after arriving at the room after a full day's touring. TV's were flat-screens with good reception.

Another downside is there is not elevator - if you don't ask for help you may have to carry your bags for two floors.
