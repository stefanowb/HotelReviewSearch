I provided them with my price range (under 80 euros) and this was one of the recommendations. For 69 euros, I received a typical single bed room in a very nice hotel. The hotel property and room were very clean and the staff was very pleasant. I believe you had to pay all of 2 euros for a wi-fi connection...a very reasonable price! The off-street parking cost 2 euros/day...a bargain! They were just a short walk away from the lovely downtown.

That\u2019s the way it is with us.Where we are: right in the middle of Roman Trier, there where the forum was. What we are: whole-hearted hosts. You can see that from our many loving details. You can feel that from the careful way we create atmosphere. And you can even taste these details: it\u2019s not just our jams that are homemade. It\u2019s the personal accents that make the difference. That\u2019s why our guests return again and again."}
