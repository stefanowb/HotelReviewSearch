The thing I noticed about the buffet, is that the food was ALWAYS HOT, if it wasn't, you simply notified the staff, and they would bring fresh batches within seconds. Another key to a good buffet, is to have fresh stations....they had fresh omelet stations, tortilla stations, grilled meat stations, etc. If you cant find good food here you like, you have a problem.
