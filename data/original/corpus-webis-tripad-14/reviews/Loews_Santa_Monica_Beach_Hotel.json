The rooms were nice with good views (although you would need to be up high for that). All services were fine although none were exceptional. The locations is great for the beach but not for the town so much. All in all a good hotel to stay in if you need access to LA, and especially the airport which is only 20 mins away, but want to stay on the beach. Also considerably cheaper than Shutters just down the road.", "title": "Nice Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "August 20, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3791864}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Incredibly bad value and mis-leading website", "text": "Whoever designed the website did a fantastic job because its nothing like the reality of the place.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Freddy22", "date": "August 12, 2005", "id": 3757108}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "Firstly, this hotel is not on the beach.
