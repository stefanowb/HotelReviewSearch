The rooms are good sized and very comfortable. Huge bathroom! No closet or hanging space however, but instead a free standing wardrobe /amoire which limits you in closet space. Difficult when not traveling alone. This property is more\u201dresorty\u201d and appears that it caters to business travelers more than families visiting Disney. There are extra charges for everything which are common at most other establishments in the area (despite what the management says) such as in room fridge and wifi. Items such as fridge and/or microwave are essential when traveling with young children and cost the company next to nothing to provide, yet they really stick you for the daily cost. Free wifi is available if you want to use their services in the lobby, allbeit extremely slow, however it is $10/day for wifi service in your room. Really??? That is ridiculous. No breakfast is included with your stay here as in most family oriented establishments today, particularly in the Disney area. Breakfast is available however for preferred SWG members at the \u201cClub\u201d and also for a price in the lobby restaurant which was less than desirable. The Donut/Pastry shop down the street was great! We stayed here ONLY because it had been pre booked and pre paid with Disney tickets through an outside travel company, otherwise we would have left after the first night. As our stay continued for four nights we learned a few other things. Housekeeping is very busy and often forgets to restock your room with clean towels and glasses. We also found a dirty Q-tip on the floor underneath the desk when we arrived\u2026..apparently too busy for thorough vacuuming too. The shuttle to Disney was outstanding and works very hard to be accommodating. The shuttle employees were always very prompt and courteous. This establishment does not cater to families whatsoever. . It would be a great value if booked through an online booking company for a reduced price, but definitely not worth paying their \u201cmarket\u201d price.
