My first point: this is a very nice Homewood suites. It's new, modern, and the rooms are stylishly well appointed. Excellent kitchenette, flat screens in each room, very trendy sinks, baths and otther touches. Lastly, if you are a fitness lover you just found Mecca. Forget the workout room where the furniture was taken out of a room and treadmills are rolled in. This hotel -and a couple of others nearby- give you free access to a very spacious and modern health club thats connected to the hotels all sharing the same building.

It's an oasis of the city. Upscale, spacious, numerous restaurants of all ends, pubs, recreation, and tourist spots.

The Internet service is slow. I'm a network engineer so trust me this isn't u.s.e.r error. The hotel cable channel line up is pretty slim. I've gotten far more in small town motel chains. I'd expect more from an icon like this hotel. Lastly the check in/parking can get a little frustrated. The hotel is on one side of a divided 4 lane road that you have to go around a beautiful fountain rotary to get to. The check in parking area is tiny as it can be shared by cars that are parked on either side of this small pull up that are at a connected but separate restaurant. When I drove up ther ws no where to park just to check in. And so you have to drive allt eh way around again to the rotary or around a couple of blocks to get back around hoping a spot will open up just to check in. It can be very frustrating, especially on a Sunday evening. Have your bags ready because the regular parking area is behind the hotel in a connected parking garage that holds condo owners and guests of the Homewood suites and the Hilton Garden Inn. Also the parking is expensive. Its $25.00 a day or $195.00 for a 1 month pass.

I have been staying in Baltimore while out of school for summer break. I arrived at Hilton Garden on Thursday May 7, 2009. I thought that this location was beautiful and that I would truly enjoy my stay. However since here, I have been treated very rudely! I will only mention the incidents that have really truly upset me. I must advise that I checked out for the first time since May 7 on May14 because of the rudeness from Donna the manager at the front desk, but the location I moved to was not what I was looking for. I wanted to be close to the water and I flew in, so I needed to be somewhere where everything was in walking distance, which the Homewood Inner Harbor location suited me perfectly. Sometimes I want a good home cooked meal while away from home, and here I can cook, and everything is very convenient. Well, I checked back in on Friday the 15th paying 195.00 covering me until Saturday morning. Saturday morning I enquired about the rate, and it was 139.00 plus tax, so I paid 300.00 to cover me until Monday the 18th. Sunday night I received a call from Donna the manager saying I needed to come down and pay. I explained to her that I already paid. She said, \"no you need to come down and pay, or else I will have to have security come down and escort you out of your room. I then (with a little extra bass in my voice) said that I have already paid, and you are dead wrong, and I will need an apology tomorrow, and I will be contacting the manager! She then said \" I guess we'll just have to send you some more free stuff!!! I was completely floored! I then decided that these calls needed to be recorded just in case they did put me out 6 hours away from home in a room that I had paid for, than that was completely grounds for a law suit! I then called back and Skylar answered the phone. I tried to explain to her that they were wrong in a very calm manner She would not agree even after I completely explained how, when, and who I paid! They also disconnected my phone not allowing me to call out. This a.m. when I woke, I went downstairs and requested the manager contact me because I was still very upset, even now writing this, I am fuming! I called and called for the manager, My call finally reaching him at 2 p.m. He told me he would speak to Scott TOMORROW! Are you kidding me???? And also, for me to lay down and get some rest or go out and get some fresh air! Really, what is that supposed to do?!. I called back down when 2nd shift got here actually trying to give one of these ladies a chance to apologize. Skylar answered,. and I said \" So, you guys were wrong!\" She did not apologize, but did admit that I was caught up on my room last night while being harassed at 10:15 p.m. I do have taped phone calls on my cell phone. My mother taught me very well! I document and record everything. I then asked for corporate number, she said 1-800-HILTON. After calling that number and seeing that was not enough numbers, I then called back up front and Donna answered. I then told het that I would never need anything for free, I have paid more e money in my room than what she makes in a month and I will never need anything for free, after all my house isn\u2019t sitting in a puddle! I said this because no manager has taken care of this issue, and they have been able to say what they want to me, no manager has stepped in, so obviously I need to step up and say something! I was almost in tears last night- tears of anger, humiliation, and I am still extremely upset! I have spoke to Katrina from corporate and she was in disbelief, she gave me several apologies, which I can't say for the hotel. She has promised that both ladies will formally apologize to me this week, and I can't wait! Karma is something! I will write my reviews and pass this on to whoever until this issue gets solved!

Overall our experience was very good and we wished we were staying another night. The room was very nice - and very clean. The kitchen was updated, clean, and had everything you would need if you wanted to cook, a big fridge, plus a kitchen bar with 2 seats. The big screened tv rotated, so you could lay in bed and watch, or turn it around to face the living room area. The bed was very comfortable, although I didn't care for the light fluffy pillows (I personally prefer a more weighted, heavier pillow). The only thing about the layout of the room I didn't like was the bathroom/vanity area. The bathroom had the shower and toilet in it, but the sink/mirror is outside the bathroom in the vanity area. While I was getting ready in the morning, at the vanity area, I had to turn the lights on, which are very bright and woke my 20 month old and husband. There is no door separating the vanity area from the bedroom area. I personally like to have privacy when getting ready and would prefer for there to be a door there ( at least just for keeping the bright lights from others sleeping still). That was really the only thing I didn't like. I loved the complementary hot breakfast in the morning. We ate so much, we actually skipped lunch that day. They had everything you could want - eggs, bacon, sausage, some kind of grits, potatoes, oatmeal, cereal, milk, coffee, fruit, yogurt, tea, juice, bagels, toast, muffins... We got down there early and it wasn't busy at all. They even brought out a high chair for our little one. After breakfast, we headed to the aquarium ( about 5-10 min. walk). We requested a late checkout and they said we could check out at 1:00. (12:00 is the usual checkout time). You are allowed to keep your car in the lot until 4:00 pm without getting charged additional $ too, which is nice if you want extra time to do whatever you want, without having to worry about moving your car.

She said not a problem and she would mark it on our reservation and call housekeeping to confirm. With this, my family embarked on our way to the Inner Harbor. When we returned at 1:45pm to check in, there was a different gentleman at the desk, we checked in and asked about the cribs. He was also pleasant and professional and stated that he did not see them on the reservation, but he would call housekeeping to make sure that our request would be filled. A little annoyed but assured, we went up to the room so that our twins could take their afternoon nap. They slept on the floor, but my wife made sure and slept right beside them for safety. They had just begun to walk, so we did not want them wandering in the dark if they woke up early. After nap, we decided to leave for dinner. We decided to check one more time to make sure that the cribs would be in the room when we returned so that the twins could go to bed. Another woman was at the front desk. This time she stated that there were no available cribs in the entire hotel. There was no apology, no empathy, not even an \"I'm sorry\".
