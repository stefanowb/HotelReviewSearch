Once I was at the desk waiting to check in the young man was on the phone and I over heard him bad mouthing what seemed to be another hotel in the area. Very tacky, especially considering the source, I mean his hotel really had no room to talk about any other hotel. So once I was checked in and went up to my room, first I would like to say WOW!!! and not in a good way. The carpet was very old and outdated it had spots and stains, the tv was old, the beds were so uncomfortable. It was not at all what I was expecting. I have stayed at the Wingate in warner robins and it was very nice, I have stayed at the Fairfield Inn and it was great, I also stayed at the Candlewood on my last visit (BRAND NEW) that hotel was really nice. They were sold out on my most recent trip which is why I was stuck at the Hampton. I usually am a hilton loyal vip diamond member but when you are in warner robins there are just so many new hotel that you have to try them all out.

There's a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts & IHOP..go there. 6) NOISE.. OMG.. the walls are paper thin and we heard babies crying and doors slamming hard throughout the night.
