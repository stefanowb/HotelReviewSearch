We thought the hotel was very near the airport and would be easy to find after we had given back our hire car. It was not. We spent an hour driving around the suburbs trying to find it - after asking twice by phone how to find it, and at two garages - and we have University degrees! Part of the trouble is that the hotel does not have a fluorescent sign at a high level, as we expected - we saw Ibis & Novotel - also there are no indications that we could see. Eventually we found it, dropped off our luggage, returned our car and took a bus back. We did not know there was a bridge and were nearly killed crossing the motorway. The next day we took a taxi. It cost 15 euros! As it was New Year's Day we were charged double for our meal! That is to say, the menu was \"unavailable\", but we were given exactly the same food - at twice the price. Also, breakfast was included but as we had an early flight this was impossible, so we asked if we could have a drink & a cake to take instead. This was refused, even though there was an automatic machine selling these, so it would have been easy for the staff to provide.", "title": "Cheap: yes, convenient: not very", "user": "JuliannaLees", "date": "January 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 122915023}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "It was cheap.

It is about a 20 minute walk to the airport. Although we would recommend taking a taxi because if you walk you have to run across some very busy highways. The cost of the taxi for us at 5am was \u20ac14. The hotel was equipped with a restaurant and every kind of vending machine possible. The staff spoke English and they were at the desk 24/7. Our biggest complaint was that WiFi was not free. We had to pay \u20ac3.50 for an hour of WiFi to check into our flight. The rugs were also quite stained and worn. Our towels in our room were stained and we had to go ask for new ones. The shower was warm but the pressure would go way up and then down to just about a drizzle. The walls are also very thin. Our neighbors kids were yelling and screaming all night.

Its close proximity to the airport is perhaps its greatest asset, especially if you have a super early morning flight. It is located at the exit immediately before the airport exit, so getting to the airport from this location is super easy and a no brainer if you're driving. Although the hotel has a \"newish\" look from the outside, the inside needs a bit of upgrading. The carpeting throughout the isles is heavily stained, which gives you an uneasy feeling. This is truly an economy hotel, so you really cannot expect a higher standard. The rooms are clean, but you tend to get that \"unclean\" feeling. The bathroom sinks are tiny and round, but the bathroom is reasonably large enough to not feel super cramped. Water tends to splash out when showering. While it has a thermostat for temperature control, we turned on the coldest setting only to get a blast of hot air. Although it was late December, the room was a bit warm. Opening the \"swivel\" window allows fresh air in, but you get the loud roar of the traffic from the main road next to the hotel. Breakfast service (included in the price) begins at 7:30am, but we were not able to enjoy the food because of our early flight. The gal at the check in counter did say they would have self serve coffee and yogurts available prior to 7:30am. The staff were very corial and polite. I even asked if I could have some self serve yogurt in the evening, since I was not going to enjoy the morning breakfast, and she said I could help myself. We were able to get a good nights rest, and the TV alarm sounded as programmed. The location of this hotel made our arrival at the airport very stress free, but I definitely would not recommend this hotel for anything other than a one night stay for an early flight, or a stop off point on a long drive. Parking is free, so that's an additional asset. There are some large shopping centers pretty close to this hotel.", "title": "No words", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "fabybona", "date": "December 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 121675052}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Worst hotel ever.

However, I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived before official check in time and was able to gain immediate access to my room. The reception staff were very friendly. The room was a typical HIE standard and experienced absolutely no problems whatsoever - no disturbance by aeroplane noise seeing it is fairly close to the airport. Getting there from the airport was very easy - take the number 19 bus from the arrivals at the airport and it is the first stop. At the bus stop there is a blue bridge crossing the busy main road and then a 200 yard walk. The same bus (and 2 others) can be taken to the city centre which are frequent and only take 20minutes again for 1.20 or 2 Euros dependent on which bus you get. The 'A' bus (stop outside the hotel) takes you back to the airport for 2 Euros so no 20 Euro taxis! Our stay at the hotel was relaxing and the decor is pretty good. The only one improvement I would suggest to the hotel is having better quality towels.
