We arrived at the Oakland Airport and took BART to get to SanFrancisco and then the f-line muni to get to Fisherman's Wharf. It was ok, but it took a good hour to get to our motel. It cost about $8 per person to travel this way. We decided to take a shuttle back to the Oakland Airpost. There was a shuttle that advertised $23 for one person and $10 for additional people...so it cost $33 which was worth it.

At Pier 39 the shops were nicer with a great outdoor atmosphere. Loved eating at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.- as in Forest Gump. Great shrimp, fish, chicken fingers, hushpuppies, etc with lots of windows to enjoy the ocean and marina. The gift shop is great, too, if Forest Gump is one of your favorite movies like mine. My husband and I went for our anniversary and it was perfect. The Golden Gate Bridge is unbelievable! It just makes you happy inside seeing it. We walked across and back which was so nice to enjoy each other's company without toddlers wrapped around our legs. With this hotel we received a free 1 hour tour/cruise around Alcatraz and down to the Golden Gate Bridge. You also get 2 free transportation passes each day of your stay that we used for the trolley systems. Their travel system is called the MUNI and includes the trolleys or the city buses. The drivers are a great help for any questions you have. We used the trolley and buses for the Golden Gate Bridge. WE Loved the Trolleys! You can just ride with no particular destination in mind to get a feel for the city. Also great for going to the section of the city for the major shopping area (I can't remember what it's called but the area feels like New York City- very busy, hustle and bustle.) And remember the MUNI passes were free! We rented a car to go to Napa Valley to see the vineyards and Muir Woods to see the giant redwood trees. This was a nice little morning hike that my husband really enjoyed. Whatever the weather says for your trip to San Fran, take a heavy jacket/ coat.
