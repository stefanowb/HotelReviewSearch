After reading some of the reviews I was a bit wary so it therefore came as a pleasant surprise to find our party welcomed by the manager personally and we were given the key to a great room on the 3d floor. Comfy beds, T.V., ample wardrobe and drawer space. Goodsized bathroom with bath and shower over the bath. Roasting hot water and lovely white thick towels. The towels were changed every day whether they were all used or not. The bathroom looked spanking new! The towel heater in the bathroom was turned off as seemingly it gets too hot to touch so we just left the bedroom door open and it heated the bathroom. The hall and stairways were always warm and cosy. In fact some people were complaining of the heat but that particular week the weather had turned unseasonally good! One complaint was no lift. There was a lot of elderly folk on our trip who found the stairs hard going. We had been told the lift was out of order before booking so we had the choice of booking or not but it didn't seem to me that it was getting any attention, and it was not codoned off! The food was fair and always warm. Could have done with a better choice of veg. We had 2 veg every night but one of them was always carrots! Rost potatoes every night too. Although nice could have been a boiled potatoe an odd night. The staff were always attentive and Scott, the manager always eager to please. All in all a pleasant stay.", "title": "March Break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jintykay", "date": "April 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 127868862}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Went for a family meal, soup barely warm, fish terrible only good thing to say about the meal was they managed to get the dessert cold ,it was icecream.
