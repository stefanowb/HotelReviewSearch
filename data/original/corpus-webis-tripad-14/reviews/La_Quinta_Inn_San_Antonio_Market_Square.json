I cannot stress how much I loved this hotel and loved San Antonio. This hotel is very easy to find from the freeway. The lobby was large and very inviting. My rate was very low because I booked early. Check-in was very easy and all staff during my stay were more than friendly, helpful, and accommodating. My room was large and clean, smelled fresh, and felt new. The windows opened to let in lots of light and fresh air. I had a great view of Market Square. The location can't be beat--you're steps away from Market Square, a top tourist destination. I walked across the street and shopped in all the fabulous little shops, and had a fabulous dinner at the famed Mi Tierra Restaurant. The pool area was large and very clean if you wanted to spend time at the pool. Breakfast had tons of choices and lots of places to sit and enjoy your food. I walked several times down to the Alamo, Tower of the Americas, Riverwalk, and all the tourist fun (about 20 minute walk at a brisk pace). The Riverwalk is one of the coolest things I've ever seen!!!!! Or, if you don't want to walk there's tons of easy public transportation including the buses and streetcars that run every 5-10 minutes and will take you everywhere. The purple line goes right by the hotel and the red line runs behind Market Square. I didn't have to touch my car in 4 days which is ideal for me--I walked or took the public transportation everywhere. The only downsides I saw were no public business center/Internet station which I enjoy because I don't bring a laptop. Also, the hotel was a bit noisy at times because of the kids, the trains, the birds flying around, and the commotion over at Market Square. But if noise is an issue for you, just ask for a room facing the back and close your windows. None of this bothered me in the least and I will definitely return to this La Quinta when I go back to San Antonio!!

On the positive site, La Quinta has done a nice job painting the outside of an older La Quinta hotel in the Market Square area of San Antonio. The motel is only a few minutes walk from the Riverwalk and Alamo. The front office staff were pleasant during check in. The inside of the room had been rennovated as well but was clean but on the tiny side. The front desk was also very kind to let us check in at noon. The negatives however outway the positives. First, be advised that this hotel has outside corridors. At night folks gather outside of the room in the parking lot to talk. Despite calls to the front desk this occurred to the early hours of the morning. Perhaps the arrival of Hurricane Ike was creating too many problems for the front office. Several vendors from the local area continually drop things through the doorways at nite which is kind of irritating because you cant tell what someone is doing outside of your room.

The sheets had a nice feel to them and were clean. It was quiet all evening and we never heard any noise except when the city animal control was trying to get rid of the birds roosting in the trees across the street. Seems the city sets off fireworks.....we at first thought it was a drive-by shooting. Needless to say, we were relieved to find out that the loud booms were only fireworks. The bathroom was larger than we expected. The tub, toilet and sink were in good shape and working condition. We had plenty of towels. A plus for the room (that was unexpected) was the lighted vanity area outside of the bathroom that allowed one to take care of hair and makeup while someone else was in the bathroom. Adequate desk area too. Cable TV was good and a lovely addition to the room was a recliner.....wonderful to be able to put your feet up and relax. The La Quinta Market Square location is directly across the street from Mi Tierra restaurant which is open 24/7 and convenient for a late night snack. My only complaint is that when we checked in at 6:30 p.m. we requested and paid for a roll away bed to be delivered to the room. We left to visit with family and upon arrival back at the La Quinta at 11:00 p.m. we noticed that there was NO roll away bed. We called the front desk where we were informed that the desk clerk was the only one on duty and could not deliver the roll away to the room. We were in town for a funeral and therefore wanted a good place to stay for a reasonable price. We were overall rather happy with our stay. We have stayed at the Adam's Mark, now the Crowne Plaza, and it was VERY nice......of course it came with a hefty price.

The Riverwalk and Alamo are a short Trolley ride away or a $5 cab ride. There are birds everywhere, 75% of the hotel parking spaces are fine, just avoid the trees. The Mexican restaurant across the street (Mi Tierra) was excellent. IMHO, The Riverwalk was great, with an overproponderance of restaurants (how many times can you eat in one night?) and not enough casual drinking spots. Durty Nelly's soon became our favorite place.
