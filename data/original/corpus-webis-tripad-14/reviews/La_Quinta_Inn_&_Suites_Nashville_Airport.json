The LaQuinta was an EXCELLENT value for the $$ (AAA rates) the rooms were clean, beds were comfy, and the area is SAFE!! Plenty of places to eat nearby, Waffle House across the street, KMart across the street, 2 mins to airport, and easy on/off to xway to get to Downtown / Vanderbuilt area - just a 10 min car ride away. I didn't get a chance to use the outdoor pool, but it looked fine and would have swam if time allowed.

It's actually a La Quinta Inn & Suites, which means it's a little bit nicer than the plain old La Quinta Inn--fluffier towels, pillow-top mattresses, massagin shower heads, and the staff a little bit more professional. It also means it costs $89/night for a room with two double beds intead of $79, but it's TOTALLY worth it. I unfortunately didn't find a hotel guide in my room, and they didn't have an extra one for me, so that was disappointing. I also found the wireless network to be painfully slow. And I really wanted to work out, but I couldn't get into the fitness center. I asked the front desk if it was closed for the night, and she said yes, it closed at 10pm. I must have looked really disappointed, because when I got back to my room, my husband said she called and said she'd let me in anyway. That was awesome! This is not the first time a La Quinta employee has gone out of their way to help me, so this just reinforced my commitment to staying at a La Quinta whenever possible. Like most La Quintas, this one has waffles in the morning, but I noticed this one and the one from Texarkana, TX don't have butter, just this foul-tasting margarine.

The one I ended up at on I think it was Donlee (??) Pike, is as close to a Dump as one can get . it is primarily frequented by Truck drivers from CSX. As a business woman constantly being surrounded by these Hulking, Loud, overtired drivers isn't my cup of tea. The hotel itself is OLD. and in need of some repair. The toilet didn't flush (reported but not repaired before departure) and beds need replacing. I went down for the \"complimentary breakfast\" at 7:30 a.m. There were no Muffins, no Bagles, and only Cherrios left (as far as cereal goes) so if you wanted anything but plain white toast and coffee, you'd better be up and downstairs by 6 a.m. And again, in the company of a room full of truck drivers.
