The hood is fine and you have plenty of choices of food and drinks with in walking steps away. There was no street noise at all but I did face the harbor not the street.

Our delight quickly evaporated when both Friday and Saturday nights we were kept awake by the yelling, swearing and fighting that carried out outside the building. Tis carried on until 5:30am in the morning both nights. Not a great sight when we went for a walk Sunday morning and there was a body lying right by the front door that we had to walk around.....

We had a two bedroom suite with complete kitchen that was simply incredible.
