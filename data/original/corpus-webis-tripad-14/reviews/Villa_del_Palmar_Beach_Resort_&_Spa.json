I won\u2019t go into great details about my stay but I will hit on the key points. Check in was easy. We arrived at 4:00pm and were told our room wasn\u2019t ready. They had us sit in the lobby and wait for about 30 minutes. Just as others said, they tired to sell us a timeshare, since I look younger for my age I just told them I wasn\u2019t 28 years old and not married and never heard from them again.

They told us our room would not be ready for at least an hour - give me a break. Then they put us in the older section by the quiet pool - this is actually Villa del Mar - but they don't tell you that. The rooms are not updated at all in this section. We said no to visiting FLAMINGO'S. They were relentless. The phone rang every single day asking us to go so we could get our VIP card. No matter what, they kept calling. The food and drinks were a joke. How could you screw up a cheeseburger!! Tried several different drinks - all watered down -- way, way down. (To the point of almost being tasteless.) I'm sorry to be such a Debbie Downer, but as Palace Resort Premier Members I never realized how spoiled I was. Palace Resorts are gorgeous, modern and surpass this place in every way. PV is a slum.

The only problem when you try to use it at the market you have to charge it to your room. WE like to pay as we go and this charging to the room I do not like.

We are timeshare owners in Cabo San Lucas and traded for this property only because we like PV better than Cabos. We are on a \"trial ownership\" for 2 years to see how we like belonging to the Villa Group. It seemed logical to us, that if one sold someone a temporary Gold ownership, that one would do whatever it takes, within reason, to impress that party in hopes that they contract for a permanent ownership when the temporary was expired. Well, our reasoning was way off. We arrived in the late afternoon only to discover that a studio (not an upgrade to a 1 bedroom) was indeed held for us, but it was on the 1st floor in front of the pool. Well, if you read the previous reviews, you have heard how noisy the pool area is. This really burned us because we booked our room 7 months prior. We inquired as to where we could be moved to (offering to pay for an upgrade)and the options only got worse (main building facing the street)and that they had no open 1 bedrooms. We asked to speak to the manager and she offered us a 1 bedroom (that magically appeared) and had the bellman take us to room 409 and 410. Huh? (We are married) These rooms are at the older Villa Del Mar. The catch was that it was two seperate rooms, one being a bedroom with a bath and the other a kitchen/livingroom/bath that were connected by a terrace. So, we had to go outside each time we wanted something from the other room. This was a little strange and got on our nerves after a week, but it was nice to have the 2 full baths and the very large LR. Needless to say, we did not go to the \"meeting\" (sales pitch) that they insisted we needed to attend. They are hardcore sales people to the point of rudeness and they start the second you get there. You cannot even go to your room before they insist on setting up an appt with you to see the new Flamingos. This is not smart when you are dealing with people who are tired with jet lag and only want a drink and a lounge chair! Everyone in the lobby is trying to sell you a timeshare at the Flamingos.
