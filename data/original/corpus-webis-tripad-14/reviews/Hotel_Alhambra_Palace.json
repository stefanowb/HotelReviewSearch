It's an easy and interesting walk into town (Plaza Nueva) along the walls of the Alhambra and a convenient bus ride back up. This was my second stay and really nothing has changed in the five years since my first. The room this time was a little smaller but adequate. The bathroom was not arranged very well and also small. The service is a little snooty. The sandwiches in the bar were expensive and made us laugh when they were sadly presented on the plates with no garnish, no presentation - not even cut. The breakfast is wonderful and the hotel is spotless.

It got worse later in the evening - perhaps supplying the HVAC system or something.
