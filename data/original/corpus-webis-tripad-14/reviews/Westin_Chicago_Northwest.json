The construction started at between 6-7:00 a.m. each day and lasted all day with pounding, sawing, etc. going constantly.

Check out time is 12:00, so this did not make me happy at all. Upon checking with the front desk I was told they couldn't do anything about it, couldn't move us to another room, and would not credit our bill, even though we would basically have to get up and shower & check out early. That's fine for business, but not what I wanted to do on my vacation. The best they could do was give us free breakfast in the morning, which was nice, but not adequate compensation in my opinion for the noise and inconvenience for 6 nights.", "user": "Riversider Raymond", "date": "March 27, 2006", "id": 4737750}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Love the bartenders", "text": "On one hand it is good they are remodeling the hotel. The rooms I've seen needed it badly. There was grout falling off the tub, the carpet was stained, the decor very dated, and the mattresses and bedding were horrible.

Upon calling the desk, I was told, unapologetically, that they were overbooked by 11 rooms (my problem?). Bedding is of the old \"bedspread\" variety, not the up-to-date duvet style. The carpet in my room had what appeared to be bleach spots all over it - very unappealing. The atrium design may look impressive, but when there's a boisterous group at the bar until 1:00am (as there was while I was there), the noise reverberates throughout, making it difficult to fall asleep. Bring earplugs. The immediate area is primarily office buildings. No services or restaurants within walking distance. Short drive to many restaurants, though. The gym in the building charges $8 to work out, and it closes far too early (9:00pm). The hotel does not have its own exercise room.
