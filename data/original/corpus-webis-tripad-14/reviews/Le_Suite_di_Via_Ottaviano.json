It was the perfect place for my family of four adults. We needed a comfortable and clean place to sleep and shower. We were on a budget and this was affordable and included great service along with a fantastic view. We all had nice hot showers. We stayed in a \"family\" room with a large double bed and bunk beds. My 30 year old son found the top bunk very comfortable. (I wanted a close family vacation and I got it)! No, you will not find a pool, gym, huge rooms, or a dining room - you will find a great location with comfortable beds and an owner who will go out of his way to help you. The breakfast in the morning was more than enough to get us started. Email the owner for precise directions so that you can give them to your taxi driver - this helped us tremendously - this was our first trip to Italy and we made one HUGE mistake - we overpacked! It was a major problem pulling (dragging) our luggage from Rome to Venice to Empoli and then back home!

Minutes to buses that take you straight across the Tiber to the heart of ancient Rome, and minutes to the Metro that goes about anywhere a tourist would want.

The reviews were accurate. Room was clean, as was the bathroom. Some rooms have bathtubs, and others have showers. We got a room with a shower, but it was not facing the street, so it was very quiet. The location to the Vatican is perfect (a 10 minute easy walk). It is a 4 minute walk to the Metro (subway), which takes you wherever you want to go in Rome (will get you to all the tourist sites). They bring you a Continental Breakfast in your room (you tell them the time), and all the beverages, etc. in the refrigerator were less expensive than you could find in the street). This is a small thing, but it is nice when a hotel does not rip you off for the mini bar. Upon your arrival you are greeted at the door of the Hotel (4th floor of a commercial/residential building (don't worry it has an elevator). I should also note that it was very easy to get to the Hotel via the Metro from the Rome Termini Train Station (Romes main train station). If you have alot of luggage, you will be better off taking a taxi (we did not have alot of luggage). In summary, if you are looking for a clean, secure location to stay (not to hang out at, but to get a good nights sleep and \"get out to the sites everyday.\" This is a good choice. If you are looking for a place to hangout, there is no lobby, breakfast room, or any other place to stay except in your room, so this would not be the place for you. Also, you cannot dial out for local calls on the phones in the rooms, so you will need to use their phone in their little office near the entrance. Simply ask them, and they will let you use it.

It was classed as a B&B when I booked, but in reality it's rather like a small boutique hotel.

It will take you about 20/30 minutes to walk to the centre of Rome, and I'd recommend doing it - you see so much more of the city this way. The room was spotlessly clean on our arrival, and it was kept that way every day too. The bed was fantastically comfortable. The whole suite and the bathroom exuded a plush, luxurious feel. We had breakfast (included in the price) either in the little bar down on the street, opposite the suite, or in the room, if arranged the evening before with the suite's owner. The owner (Angelo) was very helpful, although communication wasn't the easiest as we couldn't speak Italian, and the owner's English was a tad rusty. When we arrived Angelo gave us a map of Rome, and pointed out all the bus/trams routes for us to take to see the main visitor sites and recommended a few places to eat. On the last day of our visit, Angelo also arranged a taxi back to the airport for 40 Euros, he gave us a choice of paying him or the taxi driver so chose to pay Angelo. The next day a taxi was waiting for us without having the hassle of haggling a price with the taxi driver.
