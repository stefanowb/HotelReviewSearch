Ample parking, superb guiness, lovely period rooms with four poster beds in several. Hotel has just been taken over recently but have kept the same brilliant staff. Could do with getting a handyman in to check lots of little fix it jobs around like: squeaky doors, wonky wall pictures, lose shower handles but all of these things are minor and can be sorted quickly no problem. What you get here, is home from home comfort, with big squashy leather chairs in the reading room, shiny oak polished floors and immaculately cleaned and ironed white Irish linen table cloths. My only recommendation is that they update their written hotel guest information to include other local restaurants and cafe's, local exercise facilities for example at Clonmel Swimming Pool and fun places locally to take children like the wonderful river side play park on the road out to Waterford / the new ish bowling alley on the outskirts of town/the local cinema etc.", "title": "Now our second home !", "user": "BaaCheshireUK", "date": "April 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 60313035}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at Raheen House for Valentines Night, it was wonderful, lovely food, great staff, nice foue poster bed???", "title": "wonderful, Romantic", "user": "SUZZZZZZ10", "date": "February 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 56185041}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I also stayed here for a wedding I attended last year.
