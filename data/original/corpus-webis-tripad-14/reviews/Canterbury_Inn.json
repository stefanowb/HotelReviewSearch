Nothing about the room says luxury.

The comforter on the bed is standard-issue two-star-hotel. The towels are sandpaper, there is no bedskirt, and the toilet seat didn't stay up unless I held it. There are thin walls, so thin that I heard two couples \"making noise\" simultaneously, in what I assume were two separate rooms.

A week after our stay, when we were home halfway across the country, we get a bill for $166+ and a claim that there was a cigarette burn in a window screen. I immediately called and spoke to the clerk to dispute that fact, only to be told that they had pictures of the hole and of a cigarette butt in the trashcan. Those pictures could be years old for all we know, or the housekeeping staff could have smoked in the room, or it could all be a scam. But considering we did not take pictures of every inch of the room before we left, we cannot dispute their claim and will probably be out the $166, but we can make sure that anyone else who stays at this hotel makes sure to have the maid or clerk check their room before check-out and have documentation showing that you didn't smoke in the room.
