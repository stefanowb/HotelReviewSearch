The proprietors had suggested a good taxi company and booked it for us in advance, which was most helpful. We were allocated Room 5, which was beautifully appointed and absolutely spotless. My only negative would be if you were staying for a few nights you might find it a little cramped as the en-suite had been built into the room. Double room (unfortunately a small double which we're not used to) and the pillows were a little hard, but otherwise a most comfortable stay. Extras were provided that you don't even always get at a good hotel, eg. bottles of mineral water, good tea/coffee making facilities with biscuits and cottonwool, etc, provided in the bathroom. Excellent breakfast - fruit juice, cereals, yoghurts, cheeses, and the cooked breakfast was lovely.
