The hotel is very new and modern. The rooms are clean and spacious enough for two (though i was only one person in it). The location is great just a block away from the Wangfujing shopping street. It's not far from the Forbidden City but, since distances are so large in Beijing, it makes sense to take cabs anyway (and they're cheap).", "title": "Great choice in great area of Beijing", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "NYC304", "date": "September 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8696044, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Service and location"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007", "text": "What really sets this hotel apart from other 4 star properties is the service - which was at a 5 star or above level.

Had dinner and breakfast in the room and all was very fresh and good. The staff was very helpful. Got lots of good info from Jeff Zhang who works at the concierge desk. The tours are pricey. You can find your own a lot cheaper. Set up a tour to go to the great wall at Mutianyu and had the driver all day. The charge was $800RNB. We probably would have negotiated that but we were flying in from Datong that day and our plane was delayed so the driver waited for us several different times at airport as no one really knew what time our plane was arriving. Our driver, Yong, was there waiting when we arrived as our flight was 3 hours late with cold drinks in hand ready to take us. Yong spoke english but was hard to understand sometimes. We got to Mutianyu around 2 which was perfect as it wasnt crowded at all. A cable car takes you up to the top and you can walk down or have a choice to take the cable car or toboggle down to the bottom. Of course, I took the toboggle. So much fun. Next morning went to see the Summer Palace and Forbidden City. If you are pressed for time I would recommend the Summer Palace over the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City is just a bunch of buildings and museum stuff. Best to go across the street on the back side of Forbidden city. Looks to have more interesting stuff..If you want to do local shopping. Go to Hutong where the locals go and live. Wangfujing Street is overpriced. TIPS: Best to take your hotel info written in chinese so that the taxi knows exactly where to go. When arriving at airport use the Taxi Station where all drivers are legal. The taxi station is right outside the airport and clearly marked. Almost got hustled by a women stating she was the controller and could get us a taxi. Some guy pops up out of nowhere and starts to direct us elsewhere. Probably would have paid triple if I had gone with that person. Chinese people can spot tourist easily and try to hustle them. If you ignore them and dont pay attention they will leave you alone.
