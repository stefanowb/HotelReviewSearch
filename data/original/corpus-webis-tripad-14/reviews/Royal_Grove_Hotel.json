The hotel and it's rooms are exactly what they look like on the website - very simple and a bit dated. If you are aware of this going in, you won't have any surprises. The location is amazing, though, and we hardly spent any time in the room. You can walk to the beach, shopping and restaurants. Spend a few extra bucks and get a room with AC - it helps drown out the outside noises. Buy some groceries and take advantage of the in-room fridge to help cut food costs. My only complaint is the doors in the room have large air vents, so you hear everything from the hallways and sometimes from other rooms.

What can I say-Monday night they had live music down by the pool with guests setting in-2 hula dancers, it was better than going to a luau -they really make you feel like Ohana. They people that work there are friendly and very helpful.You are close to the bus,stores for snacks,and best of all about 2 blocks from the Duke statue..The price is very good so if your going there make sure you stay here,you won't be disappointed!
