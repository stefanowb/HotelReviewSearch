After corresponding with all 3 decided on Tiffany Hotel and i am so pleased we did. What a fabulous comfortable well situated hotel that offers really everything you could want. We first off we're offered a good deal and breakfast included. I think because we only confirmed a day before we were due and for a weekend n holiday time when many people desert the city. We parked our car right outside ( and this hotel was very easy to find). They helped unload us ( few bags coming from NZ for 5 months European travel) and were just so helpful and informative with what to do, where to eat and what was on that weekend. They also parked our car in a secure parking area. Yes a bit expensive but thats Switzerland. We had a fabulous room in the new section - room 510. We had everything including great nepresso machine that makes coffee or you can use for tea, air con, wifi, cable TV and the area was so quiet. The breakfast was just amazing. Beautiful fresh food hot and cold. One of the best we have had in the last 3 months. really you won't do better than this hotel. I sited the old section and it looked great to with balcony and view", "user": "Jenny V", "date": "August 16, 2012", "id": 137365962}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice hotel and good location", "text": "The four star hotel was located in a nice area very near good transportation. The staff was extremely helpful even attempting to change our airline reservations when we discovered that our last day we were spending in Geneva was a national holiday and the attractions we wished to see would be closed.We decided to spend our last day in France and they made wonderful suggestions as to where we should go(Annecy).We were told that our room was an upgrade because we were celebrating our anniversary.Although the room was adequate it was the smallest one we had during our two week trip across Switzerland.My other negative comment is about the price of a full breakfast which was not included in the room rate. It was 29 cf which did not include omlettes to be made fresh or even fried eggs made to order which were an additional 8cf. Fresh squeezed juice was also an additional 8cf.Continental breakfast of juice,one cup of coffee, and one croissant or sliced bread was 9cf.", "user": "Stanley K", "date": "August 6, 2012", "id": 136368500}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "However,because it was our anniversary, they sent to our room a beautiful selection of delicious fresh fruit.", "title": "An expensive stay but worth it.", "user": "808john", "date": "August 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136273182}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Cosy hotel, a bit mazy", "text": "This hotel was worth the cost . It was well positioned for getting about Geneva. The hotel was friendly and informative on our arrival. Our room was what we had asked for ; no smoking, front facing, no pets. Eating out in Geneva is very expensive and after walking round Geneva, we realised what good value and quality the restaurant was. Expect to pay nearly double what you would in UK for a decent meal with a bottle of wine. Make sure that you use the city card , given to you at the hotel, for buses, trams and yellow boats, as you pay for it in your city tax, at 8 CHF a day.

We enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel is very well situated, a short walk to the old town and nearby the theater hall the concert hall and the conservatory of Geneva. Very different neighborhood from the one where many of Geneva hotels are situated (train station). The hotel is very nice. Rooms, lobby, library, breakfast room, fitness room are all designed in a very good taste. Rooms are bit on the small size. We did have a problem with the air conditioning in the room. It was one of those hot days in Geneva and I was bit concern, remembering reading one of the past review in this matter in Tripadvisor but our experience was very different. Matter was taken very seriously. Problem was solved within very reasonable time and from that moment the air conditioning in the room was one of the best I've experienced in European hotels.
