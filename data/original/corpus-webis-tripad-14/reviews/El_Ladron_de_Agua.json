The hotel was a beautiful blend of original architecture and modern amenities. I stayed in Melissandra room which did not have a view and was noisy but clean and comfortable with a wonderful steamy hot shower and lovely touches like dried flowers in a vase on the writing table. Breakfast was 9 euro and started at 8 am. I arrived on Sunday night and advised the staff that I was expected to be at my language school at 8 am for an orientation the following day. The lady said that breakfast would be ready for me by 7/7:30 am no problem, but when I arrived the next morning nothing had been set up. The gentleman at the front desk took out some pre-sliced fruit from the refrigerator and served me a cup of tea. I sat in the bar area and ate a few bites of the fruit before heading out for the day, still hungry. The full breakfast was much more substantial and quite nice. I was curious to see if they would charge me for the first day's breakfast in the end. Sure enough they did. I was not prepared to argue over 9 euro so I did not raise the issue but it is worth warning other people about. I did not find the staff to be particular friendly, rather frosty in fact. I asked if they could assist in booking an afternoon guided walk in the surrounding Sierra Nevada mountains and it appeared as though no one ever asked that question before. I ended up getting useful information from a British classmate who runs a hotel outside of town and had a fabulous hike one afternoon starting from a village called Monachill.

It has amazing touches like a bubbling water feature in the middle of an open courtyard- very restful -which is ringed by balconies with rooms- and big colourful wrap around artwork in the foyer. The dark woodwork, the artwork, the furniiture and bathrooms of the rooms are beautiful - a mix of very contemporary and historical detail. We stayed in a special double, which was great - our room was a bit dark but it was quiet. Some rooms face the front which would probably be brighter but potentially noisier. If you are a couple- I would suggest asking for twin beds as the double beds in Spain tend to be small. There is a room off the courtyard which feels like you are in someone's living room with free internet access and a bookcase. Art is on the walls throughout the hotel - giving it a gallery feeling. The breakfast is in a cellar of sorts- and was very good (not cheap though). The location is directly below the hill where the Alhambra sits- and is right in the Albayzin area. The only problem is if you are arriving by car- it's impossible! I would reccommend leaving your car at a garage outside the old quarter and getting to the hotel by taxi. The staff were very helpful, courteous and spoke good English. All in all a very memorable stay.
