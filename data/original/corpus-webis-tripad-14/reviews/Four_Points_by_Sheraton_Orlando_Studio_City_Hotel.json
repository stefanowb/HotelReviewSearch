We stayed on the 16th floor overlooking island of adventure, indoor sky diving and wet n wild it was definitively nice, the only problem was that unfortunately, that was not enough for me to overlook how dirty the sheets in one of the beds were and how many small hairs I found in the bathroom tub before we even unloaded. Luckily, there were two beds and the one we slept on seem fine. B/c The ice machine on the 18th floor doesnt work , we ended up going to the 15th floor and we noticed they were remodeling those units.

Universal studios and Islands of adventure is a nice 20 min stroll away. Walgreens, I-Hop, Dennys, and 7-11 all within the vicinity. Lynx and I-ride stop outside the hotel. We found the Lynx was quicker then the I-ride, and was less crowded. The lifts were out of service on one occasion, but this was due to an emergency, and staff apologised for the inconvenience. As we were only on the 4th floor, taking the stairs was no bother. The lady on the Universal studios desk in reception booked an airboat ride at our request, which was very kind and helpful.

Only complaint was that the housekeepers when going in and out of rooms cleaning one day were slamming the doors. I think this happened atleast 5-8 times. It was crazy. But other than that it was very nice! We were on the 20th Floor. The views were pretty good too. Oh yes, the channel changing for the TV was extremely SLOW.
