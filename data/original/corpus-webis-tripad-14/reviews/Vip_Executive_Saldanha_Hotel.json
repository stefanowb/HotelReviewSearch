We've greatly appreciated this hotel since it is conveniently located 5 minutes walking distance from a subway station and main bus routes that get you downtown and since it is located in a quiet environment with plenty of restaurants nearby. The room was clean, comfortable and a very good value given the price and location. Now, 2 negative remarks about this hotel: 1) The staff is not very friendly, will remain distant and unattentive but we believe this is a minor inconvenience and 2) the breakfast, at an additional cost of 4 Euros per person, is minimal and not worth the price (solution to this problem: on a nearby street, 3 minutes walk from this hotel, there's an Ibis Hotel which charges 5 Euros per person and which has a superb buffet breakfast). All this to say, we would go back to this hotel without a doubt.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 4, 2004", "id": 1537770}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Estremadura", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Lisbon"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 27, "very good": 65, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 37}, "aka": "Vip Hotel Lisbon", "slim_ranking": 0.481818181818, "description": "The Saldanha VIP Executive Hotel with 54 rooms, has suffered more than a renovation, the hotel was completely rebuilt, and has now opened has a brand new 4 star Hotel.
