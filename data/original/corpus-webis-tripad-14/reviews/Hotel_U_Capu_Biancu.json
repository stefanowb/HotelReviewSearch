The negative reviews of this hotel neglect to mention some very important points. The view from the hotel is absolutely breathtaking, the food is superb , the staff are friendly and courteous and the private beach is great . Also, our room was beautifully decorated . The road to the hotel can be a bit daunting, but most of the roads in corsica are like this, as the island seems unspoilt by tourism (and I hope will stay that way).

Yes, I agree with these people from Great Britain. It is a shame to have given 4 stars to such a place. We arrived there late in the afternoon with the intention of staying a few days and left before dinner time. Peeling paint on the doors, distastefull decoration, awful smells, small rooms, the place was so unattractive. The \"road\" to arrive there is a challenging trail for four wheel drive vehicules, and to make a long story short, there is absolutely nothing positive to say about this hotel.", "title": "Hotel Capu Biancu : Awful, don't go there", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "vajrasattva", "date": "June 15, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3558267}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Don't go there", "text": "When we first found the website for this 4 star hotel near Bonifacio in Southern Corsica we thought it would be the perfect place to stay for a few days.

In fact the last 5km is all unmade or partially made roads and it takes approx 20mins to traverse this section, with the largest pot-holes we have ever seen.

I have to say I have been left with the view that Tripadvisor generally exists for people who want a moan. The hotel is superb, the drive down through the maquis( yes, part of the road is unmade but only about 25% of the length) makes a really nice approach to the hotel. On arrival at the reception we were shown around all the facilities with everything explained whilst in the meantime our baggage was taken from our car and put in to our bedroom. The view from our balcony was across the bay and although the room could be classed as small by US standards by european standards it is good. The whole hotel has been designed with the idea of totally relaxing you. The restaurant has both an outdoor and indoor area and you can choose where you would like to eat. We had half board which meant there was a limited choice two starters,two main ( one meat,one fish ) and two desserts. The variety is good though and the quality of food first class. The A la carte menu is expensive as is the food in the beach restaurant but well worth it The swimming pool is a real bonus with lots of imagination gone in to the design, with a good number of sun loungers. The private beach is a little disappointing as Corsica has some great white sandy beaches, unfortunately the hotel beach is a made up of shingle but once in the water it is great for snorkeling with lots of fish swimming around. The hotel offers a boat service (at a small cost) to take you inaccessible beaches. There ia a great white sandy beach just around the next headland north of the hotel.The hotel staff were excellent, all could speak English, which given my level of French was good, were friendly and attentive. The hotel is expensive but as with most things you get what you pay for and all the guests I spoke to thought the hotel was exceptional so forget the bank balance anf go ahead and spoil yourself.", "title": "A real oasis", "user": "Tyke69", "date": "July 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8130318, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The location and the relaxed atmosphere", "disliked": "\u2014 The shingle beach"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "PS you even get a bath robe", "title": "Beautiful Rustic Retreat", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Arabella35", "date": "August 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5630773, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Well Decorated & Comfortable - Very Rustic!", "disliked": "\u2014 The price!"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Booking problems", "text": "Having read the few mixed reviews on this hotel I was actually dreading turning up for our week's stay at the beginning of August and was beginning to wonder whether the fabulous website was a case of artisitic license - this is not the case - it's a really lovely hotel.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 18, 2006", "id": 4986290}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "We were prepared for the dirt-track road (11 mins in a small hire car, not the 20 mins previously recorded) and the reports are correct, it's very pot-holey, but I also agree that this is part of the charm of the place.

Our check-in was efficient and friendly - most of the staff speak excellent English although we did try to speak in French as much as possible - and after a welcome cocktail in the bar, we were taken to our room.
