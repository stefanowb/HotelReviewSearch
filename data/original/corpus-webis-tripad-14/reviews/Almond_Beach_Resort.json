Having never visited Belize before, we were unsure what to expect. The entire experience was a positive one (other than missing a day due to a flight delay in Dallas.) The staff is so friendly and the accomodations were even better than they appeared on the website. The ocean there is the beautiful Caribbean blue that you hope for and the water temperature was 81 degrees - usually still in the morning and the wind picks up in the afternoons. We had a huge flat screen t.v. in our room which was handy for DVD movies after dark and the housekeeping services made daily visits with loads of clean towels and fresh flowers. The meals were wonderful and the fresh, locally grown o.j. in the mornings along with the individually cooked omlettes are highly recommended. We took two of the excursions offered - snorkeling the Barrier Reef and Zip Lining/Cave Tubing -- both of which were well organized and really fun for the four of us, two adults and our daughters ages 14 and 12.
