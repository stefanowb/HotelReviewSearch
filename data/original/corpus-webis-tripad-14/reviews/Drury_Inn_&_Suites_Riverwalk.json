I like to get a good deal and stay somewhere nice, but I don't like paying alot. The prices of the hotels on the Riverwalk are very high. This was the best hotel for the money that I could find after hours of shopping. My husband and I were very happy with my choice. They have a great breakfast, happy hour with 3 free drinks each night and soda and popcorn each afternoon included in your rate. They also have a pool and hottub for relaxing.
