We have previously had bad experiences of hotels in Paris, so we were at first unsure of this 3 star hotel. The main advantage for us was that it was near to where we get off the bus for Ryan Air flights. We read reviews that is was small and that we should book a 'deluxe' room - but we were not disappointed in the 'standard' room that we got. It was immaculately clean, nicely decorated and was big enough for the 2 of us. The room faced onto a quiet residential street at the back of the hotel so the room was very quiet. Service was not brilliant, but reception staff were helpful and their english was very good. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as we thought it was expensive, but there is a small supermarket across the road where you can buy pastries and juice and that did us. The hotel is really handy for the metro so everywhere in Paris is do-able from this location. I would definately recommend this hotel, although it was a really reasonable price, it certainly felt like a more expensive, very well run hotel. Great Value for money for the centre of Paris!", "title": "Parisian Gem!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "andare", "date": "April 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7286331, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and Value for Money", "disliked": "\u2014 Breakfast was expensive!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We had booked another hotel but due to renovation the hotel arranged for us to be transferred to the Best Western hotel. After our initial shock because we had no idea anout the tranfer we were so impressed. The hotel was spotless clean, modern but not in a trendy way furniture, excellent rooms for paris standards since I have stayed in another 4 hotels there during previous stays. The bathrooms and the main room were excellent. Location was also very convenient since the metro was so close.
