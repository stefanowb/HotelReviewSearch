We used the Alilaguna Orange Route from the airport, which you get to on foot within 5 minutes. From the Rialto Bridge it is another few minutes\u2019 walk which is very straight forward and after the one little bridge you cross there are signs for Ca' Amadi on the walls. We arrived at 12.40 and while we were expected to be asked to leave our bags and come back later our room was ready and after some paperwork we were shown to our beautiful junior suite. It looks just like the pictures. The furniture is well appointed and the bathroom has very nice fittings. It is a very spacious room, which is rare in European cities. As other have pointed out, it is a little loud. We didn't hear much honking, but some private boats ride by with their radios loud. If you are a light sleeper I would a room away from the canal. The air conditioning unit was very good at keeping the room cool, but was a bit loud as well. During the day you will hear the passing Gondoliers pointing out the balcony that is just next the window to the room and explaining how Marco Polo once owned the building. For breakfast they have a good coffee maker, a toaster with fresh bread, yoghurt, a bowl of mixed fruit (not fresh), cereals and pastries. They have a sign which states you can ask a staff member for eggs, but we didn't do this. I would recommend Locanda Ca' Amadi as a great place to stay. We ate at the Osteria Barababao which is right next door and good for days you don't want to have a long walk back after dinner, there is only a small menu, but what we ordered was very good.", "title": "Immaculately presented, historic B&B", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "WillnSarah", "date": "July 2, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 133302407}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is very well located, close to the Rialto bridge.

As independent travelers, who take no tours (but who do a lot of research), this historic hotel was a treasure. The pillows are hard by American tastes, but this is more than made up for by the kind attentiveness of the manager and her family. We booked a room that faced the canal, and when we got there, it was hot and noisy; with no fuss at all, we were shown two other rooms and switched to one that faced the courtyard, which is quiet. When I needed help calling someone I was to meet in Venice, the manager quickly agreed to make the call herself. There is plenty of hot water, the rooms are sparkling clean, breakfast is good, and delicious cookies as well as water are left out at night for guests. In a city of no porters where everyone thinks assisting you with your baggage is equivalent to slavery, this manager found us someone who, for 15 euros (well worth the cost), got us quickly from the VERY EXPENSIVE water taxi--the pilot thought it beneath him to lift our luggage out of the boat--to Ca' Amadi. The hotel is situated in a very quiet courtyard, surrounded by residences; it is less than a 5-minute walk to S. Marco and all the sites. It is also near all the vaporetto stops independent tourists will use. Even if you arrive back at the hotel late, you can find a bar open to buy water, a panini, etc., or get a drink. A flight of steps up to the lobby, a step or two up to the en-suite bath in some rooms. Showers in some rooms, bath tub/shower combination in others. Bidets in bathrooms.

Finding the entrance up the little laneway was a bit daunting to my children but added to the excitement of this little hidden gem. We had the junior suite which overlooked the small canal. We are a family of 5 being three teenage girls and 2 parents. We had plenty of room in this suite. We did not find any excessive noise from the canal at all. The canal seemed to be used mainly by gondolas rather than motor boats and the couple of motorboats we saw moving up our canal were not noisy at all as they had to move very slowly as the canal is narrow. The rooms look exactly as the website depicts and the walls are actually fabric not wallpaper. Breakfast was filling and plenty of it with the attendant constantly watching and refilling supplies as required. The breakfast room has a small balcony off it that overlooks the small canal. The staff are excellent being extremely helpful with any requests we had. Ca'Amadi is close to everything and although Venice is a bit of a rabbit warren with laneways going everywhere, once you get your bearings it is very easy to navigate around. Ca'Amadi has restaurants, shops, take away outlets, a department store, gelato bars surrounding it. Very convenient position, yet quietly tucked away.
