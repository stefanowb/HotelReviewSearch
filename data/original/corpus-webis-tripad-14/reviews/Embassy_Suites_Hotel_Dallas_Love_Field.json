Since our flight departing Miami had us arriving at Dallas Love Field after 10:30 p.m. I called ahead to the hotel and arranged to have food waiting upon our arrival so that our granddaughter would not have to go to bed without dinner. The staff were very accommodating and went out or their way to insure we had a great meal waiting in our rooms for us when we arrived.

We were en route to a wedding in San Antonio but stayed on in Dallas for a concert. I chose Embassy Suites as we like the suites as with young kids it makes it easier to have some space, especially with jet lag. The rooms were as ever comfortable and clean. Our suite looked over Bachmann Trail which is a green park and hiking area which was a lovely plus. As I hate driving in the USA we didnt hire a car so were reliant on cans. The hotel however provided a shuttle, not just to the airport but to a mall about 20 mins away. Both drivers (Richard and Oscar) were lovely and came to collect us on request! Richard also very kindly arranged a cab to take us to a concert and ensured the same driver came and collected us afterwards. This ensured we had a great night with no worroes about getting the 20 miles back to the hotel. As ever the food was good and the evening reception margaritas were so nice I was tempted to ditch the wedding in san Antonio and stay in Dallas!

We stayed here for 3 nights. I'm very picky when it comes to choosing a hotel, and I was not disappointed. It is located in a good area of town, I would feel safe taking a walk around the area of the hotel. We parked in the parking garage under the hotel which I liked, felt my vehicle was very safe. They have a security guard inside the hotel overnight. It was located closer to most things in Dallas than I thought it would be. Only 10 minutes to the Galleria or 10 minutes to downtown Dallas(depending on traffic of coure, we traveled at non peak times), only took about 20 minutes to get to Pete's in Addison. We originally got a room on the 2nd floor and we like to stay on high floors, they were happy to put us on the 6th floor. The rooms are spacious and plenty big enough for the two of us. Something important to every traveler, the rooms were very clean, bathroom was very clean as well as the bedding. I found the top off of a deoderant stick under the bed when leaving the room, but no biggie. Roomservice did a good job and provided turndown service and towels everyday. My two favorite things about this hotel, the breakfast and manager's reception. The breakfast is great, best I have ever had in a hotel. We never really needed to eat lunch because of the big breakfast. Omlelets made to order, eggs, potatoes, hotcakes, sausage, bacon, yum! Plus having the typical cereal, fruit, yougert available. The manager's reception serves free beer, wine, and mixed drinks from 5:30-7:30 every night in the Atrium. Sunday night for some reason it was served in the bar. The selection is a bit limited but you can get most drinks you want, but it's not a free full bar. They mostly serve cheper acohol, but for free I didn't complain. My girlfriend said it was one of the best margritas she every had, and thats her drink of choice, I stuck to Jim Beem and coke. We did drink at the bar one evening, and the bartender was friendly and drink prices were on par with most other places.

Principally, we planed to visit the Arboretum, the Dallas Museum of Art (including Nasher), the World Aquarium, and the Dallas Zoo. I wanted nice amenities, safety, and a central location, all within a reasonable price range. This Embassy Suite fit my needs exceptionally well. When you factored in the fact that you don't have to pay for valet parking (like alot of hotels in downtown Dallas), and you get a quality breakfast (cooked to order, not a cold cereal / danish bar) the quality vs economy was very well balanced. The room was spacious, with two TV's, so my wife could watch the season final of The Bachelor in the sitting room, while my daughter watched Nickelodeon in the bedroom. The mini frig. and microwave were a plus, as was the indoor pool. And while I could actually look out our bedroom window and watch departing jet traffic from Dallas Love Field, I found our room exceptionaly quiet. I found the staff to be engaging, the facilities to be pleasing, and the room accommodating. I have stayed at Hotels in Dallas before, only $30.00 to $40.00 dollars cheaper per night , where you were not certain your car was still going to be there in the morning. When you factor in the cost of a comparable breakfast for two adults and one child at a IHOP, your net gain of staying at a cheap hotel is near zero.
