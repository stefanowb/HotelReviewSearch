{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 264, "name": "Hotel Anastasia", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled solo", "text": "The Anastasia is on a quiet plaza across from the Westin just off Venice's \"high street\". It is an unusually low priced place in the best location, minutes from San Marco and the water bus stop. The room I had was a tad small, so I can't talk about the other accomodations. It was comfortable and modestly and tastefully decorated and wasn't burdened with the Venice-kitsch \"elegance\" so many hotels there go overboard on. It had all the things I needed: elevator, plenty of hot water, aircon, mini bar, and a safe. The room and hotel were neat and clean. Yes, you can hear the gondoliers and tradespeople in the morning --- it's Venice, get over it. You don't hear cars and truck and horns as in any other city. The staff was minimal - just a desk person and a few cleaners. I compliment the desk people on their friendliness and attentiveness. When there was a problem with my reservation, they emailed me immediately, kept it open until I called, and we it immediately over the phone. The breakfast, since so many people seem so unnaturally interested in hotel breakfasts, is just a continental breakfast. I think people should be more concerned with whether the TV remote control is in working order. Mine was worn out - it seems to be the case in many hotels. But that's my only complaint about the Anastasia. A word about Venice: it's smaller than one would think and pretty easy to walk most places. There is virtually no nightlife. Lido has a big, popular beach and it's about 15 minute water bus ride from Venice plus about 10 minutes' walk to the beachside. The water at Lido isn't that clean, however.", "title": "Great choice for location and price", "user": "Massimo1", "date": "June 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 32599943}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "We arrived at 23.00 to find the streets flooded!! After rolling up our jeans we made our way to the hotel, only a few minute walk from St Mark's vaporetta stop. The hotel was well placed and the staff friendly. The room was very clean and the bathroom was well fitted and very clean as well. The room was quite small but perfectly adequate with TV, mini bar and hairdryer. Breakfast was buffet style, simple but well stocked. Information about trips and concerts were readily available. Overall a very pleasant stay for not a lot of money. Thoroughly recommend this hotel.

The hotel is very very centrally located, when every you need to go to toilet, or need to leave you shopping bags, you can directly come to your room and keep on your tour again :)) The hotel personnel can speak English, and they are very helpful. Rooms are not the biggest I have ever seen but are far better than Parisian rooms. Bathroom is all marble, quite new and large. The hotel building is in a small court, even though the are is very central, location is very silent. The breakfast consists of two kind of cheese, honey, marmalade, croissant, bread, cornflakes, tea, coffee, milk and orange juice, which is better than what most of the hotels offer. Mini bar is also okey, they even have mosquito tablettes in the room :) Most of the hotels do not have elevator in Venice (because they are converted from residences / houses of local people), but Hotel Anastasia does. The hotel is suitable for old people, young couples, couples with children and disables visitors. For me, the most important thing was; our room was directly looking to the court infront of the hotel, therefore we had the chance of direct sunlight and view, most of the hotel rooms in Venice are looking to narrow dark streets and some of them even do not have windows so it is better if you include your request in you reservation. Another hint is; ok cannal view is very nice and romantic, but cannals are extremely noisy.", "title": "Exactly the right place to stay", "user": "Gezen_Kedi", "date": "June 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16817694, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 very central but also very quite", "disliked": "\u2014 larger rooms would be better but they are ok"}}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Veneto", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 7, "average": 39, "very good": 127, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 88}, "aka": "Anastasia Hotel Venice", "slim_ranking": 0.322834645669}
