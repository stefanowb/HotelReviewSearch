Ours was new, well-furnished, had good electric hookups (although none in the bathroom) and audio and video jacks for the large, flat-screen TV. The breakfast buffet was great (if it comes with your room) but not worth paying for otherwise. I felt a little put out that I was told the room came with \"bed and breakfast\" but breakfast was a continental buffet. There was plenty to eat, but the \"cooked breakfast\" cost an extra 4 pounds. My only real beef was the wireless. And that's what makes this a 3 instead of a 4. If they didn't offer wireless, it would be fine. But they sell you a ten pound (for 20 hours) wireless pass that sounds great until you find that the only place in the entire hotel that you can get even as much as 18 mbpi is in the front bay window.

The first time I stayed I found the hotel had cancelled my booking and the hotel was full, they weren't interested in finding me a room even though the fault lay with them and not me, that should have been enough to warn me off but I booked once again as the training I attend actually takes place in the hotel so it's easier all round (or so I thought) to stay there. My second attempt was as bad, I had booked a superior Queensgate room which comes with extras such as free wifi, private lounge and access to the gym yet none of this was pointed out to me when I checked in and I had to ask where the gym was, where the lounge was etc. I was in the lounge and needed the wifi password, I asked the barman and he replied that I had to get it from reception, there was no offer to ring and get it from me, oh no, instead I had to pack up all my belongings, laptop, phone, bag etc and trail upstairs to reception to get it. The next day when I arrived at the lounge there was no barman, it's supposed to open at 5, by 5.20 I had enough and trailed upstairs to reception to complain, 5 minutes later a sulky looking barman arrived who proceeded to tell me I shouldn't be in the lounge as I wasn't in a superior room! Every stay since has been pretty much the same, lazy receptionists who are more than prepared to argue the toss with you, even though you are right! My colleagues stayed there recently and even though they had paid for a superior room were shoved in something resembling a broom cupboard and charged for using the gym, even though it was included in the price! My colleague is there now and just text me to say the check in was traumatic, it was the usual story of even though she has booked a superior room the receptionist is saying that she hasn't booked one! Nobody showed her where anything was and the staff were really abrupt and off with her.
