There is also a U bahn station Westentor across from the hotel. The shopping street also begins in front of the hotel. Check-in was friendly and quick. The lobby is huge, it is from a bygone era. The room was huge, large marble bathroom, great water pressure in the shower. There is also a flat screen TV and free Wi Fi, there was also an in room safe. My room had a large desk for working, however no plug for using one's computer. I had to arrange to work on a small night stand next to the bed which did have a wall plug. For such a large room there was only a desk chair, so if two people were sharing, one would have to sit on the bed, or stand. An extra chair of some type would be useful. The bed was probably the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on. It was like sleeping on a piece of plywood. Absolutely no give or take to the mattress. There was also a peculiar smell in the room, and only by opening the window would it dissipate. Breakfast was not included in the rate. It was a pretty good buffet breakfast with a variety of foods. Because of the miserable bed, I will not be able to give this hotel a high rating, after all a good nights sleep on a decent bed is very important.", "title": "Decent Hotel", "user": "yvr1", "date": "December 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 187982765}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Good hotel, but with one drawback, the beds.
