Those reviews that say it's wonderful and those that say it sucks are really both wrong - it's smack in the middle. The room we had was clean, but had little midgey bugs in the sink. View was beautiful though and the bed was soft and clean. Overall the place had a 60's Holiday Inn flavor to it. Pool is small and badly in need of repair. Beach was pretty, but I was a bit apprehensive that the rocks may have been more debris than natural. Desk service was shabby and brusk. Room wasn't ready until the specified 4 PM check-in time. That's understandable, but the front desk never bothered to call us when it was ready as they promised. Restaurants were uneven at best. My turkey club for lunch was made from mystery turkey. My seafood dinner medley over linguini was quite good but my wife's fried shrimp were Swanson's worst! The pool bar seemed to be a hangout for some local workmen cooling down at the end of their day's labors. Not being elitist here, guys, but a shower first woulda been nice! We have to share the bar with you even if it is outside... Being close to the airport can be a convenience or a distraction - you choose.

Also, you only hear the planes taking off for the first few times and then you get used to it. It's not super often anyway. No big deal.
