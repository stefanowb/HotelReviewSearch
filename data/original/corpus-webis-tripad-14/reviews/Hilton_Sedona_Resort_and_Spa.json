Next to the Sedona Golf Resort (walkable distance), my two room suite had a fireplace, refrigerator, wet bar, dual bathroom sinks, small dining area and an ultra-comfortable bed. Although I was offered a red rock view, I chose the golf course view and it was fine, although you can't escape viewing the parking lot. The rooms were very quiet, the decor was tasteful, and the location was great. It is away from the bustle of downtown Sedona which means traffic noise is minimized. It is also close to the Oak Creek Country Club, AND there's a spa. A really nice place.

For this reason alone, I would steer travelers elsewhere...probably to a hotel closer to town. The Hilton is several miles south of Sedona. While that doesn't seem far, it does get old driving back & forth. But if you are interested in playing golf, this is probably a good choice.
