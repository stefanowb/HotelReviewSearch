There was SO much to do - complimentary face painting and temporary tattoos, cookie decorating, Easter egg hunt, egg decorating, arcade games, game room with air hockey and ping pong, moon bounces, mini-golf, beach volleyball. I know I am forgetting stuff as well. There are 4 pools total on the resort - 1 outdoor activity pool with a big slide, 1 outdoor infinity pool, an outdoor kiddie pool and a large indoor pool with an indoor/outdoor hot tub that showed family-friendly movies nightly. Inside pool had a snack bar that served adult drinks as well - excellent mojitos and margaritas. The outdoor pools were heated and we had decent weather so our kids were swimming outdoors in early April in Maryland! They have nighttime s'mores by a big outside fireplace that my kids loved doing. Restaurants are as expected - pricey - but you can cut corners by ordering from their casual bar restaurant called Michener's Library one night for more pub-like food and appetizers and they have the Hyatt kids menu as well. Never got to the spa, but it looked great. The rooms were really nice - clean with comfortable beds, large bathrooms - and get one with a water view, so beautiful to wake up to in the mornings and it's nice to have the balcony as well.

The Regency room is such a nice treat, continental breakfast in the morning, snacks during the day (though the kids were disappointed that there were no cookies our second day), and a great cocktail hour with beer, wine and hor'deurves. I highly recommend the Regency floor, it is well worth the price. All of the staff we encountered were top notch. We made several requests and they were fulfilled promptly. Food was expensive at the resort restaurants, but nothing we didn't expect for this type of resort. Overall, all of us (2 adults and 2 children) has a great stay.
