From the moment we arrived, greeted with a glass of cava at their personal check-in, until we left having been moved to another room so we had somewhere to change and shower before our late flight home, it's been very relaxing and enjoyable. We have nothing but praise for Kim, Debbie, Jessica and Gilda for whom nothing was too much trouble. Also the same could be said for Montoya and the staff at the pool bar and restaurants. It's the personal service and the little extra touches which makes this one of the best hotels we've stayed in. We were on an all inclusive basis. We've eaten in their two wonderful restaurants. We particularly liked Posieden which was quiet and elegant with excellent food and service. Portofino was very good too but more casual. We did eat one evening in the buffet restaurant but didn't enjoy the atmosphere. We are not buffet people! Do have a 'gourmet breakfast' on your terrace one morning. It is fantastic. There is a wonderful Zen Spa where I had an amazing massage and my husband thought the gym facilities there were very good too. We will certainly be returning to this hotel in 2014. Thank you to everyone for a very memorable and relaxing holiday.", "title": "Excellent holiday - we will return", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Speges", "date": "December 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187302275}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled with family", "text": "A very good value for money; a variety of food is greater than in many other 5-star hotels; great care for details (gardening and current refurbishments).", "title": "Excellent Hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "andrzej_s54", "date": "December 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 186424467}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Nice tennis court, with surface suitable for more senior players (not too hard for your legs).", "title": "Another fantastic visit", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "felby", "date": "November 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183675327}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Thank you to the team that is Salome, always there to please, nothing is to much trouble.
