Check-in was easy, and they gave me a room on a high floor with a good view of the airport. Nothing in Newark is really a decent view at all, but this wasnt too bad. The room was standard for a Hilton. Nothing better or worse then most Hilton properties I have stayed at. It was clean, had nice bathoom, comfy bed, and standard amenties. I had plenty of time on my hands so I checked out their pool and fitness area. I never used the pool or hot hub, but they looked above average for a airport hotel. The fitness center I did use, and it's quite small, but no one was in it. All the machines are very new, and room was clean and well stocked. We had a bite to eat a couple of drinks at the lobby bar. Food was just ok in the bar, as they did not have much of a selection. But it's a nice atmosphere --with flat screen TV's and plenty of space for seating.
