Rooms are the smallest in the hotel but have everything you need. Very comfortable bed, plenty of space for 2 people to get around without bumping into each other, nice linen, big soft towels, robes, Molton Brown samples. They also have real coffee and a cafetiere in the room, although milk is UHT, just ask for a jug of fresh to take up with you. Air conditioning is quiet and works well as the room is hot on a hot night. These rooms are totally adequate for a short stay and honestly wouldn't bother spending more on a bigger room. And of course the view is simply to die for especially on a misty morning.", "title": "fabulous", "user": "JMuk", "date": "October 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 118878063}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Room downsides: clutching at straws here but 3 things that drive me crazy in hotel rooms: 1) when I have to \"tidy\" before I can \"use\" - example the towels were all beautifully folded in piles in the shower, looked lovely, but I have to sort them out and put them away before I can shower so ultimately pointless and 2) there is never enough hooks or rails to hang wet towels and 3) bathroom mirrors that are useless for putting on makeup (girls opinion of course).", "title": "80s mod in the Cotswolds", "user": "jack06Maine", "date": "September 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 118716356}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Service was immaculate both in the bar and restaurant in the evening and at breakfast.
