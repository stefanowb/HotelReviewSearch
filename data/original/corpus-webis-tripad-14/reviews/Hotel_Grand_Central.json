Our travel agent informed us that it was in a very good location and US$20 cheaper than Crown Prince Hotel and he would recommend we stay there. Boy were we every wrong for listening to his advice! The lobby was enough to scare us as soon as we entered. It was dark and old and the staff were not helpful at all. The rooms were downright appaling and had a musty smell that wouldn't go away! The beds were crappy, the walls were dirty, the bathroom was gross and moldy, the tv didn't even have its own stand (it was ON the mini bar ref)! The airconditioning was awful and we had to switch rooms twice before ending up in an \"acceptable\" cooler room. After a night in this hotel we were pretty much ready to cry and self-pity was definitely setting in. We later found out that the hotel was quite known for being a brothel! No wonder I was sent away from the \"spa\" place upstairs by the \"mama-san\" (pimp) saying that it was for MEN ONLY!
