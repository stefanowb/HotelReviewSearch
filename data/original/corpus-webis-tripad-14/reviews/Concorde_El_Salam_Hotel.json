The beach is small but the snorkelling made up for that, the fish were so close and the water so clear it was better than the Barrier Reef. We lost 2 days due to a funny tummy and the immodium do not work on the bug that you pick up there, dirolyte were fine. Due to loosing 2 days, this holiday went so fast, we will go for 10/11 nights or 2 weeks next time instead of just a week. We did the flight to Cairo which after initial difficulties with flights, was a fantastic day. This was down to the group we went with, 7 of us Brits and 2 Norweigens, a nicer bunch of people we could not have wished to meet, so Gary, Marg, Yan, David, Claire, James and who ever else we missed, a big thank you, we will always remember that day and cherish the photos. It pays to shop around for trips and excursions, at the pool the lads with the clip boards and books come round and are cheaper than the authorised reps so shop around.
