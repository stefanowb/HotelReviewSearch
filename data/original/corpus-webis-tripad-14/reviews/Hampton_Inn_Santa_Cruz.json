We were victims of a theft in the parking lot and though the place was actually a decent hotel, this colored our view of our stay. In addition, the price of the hotel was not commensurate with the unsafe environment. When we checked in we told the front desk we had bikes locked in the back bed of the truck. The desk clerk noted that the truck was in full view of the front desk and the desk was manned 24 hours so we should be ok. He did note that IF we wanted to we could take the bikes inside our room. We had been to over 8 hotels in the western region with the bikes in the back (locked down with secure cables) so it made sense that in full view we should be ok here too. This was not the case. In the morning we discovered that one bike seat was missing and the other one had been attempted to be removed. So much for them being \u201cin full view\u201d. The area surrounding this hotel is very seedy so it\u2019s best that every precaution be taken when staying here. We alerted the manager in the morning and made the suggestion that they tell their customers to ALWAYS take their bikes in. The manager said they always suggest this to their customers, but guess the desk clerk that we got didn\u2019t get the memo. If we were to ever visit Santa Cruz again, which is highly unlikely, we might stay here again IF everything else was booked.
