The breakfast was excellent with a variety of meats, cheeses, fresh fruits,and breads. The coffee and hot chocolate were excellent as well. The superior service was definitely what made the hotel so memorable for us. We asked the staff to help us plan a day trip into the Bavarian Alps. They helped us narrow down our choices, provided us with great advice, and even copied train and cable car schedules for us. We chose to go up to the highest peak in Germany and had a fantastic time. The hotel's close proximity to the main train station made it a great vantage point for exploring Munich and it's surrounding areas.
