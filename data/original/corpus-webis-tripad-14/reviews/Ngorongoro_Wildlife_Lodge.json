Reception was a crowded and a little chaotic so took a while to get room keys. Arrived in room which was a little on the small and crowded side, the room was a little run down and the shower did not work well. Beds were hard and not very comfortable and the room was totally dark in the night with no electricity which was dangerous. The restaurant was buffet style and noisy, food was OK but not a huge choice for the evening meal or breakfast. Unfortunatly the weather was cloudy in the morning and drizzly, we left at 0800 so didnt see the view of the crater. Had I seen the grounds and the views I may have had a more favourable impression, without that I would rate the lodge as average which may be unfair.", "title": "OK lodge, but rooms not good", "user": "Maddog186460", "date": "October 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143721547}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Being one of the oldest hotels in Ngorongoro and Serengeti, run by the State, then privatized, all three Wildlife Lodges - Seronera, Lobo and Ngorongoro - have the same feeling of the architecture.
