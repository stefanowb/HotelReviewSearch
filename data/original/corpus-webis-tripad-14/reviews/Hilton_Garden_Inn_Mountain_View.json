I didn't care for the room or the view of the parking lot from the beginning of our stay but was told they were \"sold out\" this is the only room left at 1pm in the Afternoon with an empty parking lot. When we checked in there was no Shower Curtain in the room. We were on our way to a meeting and Desk was in no hurry to replace the shower curtain so it turned into a \"stand off\".. At the end of the day I was late to my meeting waiting for them to bring a Shower Curtain. Also the maid skipped my room on Sunday.
