The bar/saloon is a good place for a snack and drink and the staff is pleasant. The guest rooms are upstairs. We had the misfortune of staying in room #4 - The Bridal Room - which was clean and simple. I first thought that we were lucky, because it is on a side not facing the busy intersection. Then evening came ..... and we noticed the outdoor music \"venue\" directly outside our door. The music was loud until midnight - complete with big speakers, electric guitars, drums playing for an enthusiastic audience.", "title": "Live, LOUD music every Friday and Saturday evenings.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RSFdowser", "date": "June 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 1.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 32394879}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Comfortable Lodging Spot", "text": "This is the second stay we've had at this facility. We often go to the gold country for the Apple Hill season and have stayed a couple different places in the area. This historic lodge has various theme rooms and we've stayed in the Bridal Room and the Ranch Hand room, both of which were comfortable and enjoyable. We enjoy the no TV's in the rooms as our kids like to play board games instead of watching TV. The restaurant downstairs was great food and they had a wide selection for all of us from our three year old to my husband. We received coupons for breakfast at the bakery across the river and had a wonderful time hanging out and reading the newspaper while we had muffins, coffee, and quiche. We came in the fall just after their summer season and they have many events during the summer, like outdoor live music, salsa dancing, etc. but we were there just after their summer outdoor season. Next time we'll go earlier in the year to enjoy these events.", "user": "ahp2008", "date": "January 21, 2008", "id": 12860490}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007", "text": "We got no written confirmation and they never returned our calls when we asked a for a confirmation. When we got there, the place was deserted-no staff or sign of human life. Just stray cats wandering around. We had keys in our doors. Drains were backed up, cracks in the doors, beds were old and uncomfortable. Old beer bottles left on the shelf. The restaurant that they advertise was closed. I had to call several times to get a receipt.
