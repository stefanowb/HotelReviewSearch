The room was a good size and very clean and tastefully decorated, the bed was comfortable. The Hotel decor was in good condition. The staff all spoke english and were very helpful. Not what I expected to find, given other reviews I had read for hotels in Moscow. There was a money change ATM in the foyer set at the government exchange rate. The room service menu was very reasonably priced, and the breakfast buffet was up to the standard you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The hotel is situated close to the metro, and is an easy few stops from the centre of the city's main attractions. We used the hotel driver for our transfers, but this was VERY expensive, and we would use a taxi cab from the airport in future.

The Hilton Moscow is a different story. The hotel is nestled in a very charming heritage building, where you can feel Russian bohemian. Don\u2019t get me wrong- rooms, bathrooms and public areas where on par nowadays needs. Check in took a few minutes as they need to register foreigner, but done with a smile. The Lobby is really impressive and charming. I got a room on the 5th floor with two comfy beds, a huge bathroom with tub and separate shower. The pool is located in the basement- nothing really exceptional but good to have. Nothing really to complain about the basics so far, but Internet access is far to pricey @960RUB for 24hours and there is no turn down service.", "title": "A Hilton with charm!", "user": "dominik_r", "date": "March 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 59258139}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I had breakfast twice in Janus restaurant, which was very nice as the style of the restaurant is different to any other modern 5 star chain hotel as it is the whole hotel.
