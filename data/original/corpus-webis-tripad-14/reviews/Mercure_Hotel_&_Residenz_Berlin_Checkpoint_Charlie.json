The staff are friendly, courteous, helpful and a credit to the owners. This is not a full service hotel, so there is no restaurant but snacks are available at the small bar during the day and evening. However, the breakfast room is of a very high standard and a buffet breakfast at 18 euros has a wide choice of meats, pastries, cereals and fresh fruits as well as scrambled egg, bacon, sausage and more. The location is good, quietly situated, close to Checkpoint Charlie and to the U-Bahn so quick and easy access to anywhere in the city. Unter den Linden is about 15 minutes easy walk. Travel round the city is cheap with an all day group ticket for up to 5 people being especially good value.
