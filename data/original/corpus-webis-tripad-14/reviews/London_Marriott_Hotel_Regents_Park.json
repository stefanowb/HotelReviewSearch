I go to the room to find 2 double beds instead of the king I was guaranteed. Down I go to reception and the girl looks at me and asks if I was sure there were 2 beds in the room and not a king. I think most people would be able to tell the difference. So, again we wait and finally get into our room, First, the in room fridge doesn't work so they bring in one and put it by the closet. Heaven forbid they just switch one out! Next, no toiletries...for FOUR days...even with speaking to the front desk every day. The worst though, was when we had the sheets changed. We get back to the room and head for bed around 11:00pm. I turn back the sheets and there's blood on them! Blood!!! I had to put towels down in order to sleep in the bed. I complain the next day and guess what I'm told...they've got some new housekeeping staff. Come on! An idiot would know that if you've got blood on a fresh sheet, don't just leave it...change it!!
