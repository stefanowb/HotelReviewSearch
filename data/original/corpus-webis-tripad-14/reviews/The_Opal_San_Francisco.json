It was a pre-Christmas present for him as he'd never been in the city before, and I wanted a hotel that represented the local flavor. I got an excellent deal at the hotel's webpage, and even though the reviews were mixed, I chose it because of the location, the breakfast and the fact that it was an old building. The room we got was in a pristine state, very cozy and warm. Brad, the nice gentleman at the Front Desk, was very friendly and very helpful. The dinner adjacent to the hotel was a life saver and when we asked for a bottle opener it was delivered to our room in less than 10 minutes. Although sometimes you could hear your neighbors, it was nothing disturbing. Parking was easy and inside the property, and yes, they charge $28/day but it is San Francisco. Both of us work for a hotel in San Diego, and were very pleased with the place and the staff.
