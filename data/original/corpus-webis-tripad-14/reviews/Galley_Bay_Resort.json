We started out in a beachfront cottage (Room 5) but were unhappy with it, notably a bad smell wafting from the gap at the side where the hotel watersports and boats were. The room was tired and had little space for our clothes. We spoke to the hotel general manager, Mr Foreman. He was fantastic and without hesitation transferred us to a lovely deluxe suite,saying he only wanted happy guests. From then on we were delighted with the hotel. The staff are amazing without exception. The management team are always in attendance (discretely), the restaurant and barstaff are cheerful and super efficient. We loved the relaxed atmosphere and the safe environment. The grounds are impeccable, the beach pristine, and the facilties excellent. The food in the Seagrape restaurant was a real surprise - thankfully no nasty DIY buffets and an excellent menu choice each meal. Dining in the Gaugin restaurant is very romantic but you have to make a reservation on the day you want to eat there(no extra charge) Premium wines and spirits are included (excellent) and as the bars were almost always very quiet there was plenty of time to enjoy the best rum punch in the Caribbean. No-one dresses up for dinner, smart casual is as formal as it gets. For us, no children about the place was a super bonus (been there - did that - kids now grown up!) We specially loved the absence of jetskis, hawkers and raucous noise (no piped \"muzak\" in the restaurants bars etc.) In short a really wonderful chillout in a really lovely place.

So let's start with the first major issue they seriously need to knock down the superior beach front rooms, I think they are numbered 1 - 10. We were in room No.7 I asked the lovely lady at reception I hope we have a nice suite available for us as it was our honeymoon, \"oh yes she replied, it's number 7, right on the beach, although some people complain that the sea is too noisy\" I had read some reviews of the noise from the beach on this site but as me and my wife both love the ocean we though these people were being a bit pedantic and I just smiled and said I'm sure it will be fine. Arriving at No. 7 my first impression was that this was a very basic room, everything was a bit dated a bit grubby, the bathroom was also dated and naff. I was upset that I had upgraded to this from a Gaugin cottage, but the setting on the beach was magical, even though the waves did look kind of rough! Though after a long flight we just wanted to unpack and chill out. Anyway the next two nights were horrendous, the sound of the crashing surf, which at times the water almost reached our back door, was like a jumbo jet taking off and was incessant! Both my wife and I hardly slept at all, even with my ipod on I could still hear the sea! There was no escape from it we felt like we had been on a ship in a storm for two days, even at the Sea Grape restaurant, your are right next to the crashing surf. I found out later that the sea was slightly rougher than normal as Montserrat had erupted a few day before, but even when the sea did 'calm' down the noise was still bad. So on the second day, I complained and at first we were told we had to pay \u00a3900 for the remaining seven days to upgrade to a beachfront suite and were not even offered a discount to upgrade from the normal rates, I refused, as I believed that the \u00a35,000 I had paid already should have secured us accommodation of a reasonable quality! So eventually with my wife distraught and both of us prepared to pack our cases and leave, if they couldn't get us alternative accommodation, we had a meeting with the manager Mr Foreman, he was great and moved us for free to a ground floor premium suite with double glazing No. 77- it was heaven to close those doors and be able to have a peaceful nights sleep! Although the suite we upgraded to must have been three times the size of our original no.7 I still don't believe that it was worth the $1,200 a night rates they were charging. From reading other reviews and speaking to other guests they seem to have a lot of problems with these premium beach front rooms! Still on the negative is the mini bar issue, to only have it filled up once during your stay is pathetic, for what you pay this is just not on. If you want to take cocktails, beer etc back to your room you have to take the silliest little plastic cups. They really need to get larger plastic cups for taking away drinks from the bars. The beach is beautiful, but the sea was too rough, out of ten days, I managed to snorkel once and even then when I was diving down to the bottom I had to fight against the surge of the water to stay in one place. I had visions of strolling into calm, sparkling blue water...oh well never mind. The circumnavigation trip was good fun and the trip to Shirley heights was also a laugh. We were going to hire a car for a day but what we saw on the way to Shirley heights, of the roads and the towns we decided against it, it looked pretty shabby, for all the tourist dollars that come into this island, it certainly doesn't get spent on infrastructure. On the good points the food was great, never a bad meal. Service at times was slow but never too bad and besides, most days we had nowhere to go, so what's the hurry! The cocktails awesome and I thought the wine served was ok. Sitting on the rocking chairs in the early evening, drink in hand was awesome. The spa was nice, though pretty expensive. Also beware that you won't see the sunset at Galley Bay, as the headland to the left of the bay blocks it out, another thing I had been excited about but was disappointed, though we did see one sunset at Shirley Heights. Also be prepared for Antigua's airport, 2 hours of queuing at immigration, no air conditioning, you get the picture! I am baffled as to why so many people return here, I am glad I experienced it, but there are better places to go, with better value.", "title": "This place needs some changes...", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Bomberlow", "date": "January 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 23995644, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Food", "disliked": "\u2014 Our rooms, the rough sea and no free mini-bar!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just spent a week here on honeymoon.", "title": "Great Setting, Average Service", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "larmarIreland", "date": "January 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 23821135, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Private pool", "disliked": "\u2014 Restaurant Service"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "It's a wonderful setting, lovely beach, nice gardens, lake & grounds.", "title": "Still a Great Place", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Avidhiker", "date": "January 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 23706849, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the beach, size of the room, and views", "disliked": "\u2014 consistancy of food preperation"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Had a gaugin cottage which we loved, ours was very private which helped, some of them looked a little bunched together.", "title": "Relaxation and Beauty Surrounds", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "HedoHP", "date": "January 16, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23620492, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beautiful location, great service."}}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 29, "average": 78, "very good": 268, "terrible": 24, "excellent": 1187}, "aka": "Galley Bay Hotel St. John`s", "slim_ranking": 0.2, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}}
