We are respectively 67 and 64 and reasonably fit. While the hotel has changed hands the spirit of the place continues and it remains a gem. This is a boutique hotel located smack dab between the main art museums, the ConcertBouw and Vondel Park, (also close to Leidseplein) in a really nice, safe, upscale and quiet section of Amsterdam. All the above tourist features are within easy walking distance. The # 2 Tram stops a half block outside the door and this makes your eventual travels into the centre and around the city a breeze. The second floor stairs are steep, but this is true everywhere in Amsterdam. A hotel offering an elevator is simply another kind of hotel. If you need that, go elsewhere. The hotel staff are terrific and will have all the answers you need as well as some advance tickets to events. The hotel offers a European style buffet breakfast at by most standards nominal extra cost per day. This is quite good and highly recommended. Generally the rooms are small as this is the Netherlands, but are nicely equipped and super clean. The hotel recently bought the property next door and they are converting it to more rooms. We stayed for four nights in a very large new upper floor room. The streets are quiet after ten pm and still safe to walk. Unless you really like a lot of noise and hub-bub you may regret staying at hotels located in major squares or right in the core as Amsterdam runs 24/7. The location also makes getting to the airport a breeze. Any cab can get you there in 20 minutes for 30 Euros. Stay a few nights and pay in advance for better rates. Strongly recommended for like-minded couples, weary travelers and business people.", "title": "Hotel Zandbergen", "user": "Biddle007", "date": "October 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 179821735}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here as part of a group from work and enjoyed it thoroughly.
