The bathroom appeared to have been recently updated and had a full-size bathtub, great towel warmer, and nice toiletries. The hair dryer was rather unique but \"served the purpose.\" We were served a delightful complimentary breakfast each morning of freshly baked rolls, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juice, and wonderful espresso or capuccino each morning by the \"breakfast ladies.\" The location of the hotel was great, with the walkway into the hotel probably less than 50 yards from the Grand Canal at the San Stae vaporetto stop. We were glad that we'd been warned that the sign marking the place to turn into the hotel was \"tiny\" or we probably would have missed it. We asked one of the other guests there what they recommended that we see as \"first-time visitors,\" and they said to \"just get lost\" and enjoy the neighborhoods and sights of Venice. We found beautiful squares and amazing churches, MANY unique bridges, and plenty of interesting shops and sidewalk cafes by just aimlessly walking in the area surrounding the hotel. Venice is small enough that we were still only 20 minutes or so away from Saint Mark's Square or any other part of Venice that we cared to visit. We found many areas to purchase Murano jewelry (with competitve prices to Murano itself), wonderful leather goods, and amazing pizza and gelato.

It seems very cramped but it is not once you realize it has everything you need. It is in a great location (walking distance from everything). The rooms are rich in colour but you have every emenity you need. They are very clean. You have to remember you are in tight quarters anywhere in Venice. This hotel has a lovely breakfast terrace with wonderful food. You eat and get right on your way. There are no lounge areas here. You can walk everywhere or take the valporetta. Remember to eat at the restaurants off the beaten path. They have wonderful food and 1/4 of the price. If you are looking for sun and beach for a day, go to Lido.
