Check in was fast - we reserved a king room on the highest floor (6) with courtyard view. The room was tiny and it felt humid even though the air conditioning was on. It didn't smell as bad as the front desk but it didn't have a clean feeling either. Walking down the hall it looked and felt more like a Best Western or Days Inn, instead of a category 5 Marriott. Yes the bathrooms are small, but not so bad. It felt more like we were in a cabin on a cruiseship instead of a resort in Aruba but I know it was b/c we reserved a courtyard view - we had a view of the hallway and lobby. I think this hotel needs some major renovations. It wasn't as noisy as other reviews said - i think it was b/c we were on the highest floor. The worst part of the room was I started noticing little red bumps on my arms and ankles. They got really itchy and they swoll up to big red bumps. I thought it was just mosquitos but then my husband was getting bitten too. So we lifted the sheets and found a few tiny bugs with wings on them!! It was really gross. I slept on towels the rest of the trip. Bottom line....our room felt dirty, damp and just not fresh like a typical marriott room in the US. I am not a picky vacationer...I know sometimes quality is not as good as the states when you travel outside the US unless you pay a lot of money but this really was not worth the money.

I am completely baffled as to why no one is mentioning the fact that the private island is directly in front of the airport!!!??

I'm talking trees shaking, birds flying out of the trees, can't hear yourself think loud - EVERY 15 minutes or so! I can not figure out why no one is mentioning this so I HAD TO add my 2 cents. Besides, there was trash floating in the water of the private island (and in the water out front of the Ocean Suites beach as well). For whatever reason, they have their beach water blocked off from the rest of the ocean with rocks, so that it's like a pool or a pond. We rented a jeep to check out a bunch of hotels and found that the beaches by the Bucuti and the Occidental were much more beautiful and authentically tropical. The Renaissance beaches appear man-made and \"fake\" compared to the others. On a positive note, the location is great if you like to be in the middle of it all. Great food - great bars.
