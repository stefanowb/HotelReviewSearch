It is a very modern 4* hotel, about 40 min bus drive from Landvetter airport. Buses are very well scheduled and go exactly on time (like every other transportation in Sweden). Hotel Gothia Towers is at bus first stop on Massans Gata square. Everything in the hotel is fantastically organized for business purposes (you can go through hotel lobby to Goteborg Convention center which was very convenient for me). Very professional and kind staff, high speed Internet in the rooms and in the lobby, business rooms with access 24/7 if you don't have a laptop or you need to print something. My room was located on the West towers 6th floor with lovely sight on the square, very clean, spacious, with everything you may need (even iron and iron board). Breakfast was the same every day, but with excellent choice of different meals. On the 23th floor is Haven restaurant, very modern, clean, food is excellent (obviously expensive), and it has a fantastic sight on the city of Goteborg. Cultural and shopping area and port of Goteborg is approximately 15-20 min walk from the hotel, you can use public transportation (exactly on time) from the square. Across the street from the hotel is Lieseberg amusement park, I regret for not seeing it due to my lectures, because in September it is open only Fri-Sun.", "title": "Very comfortable, well positioned hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "miramar78", "date": "June 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 33034571}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good hotel", "text": "Highly recomend this hotel.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "niceDelhi", "date": "April 30, 2009", "id": 29111733}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Gothia Towers, one of nice hotels I ever visited.", "title": "A Swedish Treat", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "RicsterDeluxe", "date": "April 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28101592}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Nicely maintained rooms.", "title": "Big Hotel - Nice Rooms - Good Food", "user": "Baxie", "date": "April 6, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 27530685}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in March 2008.
