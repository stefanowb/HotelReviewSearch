I booked a circular suite (7th floor - the highest one available) because of a) a king bed, b) the view and c) the soaking tub. The hotel is extremely calm and peaceful, and it smells good everywhere you go. What really sets it apart, though, is the service. My husband and I are here celebrating our anniversary. I mentioned this when booking the room. We arrived 3 hours before check in, and the woman at the front desk was extremely friendly and polite. As it turned out, our room was ready (we were expecting to have to store our luggage). The view of the bay bridge is absolutely incredible. Around 10 minutes after we got into our room, (the luggage was brought up immediately following), a bellhop arrived with a bottle of sparkling wine, glasses, a plate with strawberries, grapes, dates, a fresh apricot and apple and a card that said how much the hotel appreciated our staying there. We (of course!) drank and ate, and then wandered out to the ferry building and down the Embarcadero. We returned a few hours later to find a vase filled with fresh flowers, roses and stargazer lilies (I think...I'm no flower expert but they smell really good) and a handwritten hallmark card wishing us a happy anniversary and signed from the housekeeping staff. We felt incredibly well taken care of and are so impressed at how far everyone went out of their way to make us feel special. As all of the previous reviews have stated, the bath products smell better than anything, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The automatic shades are awesome too - the sun would have woken us waaaay to early if not for those. One last note - we do not regularly spend $700. on a hotel room - this was a splurge for our anniversary. We will be returning to SF after a conference and staying at thbe 4 Seasons (also a splurge for us). I have doubts that they could ever beat our experience here....but we'll see!

My complaints lie with the staff. While housekeeping and the man who brought extra pillows were exceedingly nice, everyone from the doormen, front desk clerks, concierge, valets, and bell hops seemed to be either too busy or too cool to be helpful. A word of advice to the doormen, if you don't want to open doors even for pregnant women with arms full of packages, perhaps you should look for a different line of work. Further to the valets, forty five minutes to retrieve a car is unacceptable. If you're looking for a place to see and be seen, perhaps this is the place for you.

They knew the problem right away--the room was next to electrical equipment and the elevator. They knew exactly what they were doing when they put me there. I have to think it was because I purchased through Expedia, because when I confirmed the reservation they said \"Oh, I see you used Expedia.\" Anyway, most of the rooms abut the Embarcadero, which is a six lane highway. This is not a quiet hotel. The room service is limited and expensive. A simple order of a 16 oz. container of coffee is $19--after mandatory tip, service charges and tax.
