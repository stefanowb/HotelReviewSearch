The best part is this hotel is right in the heart of DC, you can walk to everything, the White House is 5 minutes away, literally. The hotel sits right next to a DC metro station (subway) where you can get anywhere. There are also a ton of great restaurants right nearby. Everything in DC is expensive, I mean there is no point in carrying $1's or $5's or even $10's, it seemed like everything was at least $20 or more, lol. Ok maybe I am exaggerating, but it is expensive. HOWEVER all that is made up for with all the free tours. All of the Smithsonian museums including air and space are free, tours of the Capital engraving etc, ALL free! Always check to see if you need to make a reservation though, many attractions require a few weeks to a few months notice, you can't juist show up to the White House and get a tour..", "user": "Rodrik1970", "date": "January 10, 2013", "id": 149318889}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is the 4th Club Quarters location we have used having previously stayed in London, Chicago and Boston.
