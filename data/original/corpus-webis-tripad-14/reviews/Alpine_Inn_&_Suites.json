The rooms are circa-1960s but spacious, clean, and comfortable. Check-in was painless, and the free continental breakfast (toast, juice, coffee/tea) was a plus. The staff were very helpful, and we received free passes to the local swimming complex. While in Revelstoke, we saw a movie at the restored heritage cinema downtown, and also took a drive on the Meadows in the Sky parkway (absolutely breathtaking scenery). Would stay here again. Good value for your tourist dollar.", "title": "Clean, quiet, good location -- older-style motel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "WBinBC", "date": "July 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8253048, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Quiet and good location", "disliked": "\u2014 Rooms need some major updating"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "The Alpine Inn looked a bit basic when we arrived and some of the furniture was shabby.
