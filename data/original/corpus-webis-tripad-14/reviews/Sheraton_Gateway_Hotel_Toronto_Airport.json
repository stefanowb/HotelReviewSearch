I was alone, exhausted, starving, pissed off and pretty shocked by what had just happened to me. So i decided to at least treat myself with a night at the Sheraton (wasn't in the mood to go on a mission downtown) and luckily i could experience first hand the world famous Canadian hospitality! Mega props to Rosario at the desk and Anthony at the Mahogany Bar who were so nice and helpful. Other than that, the hotel is your typical business/classy airport hotel, super comfy and clean bedroom, yummy breakfast at the 8th floor lounge, comfy couches in the lobby where i was able to kill time while waiting for my return flight (free wifi!), etc. I never meant to stay at the Sheraton but eventually i'm glad i did :)", "title": "Sheraton basically saved my otherwise totally ruined weekend!", "user": "Kicket", "date": "May 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 160317767}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Large, quiet room with extraordinarily comfortable bed.
