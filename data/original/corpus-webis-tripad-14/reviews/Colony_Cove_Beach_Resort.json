The purpose of my stay was a combination of business and pleasure, escaping the Danish winter while working for my Danish clients. For this type of stay there are obviously other requirements than for a usual vacation. To me it was of great importance that I could have a normal household, i.e. do my cooking, laundry, cleaning etc. This condo has all kitchen utensils required for cooking! It also has a washing machine and dryer, which was absolutely essential to me. I did the cleaning myself, and the necessary equipment for this, too, was available.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "279", "date": "April 26, 2013", "id": 158885639}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Condo \"yes\" reef, \"no\"", "text": "One thing I had some concerns about prior to my stay was the internet connection. Would I be able to connect? How would connectivity be? I did have some problems, but the local IT guy was very helpful in helping me get connected. However, the current WiFi signal is not very strong and capacity is limited. This means that the best spot to work from was actually on the patio where I would be facing the transmitter directly. There was no signal beyond the living room, i.e. I could not connect from the bedrooms. I heard that fibre optics cabling has been installed right at Colony Cove, it is just a matter of wiring the units.

To find 12 full bottles of rum on the top of the fridge all for our enjoyment with the only stipulation being, \"If you finish a bottle, please buy another to replace it\" just knocked our socks off.

The complex has been renovated and painted and seems to be in top shape. There is a nice pool, a lovely tropical garden and of course a beach. The staff was very helpful, especially Liz in the office. We loved walking on the beach and snorkeling around a manmade reef in the bay. The bay is protected by a coral reef so the waves are small and it is very easy to snorkel. We saw rays in the sand and lots of colorful fish. The location of the complex is very good... just 5 minutes to Christiasted. There were 2 grocery stores on the main street so we could easily cook in the condo. We had a wonderful dinner at Breezes which is just up the beach. We stayed in 102D which is right on the beach. It is a clean, well equiped condo and the view of the beach and water is spectacular. The condo looks like it has been completely renovated with new bathrooms, kitchen, furniture and applicances We loved having breakfast outside on the lanai, just a few feet from the waters edge. Although it is right on the beach it seems very quiet and private. Many days we had the beach to ourselves. A word to the wise, the only building that is oceanfront is the D building. The other buildings have a view of the garden and the pool but do not look directly out on the beach and water.
