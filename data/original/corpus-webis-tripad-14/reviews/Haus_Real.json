Since then the town has changed a bit, going more upscale. Gone are half the souvenir shops, and instead they got 2 new museum buildings, china shops and restrictive traffic/parking rules.

They have both an indoor formal restaurant, and outdoor terrace. When I was there in the summer, they were serving dinner only on the terrace. Even on the terrace they had a large tasting menu, that was very good, and hard to finish it all. Buffet breakfast is being served in the formal indoor restaurant. It has a few choices, mostly cheeses, but very nice an quiet. They have an extensive wine cellar/wine list, and wine celllar visits may be arrangeable these days, though never been on one.", "title": "Well located, but tiny rooms with no A/C", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Swissdiver", "date": "October 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 46486192}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Perfectly good, nice restaurant", "text": "The hotel best feature is its central location (free parking). Reception closes overnight, but seems to be open quite late. The family occupies the few rooms above the restaurant, and the floor above that has the few rentable rooms. Rooms are generally small. The old rooms are in the front, facing the street with a nice view, but have the sink in the room, out of the bathroom. The new rooms are in the back, no windows, but have full service bathroom. The hotel sellable attributes are its dead central location, being able to dine/drink at the luxury restaurant and take the elevator to the room once finished. Last time I tried to book a room in March for a July stay the hotel was sold out already.

About 15 square metres and no A/C (although I went there in October, the room was quite hot). I had to move a piece of furniture to open my bag... Everything was small. And I was alone! According to the price shown in the room (single occupancy, CHF 185, double, CHF 200), they think two guests could share the room! And the floor map showed all the rooms are of about the same size...
