Hotel is rather small, on the main street, close to the beach. Two types of rooms - elite (sea-view) and standard. If you can, choose elite room. Staff is first-class, very polite, efficient, ready to help. Rooms are rather small, but nicely decorated (although lights could be improved, it is impossible to read at night with only bed lamps), spotlessly clean. Rooms are cleaned every day and towels are changed daily as well. Beach is just across the street, price is normal for Italian standards. Breakfast could be improved, there are plenty of sweet options (cakes, croissants and similar stuff), which I am not very fond of, and limited other optins. However, meals for lunch and dinner were first-class, I cannot praise enough the service and quality of food. Hotel offers private garage (10 EUR per day), free wi-fi. I definitely recommend this hotel.", "title": "Wonderful holiday", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shule", "date": "August 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137232238}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with friends", "text": "We booked this hotel via the internet at short notice on a half board basis for a great rate.", "title": "Great hotel......great resort..", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Coggie", "date": "June 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7988995}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Treated like a Queen", "text": "I had visited Rimini as a kid so kind of knew what to expect,Rimini is a wonderfull family resort.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 20, 2005", "id": 3685480}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Emilia-Romagna", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 17, "very good": 21, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 33}, "aka": "Best Western Rimini", "slim_ranking": 0.418244406196}
