Zahia was in Paris during our stay at her wonderful guest house but she was extremely responsive and supportive from initial contact for booking through our stay and even after our return home. Her beautiful courtyard style house was a delight with lovely sitting areas, cascading floral greenery filled with birdsongs, the calls of neighboring sheep, goats and chickens as well as the visits by the friendly, well-behaved resident cat. Our ground floor room with on-suite shower was very comfortable while the upstairs rooms and shared bath also looked very appealing. The staff, Fatima and Bela\u00efd, were very patient with our inadequate French, looking after us very well and providing fabulous meals on the roof terrace in daytime and in a lovely dining room with a fireplace in the evenings. The highlight of our second stay was an unforgettable evening arranged by Zahia for a milestone birthday celebration. The main event was a performance of Berber music and dancing provided by the Roudaniates de Taroudant, a famous, world-toured very talented women's ensemble. This was followed by a wonderful meal for all the musicians and guests complete with a huge birthday cake. Zahia had ensured it would be a really festive event by inviting some of her charming local friends as well as having her staff invite their families. Fatima was the best dancer! Taroudant and its inhabitants provided a wonderful authentic Moroccan experience. We plan to return to Morocco and look forward to staying again at DarZahia.", "title": "Guest house par excellence in Taroudant", "user": "BengalConte", "date": "April 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127867054}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We loved our stay at DarZahia. From the first email with Zahia, the proprietor, to saying goodbye to staff members Younes and Fatima after a perfect one-night stay, everything was a pleasure. Zahia took a lot of time to suggest local excursions and answer questions promptly before we arrived. Younes and Fatima provided the best experience of our trip while we were there. They made us feel completely at home, both at the guest house and in Taroudant. The ambiance was peaceful, with many nooks for sitting and reading or talking and drinking tea, with the resident cat, Bizmat, purring next to us. Breakfast was served by the fire at a big wooden table with lots of design books for leisurely reading--just what we needed on a cool morning in the desert. We wished we could have stayed much longer and hope to go back next year.
