There is aslo a hospital emergency room a few blocks away,but the construction is such that we heard nothing from the street inside our room. We loved the way the room was designed with one thing that wasn't quite right. The air conditioner unit (controlled by wall thermostat) is located under the window. Because of the suite design there is a partial wall between the bed area and the living room area. Most of the cold air would trap behind the wall making the bed area like a freezer and the living room area comfortable. The real problem was the bath. No fan and none of the cooler air was making it toward the hallway end of the room, so the bath never dried off and it took quite a while for mirrors to unfog.", "title": "Comfortable, clean and a great staff", "user": "Evansthecat", "date": "September 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117631603}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010", "text": "The bedding and the bed itself was beautiful and comfortable.
