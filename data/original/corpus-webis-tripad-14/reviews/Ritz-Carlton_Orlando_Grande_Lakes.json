It is a lovely hotel, with beautiful public spaces, excellent service. My room was clean and spacious. The decoration is luxurious without being over the top. I ate in the lobby lounge one night and the food was delicious, and quickly presented by a gracious and attentive server. However, a Ritz should feel like a Ritz in all respects, since my company was certainly paying Ritz prices! If I had been paying for the room myself, I would have been taken aback by the following: (1) There was a huge stain on one of the bedspreads. Yuck! (2) The cushions and table on the balcony were covered with bird poop. When I turned the cushions over - more bird poop. The night I arrived, I spent some time sitting in the lovely night air. The next morning, I took a look at the balcony and observed with dismay what I had been sitting in. (3) Very few HD television channels. This is always annoying when an HDTV is provided, with the stretched, pixellated picture that results. In a Motel 6, I accept it. In the Ritz, I expect more. (4) The internet service was terrible. If I had been paying the $13/day, I would have been irate, and I did contact my company's event planners to suggest they ask for a refund. I was expected to hurry back to my room at breaks and in the evening to catch up with work. The wifi signal was weak (on my laptop - my phone couldn't even find it), VERY slow, and dropped very frequently. Much of the time it was down more than it was up. One morning at 10 AM, it worked pretty well, so apparently the problem was that the bandwidth wasn't up to it. (There was also an ethernet cable and jack in the room, but they didn't function.) I had a conversation with the hotel manager about it, who apologized and acknowledged that he was aware of the problem. I don't know whether that's good or bad - they admit they have a problem but haven't fixed it. If you're going to host giant conferences, you should be able to accommodate the needs of those attending the conference. I turned off my laptop and watched the World Series, so no great loss for me - but my company did NOT get its money's worth. As I told the hotel manager, if a Budget 8 motel can include free wifi service that is dependable and strong, then there can only be two reasons for the Ritz to CHARGE for it: either it is because they can get away with charging for it, or because they are providing a premium service.
