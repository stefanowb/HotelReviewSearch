We also thought it very nice that as we were leaving our floor, the cleaning person said it was a pleasure having us here and that she hopes to see us again. She will. The management was great too. We had a great view and the room we needed, all thanks to the Guest Relations Coordinator. I also liked the updates to the Art Deco hotel that still maintained its character and the location is great - just north of South Beach to avoid the traffic and noise and throngs of people, but close to walk (for us, might be a little too long for some who aren't used to longer walks) and a fairly inexpensive taxi ride.

This was just the begining of exceptional service, a very helpful staff, and a super clean hotel. The room was a bit small, facing Collins ave. but you don't go to Miami to Stay in the room. The breakfast buffet was great, with a nice selection of fresh food. We did not eat at the resturant on the premises, so I can't comment on their food. the pool area is very nice and clean, and they actually have a deep end to the pool. Make sure to get there early though so you can claim a lounge chair. The beach across from the hotel is a nicer alternative, not too crowded, and swimmable. The only small issue I had was a mistake on charging my credit card for $118 which I noticed on my bank statement after I got home. It only took one phone call for them to remedy the situation.
