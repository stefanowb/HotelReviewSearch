The concierge did so, and found that the number was disconnected. And that was that. There was no offer to help us find an alternate tour, no recommendations, no help of any kind.

I was very impressed with the recommendations of the restaurant staff and enjoyed the meal immensely. As others have mentioned, the rooms are great, especially the bathrooms with separate tub and shower.

A truly beautiful hotel - how much of this is due to the original design and how much to skilful and sensitive renovation isn't apparent - but that's why it succeeds. You'd think it had always been like that. Thoroughly professional staff, excellent food - it's all been said before but it's true. No sign of the ugly prostitutes mentioned by a previous reviewer but the quiet streets between the main town square were a little offputting after dark - but no more so than in any other capital city. Prices are reasonable for this standard - We'd suggest that you book online using the hotel's own website - there were deals for paying up front, etc. Good buffet breakfast, hot food to order. This is beginning to look like an advert but it's geniune - there really is not a single nit to be picked about this lovely hotel.", "title": "Zagreb's best!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Feckenhamsters", "date": "June 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132912004}], "location": {"country": "Croatia", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 15, "average": 32, "very good": 168, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 693}, "aka": "Regent Esplanade, Zagreb Hotel Zagreb", "slim_ranking": 0.0363636363636, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "Esplanade Zagreb Hotel features 208 spacious and lavishly furnished rooms and suites.
