My wife and I used the train to Berchtesgaden, as we are backpackers. There are town buses that run from the Berchtesgaden bus station to the hotel; however, they are only hourly, the last one leaves the town at 6:15pm (pretty early), the fare is quite hefty (almost 3 Euro pp one way for a 9 minute ride!) and there is still a 10-minute steep walk back down the road to the driveway and another 5-minute steep walk back up the driveway to the hotel. If backpacking, don\u2019t plan to have any nightlife in Berchtesgaden and have an early dinner to make the last 6:15pm bus.

Perhaps someone older may disagree with my assessment, but the best way I can explain it is that the hotel appears not to have changed since perhaps the 60\u2019s, and if the owners were trying to retain the original feel of the place from an era gone by, some of the d\u00e9cor works but some certainly needs upgrading.", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Will W", "date": "December 1, 2004", "id": 2858252}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Absolutely the Most Wonderful Place to Stay", "text": "When making the reservation for the room, there were two options: 62 Euro for shared bath or 92 Euro for private. My wife and I felt that shared bath was OK, and given all the great reviews on TripAdvisor, we went for the 62 Euro room. I cannot comment on what you get for the 92 Euro price, and based on the other reviews, my guess is that they are much better rooms that have balconies and views of the Alps in the front of the hotel, as well as having a private bath. If I had known the differences between 62 and 92 Euro, I would have gone for the 92 Euro rooms. Our room was a major let down. It was #20. Our room faced the parking lot behind the hotel, although we did have a view of Hitler\u2019s Eagles Nest if we angled ourselves properly to look out the small window. Walls were totally stark white with one needlepoint picture for d\u00e9cor. Although it was a \u201cdouble room,\u201d the beds were aligned one in front of another rather than next to one another, and the room was not even wide enough to put our beds together, so my wife and I slept apart. I think my biggest frustration was having to be in the room early, and knowing there are magnificent views from other rooms in the hotel that I wasn\u2019t getting. Additionally, based on the number of cars in the parking lot, people at breakfast in the morning, and people walking around the hotel, it was not full. Therefore, my other disappointment was that we were given a room facing the parking lot rather than the front of the hotel, even if all 62 Euro rooms were the same and lacked a balcony.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 11, 2004", "id": 2818795}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Unbelivable", "text": "There were pluses that others have written about and I would echo. The shared bath on our floor was a retreat, as it had a massive, new soak-in tub and very roomy shower. It was adorned in pink, smelled very nice, and was the highlight of the floor. Beds were comfy with nice linens and the in-room sinks were also new. The breakfast in the morning was tremendous, with lots of very good food. Everyone was very friendly in the morning to both my wife and I. There are lots of interesting plaques, certificates, and pictures on the walls. The reason why everyone is drawn to Zum Turken is the history. The hotel was used by the Nazi\u2019s as a Gestapo headquarters and the hotel is right next to a former Hitler residence. You can also tour the bunkers right below the hotel, which is certainly a highlight.
