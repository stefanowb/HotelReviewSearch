Yes, there is no elevator in this 2-story hotel and yes, the breakfast is minimal, both very common features in properties at this star-level. What is expected is a friendly staff, very clean, quiet, up-to-date room, a bed and bedding that is comfortable and a shower with consistent water temperature and pressure and they delivered on all these. If I expect more, I stay at a hotel a tier above a Day's Inn. I especially appreciated the little extra benefit of guest computer in the lobby, having forgotten the power adapter to my laptop. The location with easy access to Highway 16, has a Shari's Restaurant steps away for a more generous breakfast and a DQ for late night treat.", "title": "Good Days Inn", "user": "CouleeCat", "date": "September 1, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 175140089}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Should be called \"Days END\" not \"Days Inn\"", "text": "It went down like this- after driving over 600 miles, all I wanted to do is check in the hotel, sit in the hot tub for a bit, call my kids and tell them I arrived safely, and watch a little TV to unwind. Well, didn't work out that way. After lugging my luggage upstairs (BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ELEVATOR), I tried to use the hot tub that was hot enough to broil lobsters, so I then tried to call my kids on the phone in room but couldn't because it did NOT work, and had trouble trying to watch TV because there was NO REMOTE for the TV! I decided then that I had indeed checked into the hotel from Hell... So, for cheap entertainment, I joined my family in the pool where we could clearly see other people checking in and \"discovering\" that they had NO ELEVATOR (with looks of dismay and bewilderment on their faces because the Clerk DOES NOT TELL YOU THIS WHEN YOU CHECK IN) and had to hike the Battan Death March to their rooms!

He says the room is 85. So the room ends up being 95. The fridge was broken and we were travelling from Nevada and had things to keep cool. The ice machine was broken so we couldnt even add ice to the ice chest. We brought all of this the Jasons attention and he looks at me a shrugs his shoulders. We checked out the next morning with Tylor. She tried to be helpful ornatleast put up the illusion of caring. She said shecouldnt give us any assistance because she didnt have stevens over ride code for the computer but Steven would be in at 8am. She guaranteed he would call my wife and take care of us. As my wife told Tylor, we heard nothing from Steven at all. In fact she called the Hotel all day from her phone and NO ANSWER! She callled from anborrowed phone and Steven answered! She hung up and figured she would deal with it in the morning because we were now boarding the ferry for Canada. My wife called the morning of July 3rd and got Tylor again. She said I told you that once Steven figured we were out of the area we can go pound sand. She told Tylor that we were back in Bremerton and can stop by to see her and Steven to deal with this. GUESS WHAT? SHE HAD A CODE TO REDUCE OUR RATE ACCORDINGLY! WOW! CANT YOU JUST HELP PEOPLE WITH THE EASY PROBLEMS? I AM SURE THERE ARE WORSE ISSUES THAN JUST GIVING US A BREAK INSTEAD OF IGNORING US AND SHRUGGING US OFF!", "user": "mookiex4", "date": "July 3, 2013", "id": 166165541}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled on business", "text": "By the way.... Just skip this over priced dump and go to the Super 8 in Bremerton. They are 30 bucks cheaper. Same accomodations and You have more available around you. The staff is great and Heather printed out all the stuff for us that we can do in the area and she helped us get to Port Angeles to catch the Ferry to Victoria. She even offered to set us up with a room in Port Angeles just in case we didnt want to drive all of the way back so late at night. By the way Heather reminds me of the young brunette woman from the show TWO BROKE GIRLS. Haha. She is a sweetheart.

Hotel has a great location, just across the parking lot is Shari's restaurant, Dairy Queen, and Mc Donald's as well as a gas station. Hotel is 2 levels, no elevator. Hotel appears to be older and rooms are dated. Tired looking blankets, bed spread and towel are very thin, worn and scratchy. No flat screen tv here and no ESPN, has limited tv stations. Recliner in room looks old and not comfortable. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and room came with fridge and microwave. Toiletries are very small bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner, lotion would have been nice. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Housekeeping did a good job keeping the room clean. The free breakfast was excellent, the softest bagels I have ever had, also waffles, hard boiled eggs, muffins, bread, cereal, fruit, and yogurt. Ate a big breakfast every day. Also candy dish at front desk was a nice treat. Have washer and dryer, pool and hot tub. Pool was nice, unfortunately hot tub was not working during our entire stay, was looking forward to soaking in it. Did ask for and get a credit on bill for non-working hot tub.
