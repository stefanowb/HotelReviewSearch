We went to cuba last year but only for a week. We decided to go back this year and went for 15 days. What can we say the food is excellent, there is food for everyone e.g beef, seafood, chicken, ram, lamb, pork...... They did different nights as well, such as chinese night in the buffet with spring rolls, chow mein, szechwan pork and so on, it was lovely. Whilst being there we tried fish soup, ram, red snapper which was a delicate taste but lovely. They have 3 al a carte restaurants, italian , seafood and Cuban. They were all great especially the seafood where we tried octopus. The staff are amazing too, they cannot do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble. When we arrived this year they even remembered us from last year which was nice. When we went last year we went on the speedboat trip. This was very exciting but the snorkelling wasn't too good as you snorkel in the mangroves and the water is a bit murky, although it's still a good experience. This year we went on the catamaran, which was excellent, the snorkelling was better as the water was much clearer and you could see a lot more fish, we were also lucky enough to see dolphins on our way to playa pilar beach which is beautiful and very unspoilt. The food we had on this trip was fresh lobster and prawns done in a garlic dressing mmmmmmmmm. We also went on the lobster sunset at playa flamingo beach. There was a hut we all sat in directly on the beach to watch the sunset whilst enjoying more fresh lobster, prawns, cod, veg and rice which was lovely, especially the lobser. The last trip we went on was called Colourful Cuba. You go over the causeway to the mainland in to a town called moron. Let's just say this really opens your eyes to the fact that although they have very little, they are still happy and freindly. You go on a horse and cart around the town and get to have a look around the shops, if you go to the museum you get a good photo of the town. We also visited a crocodile farm which was a great experience as we held a baby crocodile. He was 2 yr old about a meter in length, so cute. The beach is beautiful too, the sea is like walking into a warm bath and so clear you can see where you step which is nice. To Sum all of this up Cuba is a fantastic country and well worth a visit, we will be going back.", "title": "Out of this world, one word that sums it up is paradise!", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "SAH22", "date": "October 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 10055272, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 You can do as much or as little as you like.", "disliked": "\u2014 Mosquitos, take plenty of reppellent."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "What some people say about this wonderful hotel.Like many others we also read the awful reviews about this hotel!", "title": "Isnt it terrible", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "tonyandmands", "date": "October 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 10043962, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 friendly,clean and happy staff", "disliked": "\u2014 mossies"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Cayo Coco", "text": "Thank god we took no notice and booked probably the best holiday we have ever had.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "shesellseashells", "date": "October 5, 2007", "id": 10042820}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled solo", "text": "Let us assure you... this hotel,its wonderful staff,its cleanliness, delightfull selection of food,and its beautiful location will send you home, like us, totally relaxed and happy to have spent time with the wonderful Cuban people.", "title": "The Best service I have ever experienced", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "Amazonsun", "date": "September 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10013107, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Clean great ammenities", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The entertainment provided especially the captivating romantic evening is as good as you will see anywhere in the world.", "title": "Fantastic Holiday", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "wlew1s", "date": "September 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8864002, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very Spacious", "disliked": "\u2014 Mosquitoes"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed at the Blau Colonial from June 30th to July 14th 2007 for a 14 night stay with my wife and two boys aged 4 and 5.

Also as a side note, I would like to point out that travelling to an all-inclusive resort will be a very different experience whether you travel during high or low-season. The summer is low-season. Nonetheless, the food wasn't amazing. It's food. We came to agree that it was Cuba attempting \"american\" cuisine and sometimes, fell a little short. That is not to say we didn't eat, there was plenty to eat, but I could definitely see a picky eater having a hard time in Cuba. (Also, from what I've heard and from people I've spoken to who have travelled to more than one resort in Cuba is that this is the case in all cuban resorts, their \"fortes\" are not american dishes) I would however like to commend the beach grill at Blau, \"El Ranchon\", their lunch meals are fantastic! At Blau there are also \"international restaurants\": a cuban, an italian and a carribean. These restaurants require a reservation but are quite good. The italian and the cuban were my favorites. The cuban had a banana stuffed chicken appretizer that was absolutely delicious as well as the pesto tomato cheese pie appetizer at the italian restaurant. I also read a few traveller reviews that said they had experienced a few \"stomac difficulties\" and we did as well but we chalked it up to the fact that our digestive systems weren't used to such a change in diet. My suggestion would be to travel with acidophilous bifidus (the good kind intestinal bacteria) which would help keep your intestinal flora at the proper levels. So, unlike some of the reviews here, I wasn't \"outraged\" in the least about the quality of food.
