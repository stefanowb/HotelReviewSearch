My criterea when I was looking for a place included: room to accomidate 4 people, reasonable price, ac, non smoking , decent area. Hotel Bourdonnais met and exceeded my expectations. We had a standard room that had 2 queen beds. We paided 169 US dollars a night plus tax. Booked through our travel agent. The rate did not include breakfast. which was 12 Euros per person extra. Since 48 Euros for a family of 4 to have a continental breakfast seemed unreasonable, we did not try the breakfast. The breakfast/solarium room did look very pretty. Instead we walked next door to the grocery store and bought milk, yougart, and fruit everyday. for about 10 euros total. The bathroom in room 201 was large and modern. The carpetting and bedding looked worn but clean. The beds were comfortable and we slept well. We asked for a non smoking room. 201 did have an ashtray on the table but nothing in the room smelled like smoke, so I didn't see the need to complain. Front desk staff very friendly and spoke english well( except for 1 female clerk who was consistantly rude in multiple languages). We had an early arrival flight and checked in at 11am, no problem.
