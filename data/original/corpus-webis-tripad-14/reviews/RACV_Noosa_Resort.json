We are highly impressed with the level of service & excellent standard they have maintained over that period. If anything it keeps getting better. The whole team could not be more helpful. The rooms are superb and each room we have stayed in has a beautiful view that looks like you are in Kakadu with complete privacy. They consistently deliver the best buffet breakfast you will find. The fruit is always fresh and a huge variety. They will even cook you pached eggs if you want. The new gourmet wood fire pizzas are great, but by far their biggest asset is the amazing team of staff.

It is condo style accommodation. We stayed in a three bedroom penthouse. It was awesome. Clean and very new looking with all modern accessories. The balcony was huge and even had our own second rooftop balcony! The apartment was huge had 3 bedrooms plus an extra room with a photon so plenty of room for all of us. It is the only unit i have stayed in that had 3 bathrooms, 2 of the bedrooms had ensuites! We stayed poolside & the view was lovely. The pool was so nice & was open till 10pm. It even had a tennis court. The only downside was we didn't stay long enough! Will definitely be going back, even thinking of making a regular!
