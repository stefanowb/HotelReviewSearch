The rooms are a little dated but clean. We found it a little weird to have the 2 bedrooms downstairs but the kitchen and the living room upstairs. There is a washer and a dryer in the bathroom. They even provided 2 packs of laundry detergents which was very nice. But we couldn't figure out how to turn the heater on (We thought we had turned it on but no heat was generated) so we were freezing cold at night. Also, this is the only hotel during our Australia trip (7 hotels in all) that did not have any international power adaptor which we found very inconvenient (We were relying on the Google Map on my iPad for driving directions and it needed a charge). They were not open early enough for our early 7am checkout (but no checkout instructions the night before) so we were not able to settle it with cash as planned (trying to avoid the 3% foreign transaction fee). Location wise, it's a bit far from town to get food (most are closed at night anyway) but there's a pier (I think) at the beach right across the street.

The hotel room, although small, was clean and well maintained with a good sized modern bathroom. The wonderful views from the top hotel balconies (for guests only) more than made up for the size of the room and we were able to watch the sunset over a quiet bottle of wine and a comfortable chair. The kitchen has provided some interesting combinations on the menu. Our favourites were the lamb back straps and ling fish accompanied by roast beetroot with a lovely marinade.

Service was excellent, dinner in the restaurant great quality, value and served with attention to detail and great sense of humour. Coffee was perfect ( always important to us and unexpected as most places don't get it right........ probably one of the best cups I\"ve ever had.) We paid $160 for a 3 bed apartment for one night with a $50 voucher thrown in for the hotel restaurant. Add to this the beautiful interior of the hotel for photographs, an invitation for my daughter to play and sing at the piano during checkout and a Welsh flag outside ( alongside Australian and Irish.) The manager adores and is passionate about rugby union ( we are originally from Wales) what more could we ask for for during a whistlestop stay? Can I find any suggestions for improvement? Well if I did it would involve inappropriate upgrades and turning this little beauty into something it isn't. Some people may think it needs a swimming pool or day spa or complain about something or other, people always do. We thought the whole experience was perfect and have stayed everywhere from 5* worldwide to Thai hill village hut. This is the first Trip Advisor review I have been compelled to write.

This is my first TA review, that is how much I thought of this property. Heading to Lorne with two girlfriends for a weekend away I did my research and was astounded at the prices being asked at the two large well known properties in Lorne. Then I came across Grand Pacific Apartments. We had a 2 bedroom ocean view apartment for $175 per night, great price for a great apartment. Number 26, ground floor, lovely view across a lawn to the water. The living room enjoyed all the morning sun. Kitchen very well equipped with things you wouldn't usually find in an apartment eg. grater, colander, range of saucepans. Basic tea & coffee, jams & marmalades supplied. Only negatives were no mirror in the master bedroom and the bathroom fan being very noisy in the second bedroom. Staff were welcoming and professional. The hotel/apartments are located on the Wye River side of Lorne about 10 minutes walk into the main hub along a path following the beach or a made footpath.
