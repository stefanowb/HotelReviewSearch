We were travelling the Oregon coast and found the scenery to be stunning. The location of this motel is right on the coast with waves crashing on the rocks sending dramatic plumes of spray into the air. However, our room obviously had a serious mold problem, the smell blasted you as soon as we opened the door. I mentioned it to the front desk staff and they sent someone with an ozone air purifier but it had little effect so they moved us to another room. The new room was marginally better (see photos), we had to sleep with the windows open all night. It is a serious health risk to let people stay in such poor conditions. Lets face it, the location is so close to ocean, the humidity is high, there is vinyl siding, the rooms are probably not heated properly in the off season, this is the perfect breeding ground for mold in the walls and attic. Now, both rooms were in an older part of the motel complex so I hope they plan to redevelop, there is a new development next door by same owners. I suspect the other reviews listed are for the newer buildings (however, these rooms are more than twice the price). The wing we stayed in should be condemned by the health department. The cleaning and maintenance staff have the toughest jobs here, trying to stay on top of an old building with serious moisture problems.
