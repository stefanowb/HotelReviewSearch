This is essentially a joining of the smaller cicada chorus room and larger Ocean Gallery Suite to form one Enourmous (210m2) and very luxurious suite which would have slept four . We chose to pay (\u00a310 extra per night) for the 2 units in case of nose heard through the adjoining door . The adjoining doors were very heavy and soundproofed but you would still hear some noise from your neighbours ,so take heed if you value your peace and quiet !", "user": "crombiestone", "date": "August 6, 2005", "id": 3741159}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful high quality furnishings", "text": "The suite consisted of two very large bedrooms of similar size ,the master suite having a large circular Jacuzzi bath which was perfect to cool off after being out in the humidity of Phuket and a large central living and kitchen diner area with additional third toilet !.The overall design is modern and minimal. One small criticism was that the TV's were placed in the bedrooms so you could not watch TV from the living area. Outside was a large terrace with fantastic sea views .They have also made a very good job of disguising the roofs of the other units with planting and water .", "user": "hardycards", "date": "June 7, 2005", "id": 3535621}], "location": {}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 6, "average": 15, "very good": 71, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 68}, "aka": "The Aspasia Phuket Hotel Kata Beach", "slim_ranking": 0.276595744681, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.0}, "description": "Recently created in the south of the island of Phuket, The Aspasia is a stylish boutique resort reflecting an unusual retro-deco design with hints of Mayan style architecture.
