There are numerous restaurants in the resort to choose from offering various cuisines, from Italian, Indonesian to Chinese! All were fabulous and excellent value. The staff were amazingly friendly and courteous. The hotel is modern but dated, renovations are being undertaken currently. The room was wonderful, overlooking the ocean, the bathroom however is more like a 3 star hotel standard. Rooms are cleaned daily, our beds were turned down nightly and fruit/water changed too. As we were Regency guests, there were drinks and canapes each evening from 5pm to 7pm with local music provided. You can choose to stay in touch with the outside world or not as daily newspapers are provided. On the lower ground floor there are a number of shops, customer service, money changing service, doctor, internet, gym and of course spa. Bring a few books as lounging by the pools/sea is the predominant pastime - very relaxing with pool service as required. Do spoil yourself at least once by receiving a full Aromatherapy massage! We went to Kuta on one night which was an experience - a bit more night life! We had drinks in the entertainment bar nightly where a band also played. Go whitewater rafting in Sobek - it is excellent value and fun. Should you choose, there is no need to leave the resort for your entire sejour.
