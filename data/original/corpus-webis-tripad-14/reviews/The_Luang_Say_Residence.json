The Hotel is visually appealing, colonial french style buildings nestled among lush vegetations. The staff was extremely professional and helpful. We have never experienced this high quality level of service anywhere. Rose and Ae were duty managers, Edward was the restaurant manager. They were fantastic. The rest of the staff was as good. They always accommodated our requests wholeheartedly, For example, the internet in our rooms was not that fast (building 5), so they immediately tried to fix it. When all their efforts failed, they moved us to different rooms. They made reservations for us at restaurants in town, shuttle us to and from the spa.

It's hard to believe the hotel was newly built because its colonial style is quite convincing! The large pool was very much appreciated as well. The a-la-carte breakfast was one of the best we've had during our trip throughout S-E Asia. We also tried the Laos tasting menu at the Belle Epoque restaurant, which was very good indeed and an outstanding introduction to local food. The wifi is of a decent speed throughout the entire hotel. Finally, what made our stay more than just great was the excellent service of the entire staff.
