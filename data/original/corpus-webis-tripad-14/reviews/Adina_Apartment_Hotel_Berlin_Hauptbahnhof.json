Fabulous hotel! My friend and I shared a twin room on the 7th floor on the first night and for the remaining 2 nights were given a room on floor 2. The original bedroom had twin beds separated by a wall holding the tv with no doors to the living room. However, the 2nd floor room was better. This had a separate bedroom and had a washing machine and tumble drier in the bathroom. For us, it was worth the extra. The location is perfect. Opposite is the Natural History museum (well worth a visit), and minutes from the Underground to the right, or the Hautbahnof train station to the left. This is a fabulous place considering you're there to catch trains. Plenty of shopping and very helpful staff. Can't fault the hotel. What problems there were, were niggly ones, missing corkscrew, flat batteries in remote, having to ask for slippers for the pool and dressing gowns which were in the pool area. I would have preferred to go to the pool in the gown and slippers, but that's a minor point. The kitchen was well equipped, although I didn't like all the clutter in the fridge of the minibar stuff which was prohibitively expensive. Who makes up these prices?! Shopping can be bought from LIDL 7 minutes walk down the road (not open Sundays) but open until 8pm. There's also Kaiser's supermarket at the Hautbahnhof. Washing powder sachets can be bought from the hotel. The rooms were very warm indeed, and the quilts very heavyweight. I ended up taking the quilt out and just using the cover and a blanket,although I'm sure the staff would have given me a sheet if I'd asked. Lovely staff, nothing too much trouble. Kindly let us drop our bags in store after we checked out so we could sightsee. The seating area in the lobby is perfect to unwind before travelling, gorgeous fire and interesting books. Swimming pool and sauna are lovely. Lots of towels, dressing gowns and freebie perfume samples, and open until 11pm. Didn't eat at the hotel, but the corner coffee house does excellent soup, cakes and coffee at very reasonable prices. Will definitely come back here.

When asked why they charged extra for the cot they informed me it was for changing the sheets, well the sheets were not changed once during the 6 night stay - maybe they waivered this service in line with the charge! We were also disappointed to receive a room without a bath, obviously we had a baby yet this was not factored into the booking. The reception staff said that we could borrow a baby bath, but when we requested this they said someone had it and we couldn't have it until the following day, which was very disappointing. Furthermore the kitchenette is very poorly equipped. Expedia described the rooms as having full kitchenette; both our room and my parents did not have any hobs, only a combination oven/microwave. So the idea of steaming my childs food on the steamer which I bought with me went out of the window, I do 90% of my cooking at home on the hob and would describe this as an essential component of a kitchen, so again very disappointing.", "title": "Not child friendly and poor kitchenette", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Doofler", "date": "November 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120663642}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled with family", "text": "In summary do not book this hotel if you want a bath, a kitchenette or a room suitable for a baby.", "title": "Perfect choice for family", "user": "iknowhowitis", "date": "November 16, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 120658662}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "On the other hand if I stayed in the hotel just with my wife I wouldn't have had such complaints so it really depends on your circumstances.
