There was a shower head in the bath but the bracket to hold it on the wall was broken and there was no shower curtain, so sit-down shower was only option.

The staff there was helpful and the hotel was close to the metro and the residential neighborhood was great. We walked around the neighborhood late at night as well and everyone we encountered were very nice and even helped us find a pharmacy. However, the hotel room and bathroom were very small. Barely enough space for two people. The walls are very, very thin and every night we could hear people get up in the middle to use the restroom, we could even hear them shuffling their feet on the way. If you want a budget hotel with nice staff I would recommend it but by no means is this a luxury hotel.", "user": "MJAMSA1", "date": "July 17, 2007", "id": 8135805}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not the Ambassador Hotel!", "text": "Please note: this is NOT the Ambassador Hotel. My wife and I just happened to realize this on the plane on the way to Paris. Thankfully, it is in a fairly convenient location, about five minutes walk from the Metro. There was no noise from outside (though we were there offseason and the windows were closed). The walls are very thin, and you can easily hear people in the next room. The rooms themselves are nothing special. Very very plain. The bath has no shower curtain, thus causing quite a wet mess when showering. The staff was very friendly, but there was a sign near the elevator saying no food or drink in the rooms (however they didn't say a word as we pranced upstairs with a loaf of bread, two bags of apples and cheese, and a bottle of wine). A laundromat is 30 seconds away, and there are many restaurants after walking a short time. Other than that, the neighborhood is pretty dead, which makes for a somewhat ominous presence. My wife was afraid to walk there at night. Overall, it was okay, but we will definitely stay somewhere else next time.", "user": "silsjapan", "date": "January 3, 2007", "id": 6546674}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not recommended", "text": "Room/Carpet was dirty, smelled bad. Shower room was molded, smelled terrible and shower curtain was over >30 centimeters to long. Could not use the phone in the room (old rotary type) half hanging from the wall. Pillows were bad and small. I did not see any Fire Alarms in the room although maybe there could have been some in the hallways. Needed to close the windows at night because of noise but the heat was on and you can't turn it off. It is in a somewhat bad, rough Neighborhood. We were in a group and people standing on the corner 50 meters from the hotel were yelling at our group (the ladies) and even were grabbing at the ladies. Street was dirty and loud. We did not have a vehicle but parking looked impossible. We were in a group or I would probably had tried to move. Breakfast was bread, juice and coffee. Breakfast was ok.
