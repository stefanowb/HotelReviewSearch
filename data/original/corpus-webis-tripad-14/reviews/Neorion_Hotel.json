From check-in and the helpful orientation with Ceyda to our comfortable room and bed, there was an easy and relaxed vibe throughout the hotel. Ceyda and Sirin were the best and most friendly concierges we have ever had the pleasure to meet - always smiling, ready to help or make dinner reservations for us. The front desk staff were also helpful and professional. Then there were the little touches, like the towel elephant that our room attendant left on the bed to cheer us up after a long day of touring...need more pillows, or another blanket...no problem, they were delivered in minutes with a smile. We spent 4 nights there in a superior room on the 6th floor, and it was very quiet, the distant, muffled bells on the passing tram were comforting rather than annoying, and even had a view of the Blue Mosque from our room and balcony, which we were pleases to use one sunny afternoon looking over the rooftops or down at the street life below us. The location is excellent as others have said, perfectly placed to walk to sights in Sultanahmet or to the Spice Market and ferries on the Golden Horn. Do we have any complaints? Softer towels, perhaps, and maybe tea or coffee available in the lobby during the day, but it seems so petty when some much else was perfect. And the bananas and honey along with the rest of the very nice breakfast spread...they were the icing on the cake.", "title": "Bananas and Honey!", "user": "Tom E", "date": "April 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158265164}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Neorion hotel for three nights.

The toiletries in the bathroom were awesome and there was a list of extras you could ask for if you required them. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance of all the major sites and very close to the tram station, from where one could catch the tram to any one of the major destinations and also use it to go quickly and easily to Taksim Square and modern Istanbul. The staff were very helpful and even offered to get an Istanbulkart for the public transport for us if we had any problems. The spa area is very good indeed too.

I \"made my investigation\" on TRIPADVISOR, as I always do, and decided to contact the NEORION Hotel after reading all the raving reviews. My first \"taste\" of the impeccable service of the NEORION was my contact with one of their reservation ladies, lovely Ceydan, with whom I spoke on the phone and exchanged e-mails several times, which made me look more forward to our visit every time! So today I would like to add one more review to all the positive things that have been written until now. Everything in the hotel was excellent. We all wished we could have stayed longer than the three nights. We felt we were guests at a friend's house from the moment that we were greeted on the door with freshly squeezed juices and the smiling faces of Cagdas and Ceyda to the minute we left for the airport to fly back home The night concierge, I think his name was Fatih, as well as EVERYBODY in the hotel were the most friendly, nice, efficient and smiling people I have met. The reason I am not mentioning ALL their names, is only because I would need to have paper and pen in my hand all the time! The breakfast buffet, the afternoon meze, the complimentary abundant non alcoholic juices etc were only a small sample of the lovely service. It is a small, clean, hospitable hotel with all the possible amenities, in a very nice and convenient location. They also have a hamam and spa with a VERY good masseur, Oktay, who does a wonderful job. I hope we will soon come back to this wonderful \"home\" for us, as it really feels like home, once you enter the establishment.
