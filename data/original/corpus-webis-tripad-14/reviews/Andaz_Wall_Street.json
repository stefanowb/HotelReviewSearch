Drove from Boston, and not having been to NY for many years, wasn't sure staying in FiDi was the best idea, but it was. Room was ready when we arrived at noon, so we were able to freshen up, don our sneakers, and get walking! Room was spacious enough, only complaint is the bathroom lighting is dim. Beds a bit hard, but just fine. The area is quiet on a Sat/Sun, but we liked that. Never heard a thing, although the reality is, we weren't in the room a lot! Staff VERY helpful and pleasant. Parked the car next door at Imperial Parking, rate is $34/day. Subway short walk, so very easy to get anywhere from here. Breakfast is a bit pricey, but was delicious. I am very happy we didn't stay in Times Square, as many recommended in order to be closer to the \"action\". The action wasn't as appealing to me as the quiet sanctuary needed after a long day of sightseeing and walking!
