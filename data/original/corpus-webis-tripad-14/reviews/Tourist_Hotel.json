This property exceeded our expectations in many ways. Not only was the price very reasonable for our room for four, but the location on the river was ideal (many rooms, including ours, feature a view of both the city and nearby mountains). The hotel is not far from the main train station (although for us it was a bit more than the \"ten minutes walk\" indicated when we reserved a room) and other in-town attractions; laundry facilities are on the premesis; and the owners & staff were very friendly and helpful. Most of the clientele are young, but there were a few other families also staying there during our visit in June.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "BeerNBikes", "date": "July 5, 2006", "id": 5427764}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Five Stars for a hostel", "text": "I loved this place. Sure, it doesn\u2019t compete with a standard hotel, but for a hostel, it was fantastic. Our room was clean. We had a private room which had four beds in it, although there were only three of us. The beds were pretty comfortable. The linens were OK, but clean. We did not have a private bathroom, however, we found the public restroom and showers to be clean and adequate. The best thing about our room was the balcony over looking all of Lucerne. It was fantastic! Not all the rooms have balconies, so try and make a request\u2014it is worth it. It is a great place to sit and read or have a cigar. Breakfast was better than expected\u2014meats, cheeses, breads, yogurts, cereal, juices. The location of the hostel is perfect. It is right along the river which runs through Lucerne. From the hostel (if you have a balcony), there is a great view of the river and the mountains near Lucerne. All of the city\u2019s sights are within walking distance. The station is about a 10-15 minute walk. The only negative was the noise in the morning. The other guests were very loud during the 6:00am hour, partly because they were slamming the bathroom door. The best thing about the hostel is the value! It was the cheapest place we stayed in Europe. We loved it!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 8, 2006", "id": 5324760}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "Didn't expect much after seeing the photos on its website, but the room turned out to be very pleasant. We had a double room with private shower on the 4th floor, facing the back, not the river. The bathroom was big and so was the room. There was no TV even though the reservation confirmation stated that the room would come with a TV. The hotel is ideally located. Breakfast was average, not a wide variety but reasonable.

We stayed in a double room which was at the end of the corrridor of dorm rooms. The room was spacious and clean, the bathroom was fine too and our room opened onto a small paved area with a little garden that overlooked the river. Such a great room! The man working on reception was brilliant, really helpful and friendly and he even let us use the kitchen microwave to warm up some dinner. Apaprently the rooms upstairs are very nice too. One bad thing - being at the end of the dorm hall we heard a lot of banging doors early in the morning - but that's what you get with dorm rooms, really not a huge deal and shouldn't put you off.

It's a very friendly, progressive, and safe hotel. The front desk woman went out of her way to give us info on Lucerne, local excursions, and other activities. We had a room on the 4th floor, with a private shower, facing away from the river. Very peaceful and quiet. The room's decor is dorm-like and simple -- but then again, half the building IS a dorm for Univ. of Lucerne students. We had no complaints about the bed or bathroom -- everything was functional and modern. There was no phone, TV, or AC, and we didn't miss any of those things (temps were quite cool while we were there).", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "gengrace", "date": "August 25, 2004", "id": 2492703}], "location": {"country": "Switzerland", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 19, "average": 54, "very good": 81, "terrible": 13, "excellent": 44}, "aka": "Tourist Hotel Lucerne", "slim_ranking": 0.540983606557}
