The hotel was recently acquired by Sheraton so is undergoing some renovations. We had a room on the 10th floor that had clearly been recently renovated. Beds were comfortable, room was very clean, a/c worked well, free wifi was nice and had a great connection/speed. I was happy to find additional electrical plugs in the lamp bases to charge all our various electronics rather than having to dig behind a dresser or something. The restaurant had a good breakfast buffet that was reasonably priced for hotel food. The staff was extremely nice and helpful and it is a very short trolley ride to Beale Street. There is not much immediately around the hotel to do wise, which is why I didn't give it 4 stars. If you are going to the convention center though, this is an excellent choice because its right across the street.", "title": "Good Choice in Memphis", "user": "vlfair", "date": "January 1, 2014", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 189279954}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "A little bit of a walk to Beale Street but it's still a great location.

We planned to stay in Memphis for two nights on our return trip back to WI, the second night being NYE. We arrived at the hotel after a long 6 hour drive from east TX. Upon first entering the room, everything seemed great. I even commented on the fact that the room SMELLED clean. Bed looked nice, bathroom was clean, nice TV, nice view, etc. I decided to take my laptop out and get some work done. That's when I smelled something very sour. I kept looking around but couldn't quite pinpoint it. Less than a half hour later, I was tired so put the laptop down and pulled the covers up near my FACE and the smell got stronger. We finally discovered where the smell was coming from. Some sort of stain on the top of the down comforter which was wedged between a sheet and the duvet. Again, at the TOP near my FACE. We immediately called the front desk and they sent a very nice gentleman up to help move our things to a new room, and gave us a few breakfast cards, but the new room was not nearly as nice as our unfortunately smelly first room. Our new room is obviously older, the decor is dated, and the view is not nearly as nice. We feel that for what we're paying and the disgusting experience with the first room (Room 1516), we'd have been given a room at least of equal status. We've stayed at many different hotels, and we thought that the Sheraton would have been at least on par with bigger named chains. We stayed at a Best Western in Lindale, TX and it was SO much nicer, and half the price. We certainly hope the rest of our stay is better. A tip on parking, no need to pay $22 for valet. $5/day across the street.", "title": "What's that smell?", "user": "Kelly B", "date": "December 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 189084234}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I was there for a day.

The location was nice, just a cute trolly ride away from beale street. But the service was mediocre and nothing to write home about. Having been a former employee of the sheraton music city in nashville (where we also stayed) I know what the expectation is as a starwood property and as a sheraton. This wasnt quite it. There was one gentleman in the lobby, a bellman, who was very nice. Overall good, not great. Would maybe stay somewhere else in the future.", "title": "Decent location, average service.
