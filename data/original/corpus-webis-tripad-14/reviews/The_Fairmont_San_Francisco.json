We even had turndown service. The Laurel Court Restaurant was just okay...not horrible, but just okay for the prices that they charge. We had our first mornings breakfast in the restaurant and they had a buffet. They were so busy but the service was once again excellent. The next morning we had room service and it was once again just okay. They charge $3.50 per person extra, plus a 19% service plus something else which I can not remember at this moment.
