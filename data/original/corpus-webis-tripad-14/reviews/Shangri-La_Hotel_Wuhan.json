Room is small as compared to other Shangri-la hotels that I have stayed at. Food in the cafe is excellent, although the environment could be further improved. I dined twice at the Shang Place and both the food and service are good. Price is reasonable for both room and food, but maybe high by local standard as living cost in Wuhan is relatively low as compared to other big cities.

And Wuhan is a 2nd tier city with huge contructions going on as you realize this once your limousine takes you to the hotel which takes almost an hour from the airport to the hotel you see hundreds of skyscrapers climbing up the sky and traffic is heavy all the day. Arriving at the hotel I was amazed as Concierge Lamia standing there to open the door of the car. She is extremly helpful and intelligent. The reason I give an excellent at Shangri-la Wuhan was that my room was not only the Horizon-Club-room but the presidential suite. This suite is huge and very luxury in every sense. This is probably to most prestigous address in Wuhan but it's only a one-bedroom suite by the way. The dinning area, the kitchen, the seperate sitting room, business-centre, the huge bathroom (better said Spa) with seperate bathroom, not to mention the TV-flats and now the best, I have never slept so comfortable in a premium city hotel like here. The bed is as big as you could take your family plus friends to sleep in it at the same time. As the bedroom is far away from any other rooms on the floor, nothing can disturb you from a good sleep. But yes, of course, the view over the city is something different but that's Wuhan. The suite itself is over 200sqm, that's enough to walk around the tables in the evening a bit and to relax yourself. Breakfast was in the Horizon Lounge, also very good. The 1-hour-massage was good as well, not a luxury room but fine related to the age of the hotel.", "title": "Very nice stay at the Shangrila", "user": "Harring10", "date": "October 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143347236}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled solo", "text": "If you need a very relaxing and quiet night before an important meeting day, I highly recommed you try this suite , it's also called \"Yangtze\"-suite or presidential suite.", "title": "comfy bed", "user": "CG0521", "date": "September 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 141367859}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled on business", "text": "I did not pay for this room so I am not sure of the cost, but I thought the room and service was excellent.
