It had a film of greasy stuff on the surface. I also think it was meant to be salt water but they might put chlorine in it because its probably cheaper for them to maintain that way as it seemed like a chlorine and salt smell. Totally disgusting after getting out we all had spots come up on our faces and bodies that lasted for several hours. We didnt realise it was from the spa until the second time we got the rashes after getting in the second time. The shower in the room obviously once had a screen but no longer, you could see where it once was but they now have it gone so water gets all over the tiles where the toilet is. Also when paying to stay somewhere you expect to be able to use the pool, bar etc but we werent allowed to because they closed it off for their own personal use. If we had of been warned we would have stayed elsewhere. The room did have a lovely gas log fire and the bed was comfy and so were the views, the spa was nice but whenn paying for a spa room its not pleasant to have the hours you are allowed to use it be dictated to you. Also pretty sure they use generic shampoo soap etc in dispensers rather than giving guests little bottles where they can see the brand used. I thought resorts had gyms too but this does not have a gym. Also a bbq would have been nice of there was one to use. And they have the worst coffee ever. We are from Melbourne where there is a sophisticated coffee culture, the stuff they passed as coffee was awful so i would recommend taking your own and a plunger and your own cutlery because there is only tea spoons in the rooms, we ordered pasta from the pizza shop one night and we had to eat it with tea spoons because they closed reception at 4pm and we forgot to ask the pizza place to include a plastic fork for us", "title": "They have a spa I reckon you could get pregnant in just from sitting in the water!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "SLR81", "date": "December 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 121404403}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We also booked the Spreets 2 night accommodation package and after reading other reviews on this site we didn't go there with too many expectations. We were given an upstairs room which was clean, quite modern and had a large 2 person spa in the corner looking out the window to the bushland. We didn't use the communal spa or plunge pool as we found the spa in our room more than adequate. The outdoor pool was a little too cold, so we didn't swim in that either. Our breakfast was lovely both mornings. We didn't use the $40 vouchers as these are 'to put toward' a treatment and we still would've had to pay something. (We weren't offered them at check in anyway) We didn't hear the traffic on the main road. The staff were polite and overall I'd say we had a very pleasant stay and it was a good place to base ourselves when exploring Echuca/Moama.

We were able to take advantage of a package deal which in our opinion was good value for money. Our room was a deluxe spa room. Before booking we checked the website, which as it turned out did not make any promises that were not kept. The location is a busy highway, however we were not aware of traffic noise once in the room. It was on the first floor and looked out on tranquil bushland. The in-room double spa was located by a large picture window and made for a very relaxing experience. The fireplace in the room created a cosy atmosphere. I had looked up the trip advisor reviews and was a little concerned at what we might find, however we were not disappointed. The room was in good repair and had good decor. It wasn't fancy but overall well appointed, spacious, clean, modern and comfortable. The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from reception, to restaurant to housekeeping. We took advantage of a number of the day spa treatments. The vichy package was definitely the best - exfoliation and massage while being sprayed with the most relaxing flow of water - that was a new experience for me. My average rating below for service (3) arises from the fact that I attempted to make a booking for the day spa a week beforehand (as requested on the website) - I left a message for someone to call me back to discuss the different types of services. No-one did, and because of my hectic schedule I made the booking only once I arrived. Because they were nearly fully booked, I ended up only getting about half of the treatments I had planned on. The restaurant has a very good set menu deal which gave a good selection of tasty items and good value for money. Overall the trip met our objectives which was to have a relaxing time in a pleasant location, and we would definitely recommend it. We are both seasoned travellers and fairly picky.
