Once again the sink was very chipped, there was a big stain on the carpet and an odd smell in the room. The next day I noticed the sheet had a large hole in it and the blanket had a suspicous stain on it and asked the cleaning lady, who was working a few doors down to please replace it when she was cleaning our room. We then left for the day and returned around 6 pm. We arrived to find the \" Please Make Up Room \" sign lying on the ground outside the door and the room unmade. When I complained I was told the sign said \"Do Not Disturb\" and she had left. As there were very few hotel guests at that time and I had told her my room number and left the \"Please Make Up Room\" sign hanging on the door I was rather perplexed by the situation. What really made matters worse was when Andrew arrived at our door with clean towels and a clean blanket and had the same rude attitude as he had the first night on the phone ( this blanket by the way was full of patched holes). Even my husband noticed his attitude and he is usually very tolerant. All these compaints may seem minor but coupled with rudeness it left us with a very unpleasant stay at this hotel.
