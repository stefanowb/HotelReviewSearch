We paid a little extra for a river view which was nice in the evening. We ordered room service as well which arrived promptly in the morning and it was hot and decent. Tips: Skip valet - parking in garage is easy and cheaper. Hotel online reservation will not guarantee you a king bed - it's king OR 2 doubles.
