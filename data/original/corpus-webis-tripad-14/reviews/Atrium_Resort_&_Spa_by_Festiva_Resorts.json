Check in went OK, but they were working as fast as they could with all the guests breathing down their necks...It has 9 floors, 2 elavators, a nice restaurant and a \"cababna\" area with sandwiches available. We ate at both several times. There is a small convenience store right across the street for booze and stuff. Bigger grocery stores are about 10 minutes away with a vehicle. We were a bit unfortunate with several days of rain during our stay. When it wasn't raining we were out exploring the island beaches, restaurants, snorkeling excursions and Phillipsburg shopping. (Great electronic prices if you need a camera). The restaurants are not cheap, but the service and friendliness makes up for it.

I have rather mixed feelings about this resort. Our 1BR unit was wonderful...roomy, great view, large kitchen and living area, & a GREAT balcony that wrapped around so I had a view of mountains and also the ocean. But the room was the only thing I liked about the Atrium. Well, that and the front desk staff was always helpful. The bellmen were around & helpful on occasion, but I wouldn't count on them. The pool was tiny, shallow and about bathwater temp. The beach was okay at best. The construction going on at a nearby resort had the water murky, and construction materials, tiles, etc. were washed up on the beach. We arrived on a Saturday & on Thursday when I went back to the beach, same tiles were still in same spot. Apparently they haven't thought to hire a beach attendant. Still, St. Maarten is my favorite Caribbean island, & I'm particularly fond of the Simpson Bay area.

Great time to go as it is the start of the off season. Stores, restaurants and beaches had no crowds. A few beaches we went to had less then 15 people on them. The Atrium was a great place to stay. We had a large bedroom with sliding glass door that went out onto a balcony, large tv, ceiling A/C, fan, and lots of closet space. Adequate bathroom. Big kitchen for cooking a few meals in to save money or if we didn't feel like going out. Pull out sleeper couch, ceiling fan, A/C, tv in the living room area with a table and 4 chairs. The balcony off the living room area was very large and had views of both Simpson Bay and Simpson Bay lagoon and surrounding hills. People are ripping the decor apart on these reviews... it was adequate (not an eye sore). Plus they are aparently upgrading the decor soon. There was two small pools to swim in but we preferred the beautiful, calm bay (Simpson Bay). The staff at the front desk were helpful. There was a security gaurd on duty at night in the lobby. The Buccanear Bar is right on the beach outside the hotel. Hot dogs, hamburgers, Chicken and Pizza plus cheap beer. They also have a server that brings you drinks on the beach! You have to rent a car here. We took the \"bus\" into Phillipsburg one day and paid only $1 per person but we preferred having our own car. We rented a Kia Rio from the Dollar Rental Car at the front desk for a day and the thing had no radio and most noteably... no balls. It bottomed out on most speed bumps and the petal was to the metal going up hills and we were by no means flying. We rented a Rav 4 the rest of the week and were fine climbing the hills and much more comfortable going over the hundreds (possible slight exaggeration) of speed bumps on the island. Dining on the French side was good but over priced $6 for a liter of water, $100 total without appetizer. Shopping was all about jewelery and diamonds and expensive French boutiques. The currency on the Dutch side is the dollar or there's a local currency and the Euro on the French side. Simpson Bay was a great, centrally located place to stay on the island. The beach never had more than 10 people on it. Free chairs and umbrellas on the beach. We had a great time at the Atrium.

The staff is very attentive, the rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed (plasma tv, full kitchen, etc.). The decor was fine, slightly outdated (they apparently are getting ready to redo the units) the grounds were clean, attractive and tropical. We had stayed here a couple of years ago and you could see that they keep improving the resort. They do not pressure you at all to buy a timeshare. They had a very nice party on Monday- Food, drinks, live music and several drawings for free gifts-everyone had a good time. The Buccaneer Beach Bar is right there and a fun place to meet people staying at the resort (the food there is really good also, the Pirate Pizza was amazing). The pool area while small was really nice. You could walk to eat Z-Best for breakfast, Saratoga, Jimbo's, Banana's, Pineapple Pete's... all good, all in walking distance. You have to drive to get to the good beaches regardless of where you are staying, so the beach at the resort wasn't an issue - it was clean and there if you wanted it. Walking distance to the marina, day trip to St. Bart's and Snorkeling at Creole Rock both great. We had a wonderful stay at the Atrium, it was quiet and peaceful and perfect for adults who wanted to relax without their children. They allowed us to check in early and provided a two bedroom hospitality suite for our late departure.

Second we look for a quiet and an uncrowded beach. The Atrium was full and yet it never felt crowded. The beach was awesome and never a rush in the morning for a palapa. There were about 20 palapa's on the beach. The beaches are great on St Martin and the Atriums was nice and peaceful.

The smallest island in the world to be shared by two sovereign powers (The Netherlands and France), St. Maarten provides a winning blend of Caribbean hospitality and European sophistication. Rolling hillsides, blue lagoons and breathtaking views are just a few reasons why so many visitors return every year to this island. With its half mile of natural beach and an array of nearby water sports, the Atrium is practically paradise. This quiet, beachfront resort overlooks the calm Caribbean Sea and is minutes from the glamorous nightlife and duty-free shopping of both the Dutch and French sides of the island.Adjoining the resort's pool area is a Spanish tapas bar, Picante. In addition to light and delicious fare, Picante also features a jazz club. If tranquility, luxury and a full-service staff are what you want, the Atrium is the place for you."}
