The rooms are all standard Holiday Inn rooms. Not huge, but about the right size for a short stay. Rooms are always clean. Exercise area small, pool small. Breakfast is expensive so if you decide to go for it, eat alot because it will cost you if you eat a piece of toast or if you eat a 5-course meal. I have had a few instances of staff being rude. Every staff person I have ever spoken to at the Holiday Inn spoke English, and spoke it well. If you can get a room with a view, it is outstanding. It can be a bit out of the way, but the bus stop is only a 5 minute walk away and it is a short trip to the Hauptbahnhof for 1.50 Euros. There is a lovely Elb Park right next door that allows for a nice walk or run. They used to rent out a bicycle but I didn't see it the last time I stayed. A new golf driving range was built just down the street and it promoted by the hotel.
