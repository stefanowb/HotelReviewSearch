I stay there from 4 to 10 April and i have to fight for my breakfast..... I have to explain this, so... the bread was always to little for all the roomers and you have to wait to refill the hamper. I have to face the same problem with water, cheese, ham but the problem was fixed (not at all) after a conversation i had with the reception. These was the bad things all the others was good enough for me. The staff was friendly and ready to help, the hotel was clean, with a modern decoration and the distance from the center was only a 5-7 minutes walk.

It was very clean, the staff very helpful, offered free use of a computer with internet access, and had particularly nice bathrooms. The major downside in my opinion would be the location. It is a fair walk (15 minutes down a regular city street) to the main attractions of the city. My fiancee and I are young and walked every where in Italy, but found this walk more rather annoying. Unlike Rome or Venice there was nothing to see walking to and from the hotel. After a full day of touring we typically would return back to the room before dinner. Who wants to walk another 15-20 min at night through a non spectacular part of the city just o reach a restaurant?
