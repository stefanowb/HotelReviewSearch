For that price, this hotel was a very good deal. It included a free hot breakfast, which wasn't high quality, but was more than adequate. The hotel has a small pool, which I didn't use, and a small fitness center that includes a couple of tread mills and elliptical machines, as well as a universal weight system. It is located about a mile away from the Arundel Mills Mall, where plenty of shopping and dining is available. Tandem to the Holiday Inn is a Denny's Restaurant, which I did not dare try, since I don't like the food Denny's carries. The room was adequate and included free WiFi, cable TV, a mini-fridge, and a small microwave. However, the room had a musty, smokey smell to it. That musty scent was present throughout the hotel. The hotel furnishings, wall paper, etc all seemed a bit old and definitely looked used. The hotel was more than adequate for me, and as I mentioned, was well worth the price for the weekly rate of ~$80/night. However, when I asked about the rate for staying 2 nights in July, they quoted me around $140/night, which is approximately the price of a room at the somewhat newly constructed Residence Inn or Springfield Inn in Hanover. I opted to stay elsewhere in July since I wasn't willing to pay $140/night for an older Holiday Inn.", "user": "ACW30", "date": "August 4, 2011", "id": 116264236}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Required a hotel close to the airport without time to investigate choices; they had rooms when we called so we booked three rooms for our business travel.
