Felt more like private apartments than a hotel really as the rooms were around a little courtyard at the back just off the main promenade and each had their own doorway and outside area. Perfect place to spent my time of Brac during my solo backpacking tour of Croatia. Breakfast buffet was standard and good value, and the hotel staff were fantastic - would go out there way to make sure everything was great for you. They even arranged the pick up of my catamaran ticket to Split so that i didn't need to make the trip along the promenade into Bol to get it when I could be sunbathing on the beach! :) Brilliant. The girl on reception was super friendly and really really helpful - I arrived really early in the morning but they were more than eager to get me checked in and settled into my room as quickly as possible. I had dinner on the promenade here one night - just a pizza but it was great too. Really couldn't fault this place. Best location out there for Zlatni Rat beach and a lovely stroll along the promenade (about 15mins walk) to get into Bol for the evenings. I would go back here in an instant!

The first room we were in did not look like any of the pictures on booking.com (we were a corner unit in the gardens) but it was fine. However the shower would flood and there was no hot water. We complained about the hot water and were told it was due to use at peak times (insert eye roll since I used the shower at multiple different times including 2am). We checked with other units and none of them had hot water either. A few absurd reasons later and they finally admitted the hot water tank servicing the garden rooms was broken and after my husband complained numerous times they finally moved us to a sea view room (serviced by different tanks so no more issues with hot water and I could finally clean myself). Didn't appreciate the excuses from front-desk staff, but they were fine other than that. And as others have said the sea view rooms have no sea views, but they are a little more spacious and do look like the pictures on booking.com (although we did catch a glimpse of a couple rooms on the garden side and their's matched the website, so apparently just our room was a bit more plain).Oh - our fridge in the first room also didn't work, they tried to fix and couldn't, so they replaced it with this huge, loud, ugly fridge which we unplugged since the noise kept us up at night.", "title": "Good location for beach, nice rooms, but difficult to describe this place", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Weekender32", "date": "August 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137211396}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Location, but...", "text": "Overall: The hot water issues, fridge problem, and unhelpful service regarding the hot water left a sour taste in my mouth about this place.
