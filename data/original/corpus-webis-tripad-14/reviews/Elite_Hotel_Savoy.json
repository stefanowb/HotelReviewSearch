What I liked best was the fresh fruit. It still had the rind on the watermelon and pineapple so you knew it did not come from a can. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was nicely outfitted. The room was not a bad size. And surprise, surprise you were not limited to watching CNN or BBC world in the evening after a long day of sightseeing. There are a number of channels that are in English subtitled in Swedish. Most all sights are within easy walking distance of the hotel.
