But I can safely say that after visiting there, it was out of all the places I stayed in the 2 week period(4-5 different Sarova hotels and the White Sands), by far my favorite!! Ok sure, it's not a Sarova hotel, but the experience of being so far out in the middle of the green forrest just above a watering hole is not something your going to see anywhere else! The rooms are not that small, the beds are comfy, and there's hot water. The whole point of being there is to see the wildlife, not be in your rooms the whole time. You'll be outside or in other viewing rooms watching these animals practically walk right past you. The people are SO nice and welcoming. They will sit and tell you some pretty amazing stories too. I loved everything about The Ark, and I wish I could have stayed there longer. If you want to experience the wild, then I definitely suggest this. It's something you can only experience in Kenya.
