If you want a good meal for the price, the lobby restaurant by the Gift Shop served excellent food with knowledgable staff and English speaking, which helped for our questions.

I will however say that Thompson rated this as 4T's which is a bit much. It's an average 3* hotel at best. We ate out every night so dinner wasn't an issue. They tried to deny us breakfast on our second morning but apologised straight away when they realised they were wrong. We never left a tip for the room cleaners as the only thing they did was make our bed (which we could have done). They didn't even empty our glasses of water from our bedside for the 4 nights we were there, or put into the bin any empty shampoo packets mistakenly left in the bathroom. We were on the 3rd floor and the first night was very noisy in the corridor. The walls are very thin and i'm pleased i took earplugs. That said, the staff were helpful when asked anything and they didn't charge us for a phone call when i realised i'd booked our return taxi for the wrong time to the airport. The spa facilities are fine and the pool was ample seeing as i didn't intend to spend too long in the hotel. it really was for us just a base for putting our heads down. that said i don't do hostels so wouldn't have wanted anything run down. We used Airport Transfers Budapest (ATB) who were brilliant and not too expensive. Driver apologised for being late when in fact we'd touched down early. They then turned up two hours early at our urgent request when i'd booked the wrong departure time. Couldn't recommend them enough. Be careful when using the trams. We didn't know how to validate our tickets and tried watching the locals but no-one seemed to do theirs. When the ticket inspectors got on, we were booted off the tram for fare dodging and fined \u00a320 each (12,000HUF in total). Not really fair on a tourist who intentionally purchased a ticket but just didn't know how to validate it. That was our only bad point. Recommend you learn some basic words. Thank You got us big smiles where ever we went. Recommend the Orange Hop On Hop Off bus tour - 5,000HUF gets you a 24hr bus pass, 2 boat trips valid for a year, 1 beer, and 1 Goulash. 1 boat trip alone was worth 2,100 HUF's. overall a good city to do a four day visit to.", "title": "cheap, local, basic", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "saminguy", "date": "April 13, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 103897484}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "I came to the Flemenco to accompany my husband on a business trip. I had read the reviews so didn't have huge expectations. However it's pretty good at what it does. An easy tram ride to the centre, though it's not that far to walk, made for easy sightseeing. The hotel is a little stale, rather dated, but mostly OK so if being seen in the newest and latest isn't important to you then you'll be fine. Everything works, beds are fine, there's plenty water from the shower, the breakfast is perfectly acceptable. We were brought extra pillows without hesitation. My main complaint was only having a single dispenser of liquid soap as the 'supplied' toiletries. These days, when we all fly hand luggage, it's nice to have some little bottles of shampoo and body lotion etc in the room.. but my kind husband procured some little bottles of shampoo from a cleaner or reception or someone, so they are available - just ask. I didn't hear a single whinge about the conference facilities from my husband, so I guess all was good there. Certainly the 'conference' food was of a good standard. So all in all, better than I had expected and nothing really to complain about. (A bigger pool would be good, but hey..).
