Last week's coastal journey did not allow that, but we enjoyed a lovely drink at sunset in exquisite restaurant setting. Serendipitously drove up to visit property, and wonderful security man suggested we drive in and haveva bite at the bar. Only downside: could not pull myself away and ended up driving to Cambria in the dark, missing the scenery and clutching the wheel!

This is a hotel that perches on the tip pf Big Sur, with mind-blowing beauty. They cuple that with the best designed accommodations I have ever seen, and top it off with top-drawer, friendly and welcoming taff. You leave your car in a lot near reception and they drive you and your luggage to your room - all of which are individual sructures sprinkled throughout the riddgeline overlooking the Pacific. Rooms have individual hot tubs and working fireplaces that they keep stocked with wood; the contents of the mini-bar are yours to have, use, and take with you, all gratis. Breakfast buffet included in room price and both it and dinner are served in the centrally located and beautiful Sierra Mar multi level restaurant with every table having a magnificent view of the Pacific several hundred feet below. Wine list is a bit small and seems to favor (of course) California, but the wine steward is helpful. Look outside as you wander the grounds - deer, rabbits and even a wild turkey or two wander the area - and look at you like an outsider - which you are! Be sure to make it at least a two night stay, so as to have a full day to relax in natural beauty and peace.
