After a long drive up the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco, we were looking for a peaceful, relaxing setting. We checked in and the room, although definitely dated, offered everything we needed for the night and was exceptionally clean. I immediately opened the sliding glass doors that opened up to the beach and ventured out to check out the surf. Within 5 minutes I met some folks who recommended the restaurant next door and invited us to join them later that evening as they were planning to build a fire on the beach. After a very nice meal, we did indeed join them and had a wonderful conversation in a perfectly idyllic setting. There aren't too many places that still allow you to build fires on the beach. We retired to our room and felt perfectly safe leaving the sliding door open so that we could enjoy the sound of the surf.", "user": "ocsurvivor", "date": "June 23, 2008", "id": 17149357}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great views and location, not so great comfort", "text": "Pros: friendly, helpful staff; great location right on the beach; porch facing the beach", "user": "peterbaer", "date": "June 10, 2008", "id": 16810692}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing beach front room!", "text": "Cons: Small rooms; uncomfortable pillows", "user": "sarabeara", "date": "May 6, 2008", "id": 15693308}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Best in Crescent City", "text": "Neutral: Restaurant next door is OK but a bit overpriced for what you get (the service is top-notch however)", "user": "MauiRegular", "date": "April 10, 2008", "id": 14926961}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful spot on the ocean", "text": "We stayed here on our trip through the redwoods. The kids loved this place because the beach is right outside the sliding glass door. The beach is large and flat so the kids had a blast. There really is no breakfast. The room was fairly small and old but very clean. The bed was very firm and I had a hard time sleeping but I'd stay there again for the location! The drains also didn't seem to keep up. 101 is right outside the front door. The view was incredible. I'm going to include some pictures. Also, the Chart room which is on Anchor way (the first left going north) has great food with a wonderful view of the marina and seals and sea lions. We had breakfast and dinner there.

We could clearly hear snoring through the paper thin walls over our portable Sound Machine that we bring just to drown out such noises (No success this time) .The bathroom in this 40-50 year old establishment was miniscule ... about the size of a small broom closet. There was a small Screened window in the bathroom (About shoulder High) that will allow you to Meet and greet your neighbors as they walk by! The only posiitve during the stay was the View ... as long as the kids from the next room weren't playing on the *Communal* deck that runs the length of all of the Ocean facing rooms... meaning that if we left the curtains open, we had kids and adults from other rooms, sitting in front of our sliding glass door, smoking, and looking into our room...
