The food at breakfast was very average, and they ran out of some things every morning. There was always a massive queue to get a table at breakfast, and there were endless screaming kids about. The room was very dated, and needed to be revamped. The bathroom was small and a bit grubby, and the shower didn't have a lot of pressure. The sheets didn't fit the bed properly and every night they came off the sides of the bed so we ended up partially sleeping directly on the mattress. The bedding also felt very cheap, with what felt like nylon sheets. The lift was slow. The windows in our room were so dirty, you couldn't see out for the smears all over them.", "title": "Homewood made son's Wedding weekend smooth and stress free", "user": "Nina_Cuckoo", "date": "August 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 39275860}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "If you are looing for a cheap place to stay in the middle of things, this is the place.

My husband and I were traveling with our 10 month-old son and 3 year-old son. From the moment of our arrival our experience was completely positive. The valets were very helpful with unloading the kids and luggage from the car. The staff at the front desk was fantastic. They had a crib delivered to our room within 20 minutes of our arrival. The complimentary dinner the first night was great. After traveling all afternoon, it was nice that we didn't have to try and make arrangments for dinner. The staff in \"the lodge\" where dinner and breakfast were served was very friendly and attentive, as well. It was nice that they had carry-out containers available to take dinner and breakfast back to the room if you don't want to eat in the dining room. Throughout our stay, all of the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was great. It was like having an apartment, and gave us plenty of room for the kids to spread out with their toys and play. It was nice to have the kitchen, especially for preparing bottles, and for having dinner in the room which was generally carry-out from area restaurants. The hotel has a room service arrangement with P.F. Chang's, and is within walking distance of a lot of nice restaurants. Great location for walking to area attractions - the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier. We are already planning to retun next summer, and will recommend the Homewood Suites to our family and friends.", "user": "Suemarie99", "date": "August 20, 2009", "id": 38236586}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Perfect location, clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay.
