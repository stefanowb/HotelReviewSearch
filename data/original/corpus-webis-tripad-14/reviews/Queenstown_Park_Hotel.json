The rooms are modern, spacious and well-equipped. The breakfast is delicious with a wide-ranging choice. The whole team of staff, managed by John and Donna, are extremely helpful, friendly and well-informed with the ability to provide a wealth of information about the local area and activities (of which there are many). The location, at the foot of the mountains, is ideal with just a short walk into the centre of town. This is everything a boutique hotel should be so it's difficult to pick an outstanding feature but if pushed it's the early evening happy hour where complimentary wine and canapes are served each day providing the opportunity to mingle with other guests.
