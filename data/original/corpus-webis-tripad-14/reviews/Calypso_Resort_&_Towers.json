The Calypos has a beach bar that makes it handy to grab a cold drink while at the beach. Parking at the Calypso is across the street and there is a covered walkway that joins it.

One from a private owner and one from a property rental company. Both Condo's were ok, Nothing special but nice. I'd say average. Both the private owner and the rental company were nice. Both Condos had issues upon arrival but were handled properly and promptly.1st the good.The location is wonderful. The Calypso is within easy walking distance to pier park. This is really the only great thing about it. Now the bad. Poor design of the corridor where you have to go to get to the elevators. They are too narrow and 2 people with luggage carts can't pass. Not enough elevators. Only 3 per tower, they need at least 4. Who wants to spend their entire vacation waiting on elevators? NO HOT TUB. This was a biggie for my wife who enjoys the hot tub at night. Poor pool design. The pools are too narrow. I saved the worst for last. They have 2 rows of rental beach chairs and umbrellas at the beach. They stretch almost the entire length of the property. You can't set up you own umbrella or tent in front of them. This leaves you a long way back from the water with no view of the ocean and very little breeze. We set our tent one day on one end near the beach. The wave runner rental people told us we had to move because they rent 20 ft. We were clearly outside their 20ft cones, they were claiming more like 40 ft. We augured with them and they let us stay. We left the frame to our tent overnight. The next morning it was gone. We found it had been moved about 20 feet away. Obviously the wave runner people had moved it. Again our location was clearly not in their space. With the 2 rows of rental chairs stretching across almost the entire beachfront and the wave runner rental you can't set your own tent or umbrella near the water. It seems the Calypso cares more about the all mighty dollar than it does about it's guest. We stayed at the Emerald beach by Wyndam twice last year. It's 3/4 of a mile further from the pier park but a lot better and a little less expensive .

May 2012. Customer service at the front desk and at the beach chairs was unsatisfactory. The showers were all moldy. Dirty, pet stained carpet to the point I was uncomfortable placing the baby on the carpet. The armoire in a child\u2019s bedroom is not bolted together so there is a high possibility that if bumped or pulled on, it could fall on the child. TV in one bedroom was broken--no help to fix. Beach chairs have to be reserved each day even though after a big tip on the first day, the guy told us we could have the same chairs. The next day, our belongings, which were bagged up and placed in between the chairs, were out of the bags and thrown all over the beach (30 ft linear distance). The chair guy admitted doing it. The front desk said they had no oversight with the chair people since it was contracted out (easy way to fix that is to cancel the contract and get better people). The corridors to the rooms were so narrow that a cart or baby stroller took up the entire space and no one could pass in either direction. There is no wifi in the condos and only one short cord so multiple people cannot be online at one time. We requested a blanket for the fold out sofa-bed and it took three days of phone calls and visits to the front desk to receive it. There were not enough chairs at the pool. When the \u201ccourtesy patrol\u201d was asked to clear chairs that had towels but no people, they would not. When I complained and said that the chair situation was enough to make us not return, his replay was \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d The Calypso is not a \u201cvalue\u201d type condo.
