Nice, super clean room - seemed like it was brand new! The bottled water and the trail mix they left for me was a nice surprise since i didn't check in until after 10:30 pm. Convenient location to the airport and a shuttle is provided from 5AM to 11 PM which saved on cab fare if not renting a car. Hotel seemed to be in more of a residential area with the closest restaurants a little distance away (the hotel does offer a shuttle to Easton Town Centre if reserved in advance).

Breakfast options were decent for a free breakfast - all prepackaged (cereals, juices, danishes, fruit and cereal bars) but perfect to take along or take back to your room. Room was $130 for a 2bd suite. The beds and furnishings were all decent and the beds were very comfortable with what seemed to be very clean linens and a nice assortment of pillows and extras.

It was a little tight for three people, but my bridesmaid & I shared the queen, and my sister slept on the pull-out, so we survived. You can book a larger room, but Priceline just gives you what it does.
