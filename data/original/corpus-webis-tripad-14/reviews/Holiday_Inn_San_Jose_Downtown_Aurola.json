However, I am probably the only person in a week or so of tour guests that was interested in using the swimming pool. The pool was closed because they were redoing the tile and fixing other things. The first night we were there we could and did use the hot tub which is in the same nicely decorated area. They also have a ping pong table in the pool area. The second night entrance was not allowed in the pool room because they were painting. This was very disappointing to me as it was the middle of January and the pool and hot tub were high on my list of things to do for my \"winter break\". Why they would do this when the hotel was full of tourists I don't know. We also had no hot water for our shower for two days.
