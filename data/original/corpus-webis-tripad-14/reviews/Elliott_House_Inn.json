Our room was average-sized and clean, with a comfy bed, tv, and small (but modern) bathroom. It definitely served its purpose. Be aware, however, that the Inn was originally constructed in the 1860s and may shows its age in some spots (like all historic and old buildings will). The Inn underwent renovations in 2011 and is welcoming enough, but do not expect lavish accommodations- they have a small, simple courtyard with a hot tub where basic cheeses and bottles of wine are set out every afternoon- a nice touch but by no means extravagant. The continental breakfast is simple but that's to be expected with continental breakfasts. It was perfect to kickstart our day! Also be aware that parking is not included in the price for the hotel- it is available in a public garage across the street (literally like 10 steps from the Inn entrance) and carries a cost of $20/day. In my opinion the location and price advantage make this one of the best options in Charleston. I booked the Elliot on a pair of weekdays for a quick getaway with my honey and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It offered a homey environment while providing for an unbeatable location. If you're looking for lavish accommodations and want to be pampered, look elsewhere (and prepare to pay a very steep price- Charleston lodging in the downtown district is very expensive). If you're looking for a nice, quality bed-and-breakfast that will suit your lodging needs and provide awesome access to the town, the Elliot is for you. (One final note: I've heard some complain that the Elliot doesn't provide enough luxury for it high price tag. While it's true that the Inn carries a high price compared to most hotels nationally, Charleston lodging in this area is very expensive. The well-kept, clean environment coupled with amazing location definitely warrant the higher rates). My lovebug and I thoroughly enjoyed our time in Charleston and owe much of that to the staff at \"E-House\", as a much wittier reviewer coined the Inn in a previous post.", "title": "Great location, way overpriced, less than mediocre room, unfriendly staff.", "user": "JandKD", "date": "March 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155116391}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Could have been better", "text": "Beautiful courtyard, flower boxes.

It's just that there was constant traffic morning noon and night so there was no privacy with the shades open. I also hate to report that I stepped on a cockroach in the room.
