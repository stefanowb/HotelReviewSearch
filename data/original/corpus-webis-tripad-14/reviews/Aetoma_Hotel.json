I recently had the great pleasure to stay at the Aetoma Hotel. In the first place, the location is central and convenient, easy walking to charming restaurants, lovely shops and ocean swimming. Visually captivating from the exterior, one is struck by the sheer charm of the place. It was a home. It remains a home. You feel at home. What other reviewers have written over and over is true. The service is sincere and heartfelt. It shows. An example. I stupidly blundered and irretrievably locked the safe, requiring help to reopen it. Within minutes of notice, Akis (son of the proprietor), was in my room, fixing it and blaming himself and his father for choosing this model of safe. Now. Ask yourself this question: how often in your experience have you had a seller, a landlord, a service provider immediately accept responsibility for a problem? How often have you had that experience when the fault was likely *yours*? In my experience this is rare just like the people who own and run this hotel. How charming our world would be with more like them. I feel gratitude and loyalty. As for the details, dimensions, food and other wonderful aspects of the hotel, these are all well reviewed and accurate in the many excellent and highly favorable reviews herein. For my part, I can't wait to return. I have my happy memories which show with my smile whenever someone asks me about Nafplion, \"Nafplion, ah yes...\" Thank you Pan, Akis and team.
