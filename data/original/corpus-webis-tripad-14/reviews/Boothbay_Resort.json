The cottage was cute and had enough room, but paint was peeling everywhere and the furniture seem to come from a collage dorm. Supposedly it has wifi, but I never picked up a signal and when we asked about it we were treated rudely as if we were stupid. House keeping seemed to be non-existent. The whole place is on gravel, so you have to where sandals to the pool which was falling apart as well as the Jacuzzi which had green water and broken jets. There were some form of RED ANTS everywhere and I was bitten on the neck and had to take Benadryl and ice it for 3 hours to reduce the swelling. I brought it to the owners attention that these were all over the patio in front of the cottage and was told we have ants here in ME and they refused to do anything about it. Every time we engaged the staff at this place we were treated rudely and dismissed as pests. I would not stay here again if it were free.

The cottage was modern, updated, and very clean. I liked the faux wood floors versus carpet \u2013 you never know what\u2019s been on those carpets at the chain motels. There were good quality bed linens and towels, not the cheapo thin towels and sheets that you can see through. We had all the cooking utensils and plates needed. The bedrooms were a little snug but we were able to fit our travel crib in a corner. You could not tell that our cottage was a dog friendly as it was in good condition, smelled clean, and no hair from previous canine guest. Only downsides were...it got a little warm and muggy over the 4th \u2013 while there was a good AC in the living area, the bedrooms got warm and stuffy.
