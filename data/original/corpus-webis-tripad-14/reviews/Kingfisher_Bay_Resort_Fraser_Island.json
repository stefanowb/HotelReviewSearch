NO AIR-CON, but had everything you need.Deffinately take food, lots of it bcos it will cost you as a family about $150plus per day and that's ordering the cheapest. Nothing to do for kids except for swim bcos everything else costs alot of $$$$. Food in restaurants was very ordinary. Rooms are not serviced and we paid $360 per night!!!!You have to pay to hire snorkels, canoes, fishing rods(which are poor quality and in our circumstance-BROKEN)Most of the previous people who stayed in our villa had commented badly also. We hired a 4 wheel drive so we could actually do something and it cost $260 plus $40 insurance plus $35 permit plus $25 feul only to visit 3 lakes(which were beautiful) but it takes you forever to get to them, very rough drive and wake up next day all sore!We stayed 5nights and wish we stayed home and saved $2500+. Don't go to the coffee shop there, we waited 45mins for 3 toasted sandwiches!!!!!!!!!and no one else was in the shop.

We did not regret staying here. The ferry over from Hervey Bay was about 45 minutes. The first thing we noticed upon our arrival was the sounds of all the birds and wildlife. Amazing! The resort is very large. There are two really nice restaurants. Make sure you book your meals when you arrive. Because, the complex is so large our villa was quite a walk down to the main building, so if you are elderly or have small children, make sure you request a room close to the main building. We loved the walk. A little creepy at night with all the night sounds of the wildlife. The villa was really nice and had a well equipped, good sized kitchen. We rented a 4x4 for the second day and took a trip to Mackenzie Lake and drove on the beach. This is a must to do! My husband really enjoyed this part of our stay. Three days is not enough. I would recommend atleast five days and book a two day 4x4. They have three pools and they are all beautiful!

Dont forget you may only average 10kilometer per hour on inland tracks from kingfisher so it is possible to spend say 7hrs driving in an 8hr day, It is much much better value to rent a huge modern 4 bedroom home from $700-$1100 per week fully equipped and better located, share this between 2 couples very cheap.

No bugs reported, the sliding doors worked great, and as we sat outside overlooking a small pond, we enjoyed the entertainment from flocks of lorikeets, and numerous water birds. Perhaps because we were there mid-week, there were not many people, the pool was uncrowded, and Seabelle's food was reasonable, although the service was slow.
