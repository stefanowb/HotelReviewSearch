With this deal, I think you would be hard pressed to beat this hotel. Our room was quiet, ample and clean. They also offered free internet which was a plus. My complaints about this hotel are fairly minor. It is overdesigned; a little too boutique-y, if you will. Others have complained about the breakfast situation. It is a bit of a cattle call and we did end up sharing a table with some folks. Not a big deal to me but I don't think this is a rare happening. They also go in for the aromatherapy here so there is a distinct smell to all the public areas of this place including the restaurant. It's not a bad smell but it's a smell.
