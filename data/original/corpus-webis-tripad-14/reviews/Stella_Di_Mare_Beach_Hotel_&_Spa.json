Having read Trip Advisor reviews carefully we chose the Stella Di Mare and selected a superior de Luxe room and what a brilliant choice it turned out to be. during 50 years of marriage we have stayed at countless hotels in many countries and we rate this hotel the best ever! From the moment we arrived with the complimentary transfer, to the fastest check in ever where we were presented with refreshing drinks and towels,until the moment we departed, we were thoroughly pampered. This hotel is beautifully situated on the beach with fabulous views across the bay. It has an extensive beach area,wonderful pools and restaurants and immaculate lawns and gardens. In fact the whole hotel is immaculate. Our Egyptian themed room had every creature comfort and the bed was the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. Best of all though is the friendliness and care of the staff. The Egyptian people are naturally hospitable and welcoming but they all go that extra mile at this hotel. We enjoyed a wonderful beachside 'romantic dinner' with soft music.flowers and all the trimmings on our anniversary and a complimentary chocolate cake on my birthday and anniversary' The experience on the beach is wonderful, plenty of sunbeds and fresh towels every day, regular cool water and fruit and even your sunglasses cleaned every day. Little things but certainly with our beach attendant Ehab done with a smile and a chat for everyone.and it makes everyone feel like a special guest. We stayed on a B & B basis and only had meals other than breakfast twice in the evening and lunch at the beach bar these were good. We have had a better choice of breakfasts in other hotels but they are adequate. There is a quiet piano bar and a good disco and of course lots of entertainment in Sharm itself. The hotel is a little way out of Sharm el Sheikh centre, but the complimentary shuttle bus is easy and efficient and taxis are cheap. As you can gather we loved this hotel and can't wait to return.
