I stayed 2 nights here. Some rooms are outside and some of the are indoors. I had a room inside, next to a covered breezeway. Laundry services were a little high priced, and they only had a 2 washers and 2 dryers. The pop machine downstairs in their breezeway didnt accept dollars, only quarters. The pool is enclosed by all of the outside rooms. My favorite part of staying here was the beautiful mountains that were pictured anywhere you looked. You walk out side of the front lobby and you can see a huge beautiful mountain. The hotel is conveniently located near 3-4 gas stations, the highway and the town of Hollins. It was easy to find what I needed, when I needed it. I think it is actually about 3-5 miles away from the airport, I never heard any airport traffic noise while I was there. Breakfast was comprised of items that were meant for a sweet tooth, which some do not like.. but I enjoyed. Sugary cereals, and powdered donuts for me the whole time I was there. There is also a bar/restaurant that is located on the premises. Even on a Saturday night it was not loud or noisy at all. My room was right down the hall from it. It was just an added convenience. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again. Staff was very friendly, and did not have a single problem.", "title": "Beautiful and Convenient!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Jayme P", "date": "August 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 173847102}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I have stay here many times before and I have always good experience at this hotel.

The sink is separate from the bath tub and toilet which helped when trying to get going in the morning. The shower nozzel is set at about 5 ft high, so I had to bend down to wash my hair.
