Upon arrival the temperature in our room was approx. 84 degrees (27 Celsius), but upon adjusting the thermostat to cool the room we discovered it wasn't putting out any cool air. We called the front desk and they promptly sent someone up to investigate. When the hotel employee could not get the a/c to work we were moved to another room. This room was older and not quite as nice, but hey\u2026.if we were cool we really didn't care that much. Once again we tried to bring down the temperature in the room, but since the thermostat controls in this older room were all in Chinese we had to call for help again. Again, the employee could not get cool air to start generating. Long story short, we finally were told that there was a city ordinance stating that the temperature was not hot enough outside to turn on the a/c to the rooms! Since we found this to be the case in almost every hotel we stayed in during our visit to China I'm not sure if the Jianguo Garden Hotel is 100% fully to blame. With that said, we do find fault in that the hotel advertises that the rooms are air conditioned without any disclaimer that this only applies to certain months of the year. In addition, no other hotel claimed it was a city ordinance (one claimed it was to conserve energy) and our English speaking guide had never heard of such and ordinance. We were disappointed that they could not tell us up front the reason the A/C was not on rather than go through the trouble of moving us to another room. We think the reason we were moved to a different room was to give us a room where the window opened \u2013 the fact that it only opened a few inches and let in the Beijing pollution and the sounds of construction next door that went on all night long really outweighed any cooling benefits. Didn't think to ask for an electric fan, but it would have helped tremendously as we discovered in the other hotels we stayed in.", "title": "Great....if air conditioning isn't high on your priority list", "user": "WHERESWAUGH", "date": "May 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 15758648, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Good location - close to Forbidden City", "disliked": "\u2014 Rooms not air conditioned"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled on business", "text": "One last thing to note - The breakfast buffet was quite good, however we thought it to be a little pricey since it was not included in the cost of our room.", "title": "My bed had fleas", "user": "Coltbridge", "date": "March 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 14491765, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Fleas in the bedding"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with family", "text": "My bed had fleas.
