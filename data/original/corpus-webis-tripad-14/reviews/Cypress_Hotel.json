I was very aprehensive as have mainly stayed in down town - Sheraton or Marriot hotels in China. This was a welcome surprise with deluxe rooms giving a large queen bed, sitting area, desk, dressing area and bathroom. The staff understood basic English and were very helpful; I would not recommend the European food (not good!) but dine in the Jasmine restaurant - great Chinese food at fair prices.", "title": "Deluxe rooms offer comfort and space in Shanghai", "user": "PandEKew", "date": "September 24, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 44143192}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Only if you're stuck", "text": "OK hotel in a middle class suburb of Shanghai...", "user": "jlg84", "date": "February 26, 2008", "id": 13850459}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007", "text": "My company often puts us up at this hotel, since it's near the airport and our office, but those are really the only two advantages of the place.
