They are located on a quiet street in Palermo which is within walking distance to shops, restaurants, nightlife and the subway but not too close to be loud all the time. The staff is very attentive and provide a lot of information on the city and attractions. Local calls are free as well as internet (only one computer in the hotel). The rooms are small but well maintained and have air-conditioning. It is important to confirm your reservation in advance as they lost ours and we had to do quite a bit of reshuffling. They have an outdoor patio space and a sun-deck, which are ideal to sharing a bottle of Malbec.", "title": "Cute B&B in great neighborhood on quiet street", "user": "lolomojo", "date": "January 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 6575221, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very accommodating, walk to nightlife, quiet", "disliked": "\u2014 Small rooms"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We spent two nights in Solar Soler B&B, last december.This B&B is a marvellous place and we absolutely loved it.The location in Palermo Hollywood is perfect, very close to metro, restaurants and shops, in a quiet street.
