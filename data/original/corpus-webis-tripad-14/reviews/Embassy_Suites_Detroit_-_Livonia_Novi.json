I found that they weren't anymore expensive (and in some cases were less expensive) than what you will find on travelocity, expedia or similar sites. Also re check the rates before you go. We booked the room for 129.00/night but I noticed that a week before we were scheduled to arrive the hotel had dropped their rates to 99.00/night. The hotel staff were very helpful and I had no problems getting the lower rate.
