I never ever wrote a hotel review in my life although me and my husband have travelled a lot and usually stay in 4 and 5 star hotels around the world. But after our trip to the New Otani I decided I had to. I chose the hotel because of a recommendation from a friend who raved about how secluded and beautiful it was although being in Honolulu. And she was right. At our arrival we were welcomed by the incredibly nice staff who even got us an upgrade for our room. The ocean view room (716) was just amazing, overlooking the sea, the secluded Sans Souci beach right in front of the hotel, Honolulu skyline and Kapiolani Park. If you stay here, get an ocean view room, it's worth it! Having breakfast and dinner (fantastic restaurant by the way!) on the lanai right at the beach without the feel of a huge resort or hotel complex - it couldn't get any better. If you like big resorts and pool areas this isn't for you. But if you want to experience this very private feel with an outstanding service, then come here. The waiters all looked like they really love their job. Isn't that what you wish for when you go out dining on your vacation - except the great food? Well, you figured it out, we enjoyed our stay there.
