Perfect setting, and the most amazing room with a huge jacuzzi bath. The service & food was superb. The only reasons for not getting 5 stars were small - firstly, they hadn't made our spa reservation even though we'd had an email confirmation and they were fully booked. This was obviously really annoying, but they did manage to sort something out in the end. Secondly - the bill - it was really confusing, and they charged us for things that were included in our package - it just seemed a bit sloppy. But, other than that perfect!

Room 18. All i can stay is what a wonderful, amazing place! The staff are friendly and room service great. I was travelling with a baby and we got put in the stableyard as it is their policy not to have babies staying in the main part of the house. Not that my little girl was a problem at all. The stableyard is a lovely seperate courtyard with a few rooms. We had a lounge upstairs and a steam room in the bathroom. I was not sure about the bath tub in the bedroom area as it was by the entrance, just seemed out of place and nkt like the romantic bath tub you would find at the end of the bed, but overall a nice room. I was disappointed as when i had requested a twin room, i expected the room to be ready as a twin room. I was with my sister, as we were having a spa break. But this was no big drama, as my sister decided to sleep on the sofa and we just requested another duvet. We were not allowed to eat in the resturant, as again we were with a baby, so we ordered room service, which was fantastic and tasted delicious. The first night we ate at the village pub. Nice place, but service was a bit slow and the food not as good at the house food. We ordered breakfast to our room and again this was fantastic. We were lucky that we had nice weather as walking around the garden was lovely the first day, although it rained so much in the morning, and our breakfast was never late! There is a farm at the back of the house and it was nice to show the cows to my little girl. I would definately return again and try one of the other rooms out in the stableyard.

We were greeted with such a warm welcome and all the staff were attentive, friendly and had permanent smiles on their faces and not just cause it was their job but because I truly believe they love working there (who wouldn't in the gorgeous building and grounds!). The food was fresh, locally sourced and excellent. We had a night at their pub over the road and the meal in their was one of the best pub meals I have ever tasted. Even when we went to leave we were offered 2 loaves of home cooked bread to take with us, with this and the hamper in the room that was there for us when we arrived with home cooked goodies and jams, I have no hesitation in recommending this stay to anyone, a bit pricey but definitely worth it!

We all enjoyed dinner, and then walked down the road to the Barnsley House's pub, where the reception was very friendly, and the decor was quaint and elegant all at the same time. We didn't have time to dine at the pub, but I would definitely do so next time. The location of Barnsley House is great for exploring the Cotswolds, and is not too bad a drive from Heathrow, even after a long flight.
