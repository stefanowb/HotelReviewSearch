When we arrived we called and were told to wait outside and it would be there in 15 minutes. After waiting 45 minutes we called again and were told they would be there in 10 minutes. We waited 20 more minutes. The third time we called they said they had no idea when the bus would come. At that point we jumped in a cab and paid our own fare to the hotel. We checked in and got our room. It was totally unacceptable. It had no view and it was next to a noisy ice machine and the elevators. When I asked to be moved I was told they had nothing else. The next morning I asked again and they said they could not accomodate my request. This made for an uncomfortable stay. Later I saw a bus full of people checking in. Obviously, they had rooms for over 40 people that just got off the bus. I was very disappointed with the service. Furthermore, they didn't have much knowledge for travelling tourists. I ended up walking next door to the Sheraton to get maps and information about the buses/trains. Pool/jacuzzi area was nice and our children loved that.", "title": "Just Average...", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "euscarol", "date": "August 13, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 3759593}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "used this on tail ends of a trip out west to be near airport - it's your standard \"by the airport\" hotel - clean, helpful - not much else to say as not much more than that was needed - their free shuttle to/from airport was hotel-paid cab service - a step down from a hotel-operated shuttle service where drivers help you with bags, etc., but worked for us and should work for everyone else", "title": "above average standard hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "joisey-joe", "date": "August 5, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3739919}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Very nice and affordable", "text": "Very clean, and has a nice upscale look to it.

This hotel definitely suffers from what lots of businesses in Alberta suffer from and that is lack of competent staff. We had booked a 4 night stay at this hotel and even phoned the night before to confirm that we would not be checking in until midnight on the first evening - so when we arrived at midnight and they said that they had overbooked and that there was not even ONE room for us to stay in I was not happy BUT I did not get angry at the staff or freak out at anyone even when the 4 staff members at the desk had NOT ONE CLUE what to do. They stared and stared at the computer and rolled their eyes at the screen blaming the computer for the fact that we did not have a room for the night. Then, nobody at the front desk had any idea exactly what was supposed to happen at this point - they kept disappearing behind the door and coming out with different excuses and saying that they didn't know what to do. Finally, they started phoning around local hotels trying to find us a room and when I explained that we had already pre-paid for the whole 4 days they said that it was up to us to pay for the new hotel room despite the fact that we had a late check-in and had already paid for their room!!!!! BUT, I kept my cool and did not yell or complain. The worst of it was that it was the staff that acted like it was up to us to take care of the problem and that we were the ones that were the problem. We ended up paying for the night at the other hotel and when we went back to the Greenwood in the morining the girl that was at the desk then said that we shouldn't have had to do that - they should have arranged the payment!!! They did reverse the charge in the end but that is not where the story ends. On the day that we checked out there was a bill slipped under our door that was a receipt for the stay - it was for only 3 nights but the problem is that having prepaid for the hotel already through the AirCanada website there is really no way for us to get any refund - when I talked to the website people THEY were mad that the hotel had given us a copy of their bill which showed a 95$ per night charge and that they are only being billed for 3 nights and yet we are being billed for all 4 nights and at WAY more than that!!! Thanks Greenwood Hotel for all your incompetence and showing over and over again that your hotel really has nobody on staff day or night that know what to do.. ... I have left messages for the manager to call me but, of course, she is probably spending the whole day babysitting her staff as they certainly need a lot of help. I felt the first night that I was checking in that I could have gotten behind the counter and done a heck of a lot better job than ANY of the staff and that is NOT a good thing. I feel ripped off and unhappy and I didn't even get to the part about the people trapped in the elevator!!! (Thankfully it was not US!!!) If you are planning a stay at this hotel all I wish for you is that you get some good help from the staff as we certainly didn't!!!", "title": "Bad experience!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Melster", "date": "October 18, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 10127808}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled on business", "text": "The hotel lobby is really nice and beautifull decorated. I found it really awkward standing in line waiting to check in because there were chairs in front of the desk and there was no other place to stand. The hotel only had one computer for guest use and this is a big place so that was one of the drawbacks. In addition the computer was out in the lobby and not in a business centre like other hotels of this class. The room were in good condition and only had a few burns in the rug. I was given a smoking room and couldn't change because the hotel was full.

They confirmed that they received the fax confirmation from my employer, and all was good. When I got there however, they said that my company had not faxed the correct information, so they were not going to give me my room unless I paid for it myself. I refused. The staff at the front desk were very rude, and dismissed me. When I asked if there was a phone I could use to call my travel agent, they pointed down the hall to a payphone. My travel agent called the front desk, I could see the staff person talking to her, and and then the staff person hung up on my travel agent! Finally, after I sat in the lobby for close to 2 hours, they gave me my room, but no apologies for the treatment or their error.
