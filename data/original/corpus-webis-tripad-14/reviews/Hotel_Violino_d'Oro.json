The hotel was newly renovated on our first stop. It\u2019s gotten a bit frayed since then. The rooms are small, dark and filled with the heavy damask drapes and stuffed furniture so common to Venice everywhere. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still an ok and relatively reasonable place to stay in the San Marco area of Venice. It\u2019s right across a small canal with gondoliers from the Bauer Grunewald, a very chi chi upper bracket place on the square of the San Moise church. The primary problem is its proximity to the Piazza San Marco. And the gondola station right along side it doesn\u2019t help at all. Truly at one point we had to elbow our way through a Japanese tour group standing three or four deep haggling with the gondoliers for prices on their gondola rides. If you\u2019ve been to Venice more than once, you don\u2019t need that kind of hassle. Better to stay on the Dorsoduro and pick up some tiny slivers of neighborhood life and some peace and quiet but without it feeling dead. I think we\u2019ll return to the Ca Pisani there next time.
