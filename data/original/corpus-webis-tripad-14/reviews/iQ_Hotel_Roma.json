We opted for pastries and coffee at a coffee bar/liquor store just on the other side of the opera house.

Our impressions after a three night stay last month are these: CLEAN...not a speck of dirt or dust anywhere. MODERN...looked and felt brand new with no signs of wear. EFFICIENT...between the helpful desk clerks, housekeeping, and breakfast staff, we never lacked anything we needed. The hotel features an inexpensive laundry facility (no need for detergent as it is included in the machine) and vending machines that contain everything from feminine products to champagne at a reasonable cost. For example, water was cheaper in the machines than we found on the streets. We also enjoyed a nice bottle of Italian red wine for a whopping six Euros one night and could have purchased smaller bottles for less than that. LOVELY...the decor is typical modern European...think in terms of Ikea! An exceptional feature is the rooftop terrace which can be enjoyed in the morning during the breakfast buffet or the evening with the bottle of vino you just purchased from the machine! The terrace has plenty of comfortable seating and heat lamps to take away the night chill. We also enjoyed the gym facility and the sauna which, though small, were enough to maintain fitness. UNEXPECTED...we read other reviews suggesting that the breakfast buffet was overpriced and underwhelming...however our experience was just the opposite. The array of meats, cheeses, fruits, desserts, breads, salads, cereals, and beverages was staggering and delicious. For the price (10 euro) we ate enough high quality food to get us through longs days of walking through the Eternal City. The beverage machine alone is worth the price as I drank four excellent cappuccinos that would have cost me close to 7 euro alone. CONVENIENT...we found the location to be superb...close enough to walk to all of the major central attractions (we could reach the Forum in less than ten minutes or be at the Trevi in about the same) yet isolated enough to be quiet at night. The proximity to Termini was not problematic at all. In fact we walked though the area late at night and felt completely safe.

The concept of the iQ hotel is to keep the room price as low as possible while providing the customer with a very good level of comfort. For example, the hotel doesn\u2019t have a big restaurant or an expensive bar but instead an array of vending machines that provide the guests with all they need at prices that are even cheaper than the shops. There were laundry machines for a few Euros instead of an expensive laundry service. There is a fridge in the room that I was able to put drinks and light food items without being embarrassed of walking through the hotel lobby carrying plastic shopping bags. I didn't have my laptop with me although there was a free WiFi service but I was able to check my emails in the well equipped business centre for a few euros. There is a huge roof garden equipped with drinks machines of nice Italian wines and beers, snacks and sandwiches. The hotel was very modern and very nicely decorated, the room including the bathroom was spacious and comfortable and also quite which is a big plus considering being in such a noisy city like Rome. The bathroom had basic essentials like shampoo, soap, bath foam and a shower cap, anything else was available at the iQ shop across the corridor for a few coins.
