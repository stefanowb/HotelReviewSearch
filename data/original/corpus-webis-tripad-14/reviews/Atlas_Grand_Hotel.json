First, it was widely reviewed as being an excellent hotel, although I have since noticed that some of the favorable reviews are quite dated. Second, its restaurant and bar were very well reviewed in several guidebooks and websites, and I was looking forward to trying some of its Bavarian specialties and hearing some live music there. Third, it supposedly offered room service, which I sometimes enjoy as a special treat when on vacation (ah, breakfast in bed). In addition, the location was good, it was historic and sounded like it had a lot of local character, the price for a single was reasonable, it took credit cards, and it offered hair dryers in the room.", "helpfulness": 30, "user": "lisak12", "date": "June 3, 2004", "id": 2149130}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "posthotel perfection", "text": "When I arrived at the hotel in late afternoon/early evening, I was met by a sign on the front desk written in German and English, stating that the hotel's credit card machine was not working and that they required all guests to pay in cash. This was disappointing, and required some logistical maneuvering on my part since there is a limit on the amount of cash one can withdraw from an ATM per day, and my ATM card did not work in many of the machines I tried. The woman working the front desk when I checked in (who seemed to be the only hotel employee there at the time) did not speak English, and unfortunately I speak very little German other than a few basic phrases. She could, however, understand some English, and when I checked in I said hopefully that maybe by the time I checked out 3 days later the credit card machine would be working. \"Nein, nein, nein,\" she replied as she shook her head emphatically. I thought this was curious. While she searched for my reservation and got the key for my room, I perused the \"Guest Comment\" book on the desk, which indicated that the credit card machine had not been working for quite some time, to the disappointment of quite a few guests.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "January 4, 2004", "id": 1537533}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful", "text": "I was given the key to room 50, which was on the 4th floor.
