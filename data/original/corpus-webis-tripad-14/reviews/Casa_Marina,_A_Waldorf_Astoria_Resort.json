The hotel grounds are gorgeous. Two large pools to choose from and they over look the ocean. We spent equal time between the pools and the large private beach. While drinks are a bit expensive at the tiki bar, you have to expect that at a 4 star hotel. Staying at this hotel is like staying in a piece of history. We love the 1920s character of the historic building and can't wait to book this place for next year again. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the service was first rate. We only had to ask for something once and it was taken care of immediately. The staff here are great. The location of the Casa is also excellent for renting bikes, which you can do right at the hotel, to cruise around Key West. In fact, we parked our car and didn't move it again until we left because we ended up riding bikes to Duval every day and evening when we went out. Bikes run about $20/day. You can also rent scooters and mopeds as well as wave runners and boats right on the property. We especially loved the breakfast every morning on the patio with an amazing view of the beach/ocean. We only ate breakfast at the Casa so I'm not sure what the rest of their food is like, but the breakfast was excellent. We will definitely be staying at the Casa Marina again and we're already looking forward to our next trip to Key West.", "title": "Absolutely Beautiful and First Rate", "user": "ardmoreflyer", "date": "April 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27698549}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We just arrived home from the the most fabulous vacation.

It is truely a luxurious resort. Yes, there is that resort fee that people keep complaining about, but they do tell you about it when you reserve the room- this should be no surprise. Bob and Steve will cater to your every need at the pool and beach alll day. This is a perfect hotel to bring the kids to. The pools were great and we looked forward to the popcicles and frozen towels every afternoon. They showed a \"dive in\" movie at the pool one night we were there that was fun, too. It is at the quiet end of Duval-but still an easy walk with older kids(7 & 10) to Mallory Sqaure, we did cab it back for $12. We biked everywhere-no car needed. I suggest eating at Salute which is around the corner on the beach-great food and atmosphere. Our favorite place for excellent expresso and a quick breakfast was Anna's Cuban cafe just a couple of blocks away from the hotel. We can't wait to return!

We had the buffet breakfast one morning and sat outside to dine. While we (and several other tables) were enjoying our breakfast (food ok - overpriced) a maintenance man was mopping the entire area (with a huge, stringy mop). While he didn't literally ask us to lift our feet to get under our tables, he did get mighty close! And one day the maid came and woke us at 9 AM to clean the room. We asked her to come back later and she never came back! We finally asked the front desk to have our room made up in the mid-afternoon and then were left with NO TOWELS. It took THREE phone calls to actually get someone to bring up towels nearly an hour later! And the computers in the lobby that are for the use of guests are so slow that they are virutally unusable. Anyone we saw using them walked away frustrated that they were unable to check their email, etc.", "title": "VERY ROMANTIC", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Ugando", "date": "April 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27358722}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "In spite of the problems we did have a good time (the weather was wonderful, after all!) and I feel obligated to mention some of the good things.
