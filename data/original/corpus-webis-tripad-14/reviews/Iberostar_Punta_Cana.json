Every night we ordered steak but the cuts they have are not great (lots of fat) some cold cuts did not look appetizing but use your own judgement. Entertainment was a bit corny but enjoyable. I was not expecting Broadway shows. Staff is pleasant. One major letdown is that the hotel rooms do not have irons so we were wrinkled throughout our stay. You can have someone iron your clothes from the laundry dept. but we never did. The pool is wonderful and the beach is very nice. A short walk down the beach and there are stands that sell souvenirs. Whatever prices you are given, offer half or slightly less than half. You become a pro at haggling. We went on a tour to Saona island which was nice but I have seen better. This place does have nice shells along the beach and at the end of the trip we were taken to a spot way offshore where the water is waist deep. This was the highlight for me but it was only 30 minutes out of a whole day trip. My husband and oldest child (13 years old) went snorkeling at Marinarium with nurse sharks and loved it. He said our 4 year old could have gone as he saw a 2 year old on the trip. Overall, the hotel is very nice and clean and offer lots of activities for free as well as water activities (some free and some with a charge).

We never got ill, we drank the water at the restaurants, bars but brushed our teeth with the bottled water and drank bottled water on the beach. The food was good and the restaurants may look empty,, but they book every hour and leave empty tables for the next group so it appears to be empty. But the buffet was good for us.

The beach BBQ, bar and restaurant is great and they keep it very clean. The soda at a couple restaurants is flat but some are ok so it may just be the mix. The Saona island tour was a bust..the island is beautiful but the two hour catamaran ride and long bus ride was a down side, and actual time on the island was only about 2 1/2 hours. snorkling was no good as the speed boats were in and out of the area and it was not safe to venture to far out so the sand was pretty kicked up.

Yes it did take you to their special place to shop but we were able to get some great deals, you also were taken to the rum factory with free samples and the Vivaldi cigar factory where you could sample the smokes.
