It was a very positive experience - our room was spacious and clean with a good bathroom and private patio. The breakfast buffet was extensive compared to most continental breakfasts and very good quality. Some reviewers have marked the hotel down on location as it is a 1.5km walk from the old town of Sirmione. We actually thought that this was a plus as the old town is very busy and can be noisy and the walk in was pleasant. Most evenings we actually walked in the opposite direction for 15 minutes to the centre of Colombare where there is a choice of good restaurants. All the staff are friendly but the hotel experience is enhanced by the extremely helpful Monika, who was full of good advice and always willing to look things up on her lap-top if she didn't know the answer. Our only slight complaint was that we thought from the hotel's website that all rooms had personal safes but ours didn't - this was immediately solved by Monika who placed our valuables in the hotel safe for our stay. A great little hotel.", "user": "mandcWestMidlands", "date": "October 7, 2009", "id": 46094241}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great hotel", "text": "Hotel Clodia is a lovely small hotel about 20minute walk from the centre of Sirmione. Our room was very nice (90 EURO per night), light, spotlessly clean, modern with a great balcony. The breakfast was very good with a good selection to choose from and the staff friendly. Although the 1-2km walk into Sirmione centre was not a problem for us, it may not be suitable for the elderly or anyone who doesn't want to walk. The walk into Sirmione is flat and runs down the side of the lake so was actually quite a nice stroll.

Monica in particular is very friendly & helpful and made us feel very welcome. We had a lovely room with a patio so could enjoy the sunshine, along with a bottle of wine ordered from Monica. Only criticisms would be that the shower was a little snug and we were disappointed that the coffee at breakfast was self-service from a Nescafe machine. However, we would definitely stay at Hotel Cloida again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value hotel at Lake Garda. Even though the hotel is not right on the lake, it is only a couple of minutes walk and there are also a couple of excellent restaurants within walking distance. I'm not sure of the amenities that the hotel offers - I suspect they are fairly limited but this is what I would expect from a small family type hotel such as Hotel Clodia.", "user": "MrJonesDublin", "date": "July 25, 2009", "id": 35766888}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Brilliant stay,will return.", "text": "Second stay at this lovely family run hotel.We were warmly welcomed back by Monica and the rest of the staff and really enjoyed our 10 night stay did not want to leave!

The hotel is tucked away off the main road up to the old town of Sirmione, which took us about 15 minutes to walk to. It is easy to find. Our room was room 14, which had two bedrooms (one with bunks) and a shower room. The air conditioning was quiet and effective, all the rooms were kept immaculately clean. There are lots of places in the garden where you can sit out and relax. The breakfast was fresh and again, the service was lovely. This hotel was great value for money, the ladies on the reception desk and at breakfast were all genuinely happy to help, and there was plenty of parking. The room at night was extremely quiet, bar some noise from next doors bathroom.

She even bakes fresh cakes for the generous breakfast you can have at the lovely veranda by the side of the house. Wonderful stay!!

The room was slighly cramped, but what else can we expect with 4 of us in one room.

We were not disapointed. We were greeted by the owner, a lovely young lady named Barbara, who showed us to our room, which was spotless and very comfortable, overlooking a beautiful garden and only steps to the promenade walkway along the lake to the Old Town a few minute's walk away (20). A delightdul water taxi was also available for transportation to the Old Town, again less than a two minute walk from Hotel Clodia. Breakfast was delightful with fresh croissants, cereals, fruits, eggs, cheese, cold cuts, jiuces and coffee daily. The pace is very relaxed, and Barbara was extremely helpful in making suggestions for day trips and restaurants, especilly the one by the Tower, frequented by locals with first class food and wines. All of the staff is very friendly at Hotel Clodia. After lunch, Monica, Barbara's long time friend comes on duty and she too is very friendly and helpful. The hotel exudes the warmth and charm of a family establishment that is modern yet quaint and well maintained.
