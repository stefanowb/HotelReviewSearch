The beach is public so be prepared to deal with peddlers who offer everything from excursions to marijuana- this got to be very annoying by the end of the week (and security doesn't seem concerned). I have been to Mexico, Dominican & Jamaica and the ocean in Barbados was the most swimmable- little-no undertow, not super deep etc. The resort offers many complimentary activities that add great value. Glass bottom boat trip was alright; viewed a lot of the coral reef & they let you off to snorkel with fish. Trip to Bridgetown: shopping tends to be in malls or department stores, super hot that day so we sought comfort in a pub. The catamaran trip was our favorite (free) excursion, beautiful trip towards the south coast and then you jump off and snorkel with turtles!

Actually, if you are buying rum, it was most affordable there (we checked at the local grocery store too). Island Safari tour was also enjoyable- you tour the north of the island in Land Rovers, great guides and at one point you drive very fast down a 'dirt road' for about 15 min of the trip. So, I would suggest saving your money and doing a normal coach tour of the island instead of paying extra for the Rovers. Oistins Fish Fry was also an experience- lots of food booths, jewelery & craft vendors, cheap beer and of course the drug dealers make an appearance too. We paid $35 US/ couple to take the bus from the hotel; if you do meet some people, maybe share a taxi- it would probably cost the same and you could come and go when you please. We also had Spa pedicures down the road (just past the Texaco) at \"Glo Salon & Spa.\" Lisa is the beautiful owner of this clean, relaxing spa- treatments are more affordable than the in-hotel spa and (from what our friend described) the pedicure was better.

We wondered if we would not get quite the same service. WRONG! The staff cannot do enough for you. When the hotel manager is shopping with the chef for your dietary needs ~ that's called personal unobtrusive service! I have numerous dietary problems which generally means I go without - not here. Special attention to detail was made and I did not have to forgo the afternoon tea and slight changes to offer alternatives on the main menu were made. The hotel is wonderfully on the sandy beach and you sit and listen to the ocean while eating in the restaurant in the open air under a veranda NOT 30 FEET FROM THE SEA. So relaxing. The hotel is overall very quiet and a little oasis. It is made clear to all at the manager's cocktail party weekly that if you have a problem they really want to know about it thus making your and future guests stay the best they can make it. It was suggested while we were there one day that a poolside drink waiter walk round and take orders - it happened and continued daily. Everyone makes you feel so at ease and even the gardeners wish you good morning. Shireen the manager is so \"on the case\" in the management of the site and a credit to the establishment. Even on our departure the chef came out to offer me wheat free sandwiches for the plane journey home in case the food was not good! Service over and above and so thoughtful. We would dearly love to go back if we can afford it. One tip: pay the extra and have a superior room; we were offered at no extra charge a complimentary room to wash and change before our flight home which was late in the day. The room was fine but not as large or in such a good location as the superior we had by the pool on the ground floor.
