The shower/toilet area had marble walls and floor. The ceilings and the walls in the suite appeared to be recently painted. The carpet was recently updated. The bedroom had 2 floor to ceiling glass walls and we had a great view of the ocean and pool through one wall/window, the other had a view of the beach at the Nassau Beach Hotel.

This resort is about 3 miles from the airport (a $15 flat cab fare) and is located next to 2 other hotels - all of which form the \"resort\". This is in an area known as Cable Beach and this hotel does have a nice private beach area with lounge chairs & non-motorized equipment available to rent. The general condition of the hotel is run-down. The hotel looks like it is in serious need of remodeling to bring it up to expectations (as well as the 21st century). My room had a balcony that faced the ocean and was a good sized room. But there were obvious signs of wear & tear in my room that could easily be fixed with some paint & new upholstery. All of the fixtures in the bathroom sinks & the tub itself were very outdated so it has a 1970's feel to it. The fitness center is rather large with a spa, steam room & sauna in the women's (and I assume men's) locker room. The fitness area has a lot of weight machines, especially for a hotel, although not a lot of cardio. It maybe had 3 treadmills (one out of order), an eliptical and 2 bikes.
