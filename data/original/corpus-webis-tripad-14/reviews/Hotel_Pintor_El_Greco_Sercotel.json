The elevator is comparable in size to most American hotel elevators and easily accommodates two guests and all of their luggage. The room is also very large (we booked a Superior Room). The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate. The only criticism that we had was the air conditioning ventilation. We stayed in room 102 and the vent for the air conditioning is on the wall, close to the ceiling alongside of the bed. My wife stayed on the side of the bed closer to the wall and had no problem.
