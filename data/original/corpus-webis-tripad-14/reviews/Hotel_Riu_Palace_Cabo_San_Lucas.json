Feb. 11-18, 2006. Very relaxing for a family of three that were in need of complete relaxation and enjoyment. My husband is confinded to a wheelchair and was able to get around well. The ramp from the main level to the pool was steep but with assistance he did fine. Our son was over joyed with the Mini Club. He really enjoyed the daily activities and the nightly movie. Our day's consisted of lounging at the pool and soaking up all the warm sun we could. As a family we adventured into town and did a little shopping. My son and I went on a glass bottom boat ride to Lover's Beach and got to see the sea lions. I enjoyed the parasailing with a friend I met.

But in the hotels defense we understand that they serve a large mass of people a day and know pleasing everyone is not possible. We loved the San Jose lunch but not their dinner meal. The breakfast buffet was excellent and our son enjoyed the pizza from all the restaurants. We wish they would have more of an American food selections, especially for kids, such as chicken finger, mac and cheese, vegetable soup, cookies, more cooked vegetables such as corn, green beans, sweet potatoes etc. The beds were very hard. The staff was very good. The drinks were good, it was hard to get use to the soda's because they have less carbonation than the US. We were pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel and our room.
