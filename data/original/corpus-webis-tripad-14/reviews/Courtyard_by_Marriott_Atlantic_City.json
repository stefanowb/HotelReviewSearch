Then we walked back on the boardwalk and to the hotel. The walk from the Boardwalk felt a bit quiet but there were some people around. The strange part was that we walked to the outlets Saturday afternoon and between the hotel and the outlets there were a lot of people looking very strung out and we even passed a two men doing a pretty obvious drug deal.

We usually only go for the day as overnight options are very limited- either very expensive casinos or dumpy motels- but when I saw Marriott had opened a Courtyard decided to try it as usually have good experiences with them. This was the exception. Property just opened, so you can expect some kinks, but not sure these can all be worked out. 1. Location- not good. Property is down S. Carolina Ave, which is not safe at night. Yes you can walk through Resorts, but then you have to still have to walk around an unlit parking lot. OK walk during the day, though. 2. Security- you enter through front where valets are or in back from parking lot with key. It is very easy for someone to follow someone in the back door. Further, there is no visible security in lobby or near elevators, and drunks in the elevator- even early in the evening- can be unpleasant. I did not like the fact solicitors from area restaurants were able to roam the motel and slip menus under doors. It is also a no pet (except service animal) facility and this was not enforced either.3. Housekeeping- ok, Towel quality is poor. I left phone charger in room near coffee pot and called to see if found, and never even got a response back. 4. Reception- not the greatest. Need some training in guest relations, and they also need a concierge. 5. Noise level- could always hear people in the hallways. On the positive side, the manager was very helpful in fixing an internet connection problem and getting us a soda and aspirin and I think he will try to remedy guest concerns. The valets were exceptional- always willing to flag cabs, assist with luggage- these guys would probably make a fortune in Las Vegas for same job. AC itself is a disaster- has gotten worse, not better, over the years despite the shops at the Pier at Ceasers and some upscale restaurants. (Red Square is still great). Be careful with cab drivers- one tried to extort an illegal rate from us, and when we refused, dropped us off on a dark street near the Tropicana.
