A DVD player was also in our room, with a selection of DVDs available for free. The owners provided exceptional service and called us by name each time we spoke to them. But the best part of the trip was the breakfast - absolutely delicious. Not your standard traditional Irish fare, but a big gourmet step up. I highly recommend the salmon omelette.
