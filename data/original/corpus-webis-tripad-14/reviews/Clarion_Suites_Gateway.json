When arriving at the hotel the check-in process was rushed and was not very friendly. We stayed for four nights and not once on walking into the hotel or through reception did any staff greet us with a \"good evening\" or \"good morning\". The front desk staff seem a little uninterested. When I asked for a shower cap the night staff advised me that they did not have any and to go and see the restaurant!?. I thought this was strange. Although the housekeeping staff do a great job at the cleaning of the room. Our room was perfect. The location was great. My suggestion to management is that they should consider responding to guest questionnaire responses thanking guests for their time and consideration in response. I left a detailed questionnaire and have heard nothing - no feedback - no thank-you. I work in the hotel industry as a front office manager and personally the service was poor. I understand that all hotels are different and staff have their good and bad days BUT we felt let down.
