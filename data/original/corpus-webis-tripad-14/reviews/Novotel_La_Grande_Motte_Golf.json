I had a first floor room with a garden view. The room was clean and comfortable. The shower was nice and provided adequate splash protection. The location was always clean and well maintained. Service in the restaurant and bar was amazingly slow but the beverages and meals were good. The bed was a bit uncomfortable for me ... a 6 inch foam mattress on a rigid support ... but it was OK. Parking was FREE ... very unusual. The rate was 99 euros including tax.
