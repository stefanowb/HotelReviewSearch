Being a Gold HHonors member, my partner was given free internet access which obviously saves money. We had also booked an exec level room as we wanted to relax in the lounge at the end of the day. The lounge, on the top floor, was small but served a nice breakfast including eggs, bacon and a big selection of continental food - cereals, cheese, ham, danish, muffins, toast - lots of choice and perfectly adequate to start the day. In the evening, the snacks on offer were hot (mini pastries), cheese, fruit, hams, vegetables etc. Again a great snack to relax with over the complimentary wine (the red was particularly good) The young lady in charge of the lounge was excellent - professional, courteous and utterly committed to customer service - we both thought she was a credit to the hotel. It was very relaxing to spend an hour with some wine and snacks watching all the differnt aircraft landing and taking off at the airport.

First of all be prepared for a walk to get there.. It took me some good 10 minutes of a brisk walk to rach the hotel. Mind you,the hotel is not in the terminal - once you reach the end of the terminal there is a short walk outside (not long, may be 50 meters) that can be not the most comfortable experience if it rains.. Check in - very quick and the staff was really friendly! The hotel itself is in need of renovation.. In some ways you feel like going back in time for 20 years.. The only thing telling you that this is 21 st century is a big flat screen TV: The furniture is old, not up to Hilton standards. Room is very small, the ventilation in my room did not work properly. Obviously as with every airport hotel the windows do not open. Internet is VERY expensive. 10 euros per hour, however they also have a 24h hour plan and internet is also included in some room packages. Room service - again expensive!! On the positive side, Schiphol Plaza is 10 minutes away with plenty of shopping/dining options available.
