Husband and I with two friends went to enjoy the Yulefest (at the Chalet). Peter is a true gentleman, his wife is lovely and his staff are so friendly. What a great atomosphere at Breakfast; you can chat with Peter as he cooks up your breakfast delights. Comfortable, beautiful, gracious appointments and centrally heated!! Peter even sorted us a take away breakfast box on our last morning as we were leaving very early to travel home. Lurline House is just a 10 minute walk to the Cafes and 3 Sisters, Ehco Point etc. Enjoyed an evening Port on the Chesterfield listening to Il Divo, this is the life.

After reading all the great reviews on Trip Advisor, I was a hopeful but a little frightened I might be disappointed. I need not have been. It was everything the reviews said and more. Peter was the perfect host - he made us feel at home and helped us out with dining venues and ways to see Katoomba. The breakfast was delicious - Peter makes the best omelette and needless to say the room was picture perfect and spotlessly clean. These things and all the extra little touches mentioned in the other reviews (sadly missing in many B & B's we have stayed at) put it head and shoulders above the rest. My one regret is that though our room was lovely, we didn't go the whole hog and book the spar room - something to look forward to next time.", "title": "Lurline House - ambience, quality and the best customer service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "HunterValleyGrandma", "date": "July 13, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34681335}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "P.S.
