The second room we stayed in on the other side of hotel was much quieter, but let's get down to the room. Both rooms had strange smell s. When the sun hits the room you can see dust all over the top of everything, the linen feels unclean and nothing is fresh. The faux leather poof (white) is filthy. The decor is very disco.

Here there is a Starbucks where you can pick up a tall brewed for $1.50. Bus stop outside if you fancy a jaunt downtown or maybe take a stroll to the Bellagio Conservatory (30 mins) if you are botanically inclined. Just enjoy the calm, tranquillity and light (and a drink or 5 from the regular cocktail service- recommend a white Russian!) Encore truly is so relaxing, you feel energised and chilled at the same time. Nothing is too much trouble.
