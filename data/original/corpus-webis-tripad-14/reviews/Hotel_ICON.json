Being an architect, i can appreciate the feel of a great quality hotel and this was definitely one of them. The frameless view at the end of the corridor when approaching your room was a sneak preview of what was to come. Although the room is smallish, the layout and setup is superb. The bed is positioned with full view of this spectacular harbour which glistens with neon lights in the night, and settles amongst mountainsides in the day. Wow. The tv is positioned perfectly for a layback with a number of channels from around the world (including the afl!). The bathroom is beautifully designed with a great looking sink bowl and sharp fittings. The bath has a flat glass panel tv for relaxing with a glass of wine and some sport.
