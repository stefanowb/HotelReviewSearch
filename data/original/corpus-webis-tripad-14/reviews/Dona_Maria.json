The hotel as a wonderful rooftop garden, complete with (small) swimming pool and bar; although it seemed to close rather early, and the door was locked so no late night viewing of the surroundings :-( Seville is a fairly compact city, and easy for walking round (with a good map! - lots of narrow, twisting streets). But to see all the main sites (Cathedral, Real Alcazar) you won't find a better located hotel. Other sites (Bull ring, university area, etc). are just a few minutes walk away. We paid 150 Euro per night (3 nights) and overall, I don't think that's a bad price considering the location and hotel quality in general. Our room was decorated to a very high standard, with quality fittings and fixtures. But the air con unit did seem rather lack lustre... Only real dissapointment with room was that, due to the hotel layout, it had no external windows - only a window opening onto a internal service column, so no view whatsoever and could feel a little claustrophobic with the lack of a window. Although I guess this kept the noise level down.... Breakfast was not included in our rate, and the supplement (15 Euro per person) seemed rather steep; but there are plenty of places nearby to use as an alternative. There is no restaurant at the hotel, but as you are right in the middle of everything, finding somewhere to eat will not be a problem; round the corner is the street 'Mateos Gago' which has plenty of tapas bars to sample.", "title": "Excellent location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jono_T", "date": "May 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7710778, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 No external windows in room"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Arrived on a friday about 1:30 pm.
