Some of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, some of them are the opposite. All of them have a problem with English. I especially hated the list which listed everything in the room with the cost of replacing it. When I used a tacky wooden handled knife and the room staff didn't replace it, they tried to charge me for it. When the person in charge of replacing mini bar items didn't turn up they tried to charge me three days in a row for the same items. Finally they just charged my credit card after I left in spite of the fact that I had explained the problem, slowly and carefully, to several different people. And they haven't replied to my protesting email. The location is good but there are lots of hotels in this area. When they organised a tour for me and the tour people forget about me and left me sitting and, when reminded, turned up in a taxi to take me for half a tour, there was no follow up and no apology. The breakfast was fine and the top floor restaurant and bar was nice with helpful staff. This could be a really good hotel but, at the moment, just doesn't make it. I suspect the lack of a native English speaker anywhere in the picture is the reason. Would I recommend it?

Literally on the door step of Ben Than Markets and the night food markets. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our room was very clean and serviced daily. (My 14 year old son reckons it was awesome). The bathroom was very clean with hot showers. For those who are travelling the region and want a good, clean and comfortable hotel, at a very reasonable price, I would certainly recommend this hotel. (Only down fall was there were only two small windows in the room - but we didn't spend much time in the room during the day). At US$100 per night with breakfast for 3 of us, you can't go wrong.
