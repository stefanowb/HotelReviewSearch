Stayed here for 3 nights with my family in interleading rooms. Convenient if u want to create one big room but the interleading doors opened in funny angles so was cumbersome to leave open all the time. Although there were plenty eating places, there wasnt much halal food. Just like everywhere we have been in Australia muslims pls b cautious on dubious food joints stating they are halal when they are not! Most of them are still listed on Zabihah.com and need to be removed. Not all Nandos are halal. Only the ones with halal certificates do not have bacon on their menu. Only one i found was at the Harbourside near the kids rides playground. Found a Madinah islamic centre just up the road from Marriott and a halal cafe next door serving curries just where u take the tram on La Trobe street. Many many thanks to Peter, Yasin and Harry whom have made our stay very comfortable and esp Harry and Emma who attended to our dietary needs at breakfast and room service.", "title": "Although not in a prime location but a great hotel", "user": "Naseem786", "date": "January 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 150069049}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Stayed there for a week,", "title": "Big room, great shower, king bed, giant tv,", "user": "JackOntheroad V", "date": "January 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149963936}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great staff, friendly, helpful and always happy and polite.", "title": "Enjoyable stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "VHILW", "date": "January 16, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 149790254}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Great room service meals.", "title": "Above & Beyond Service", "user": "Erin S", "date": "January 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 149632503}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The tennis was on and some of the players stayed there.", "title": "Marriott in Melbourne, Australia", "user": "Michael B", "date": "January 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 149537237}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Just checked out of a very well planned hotel.
