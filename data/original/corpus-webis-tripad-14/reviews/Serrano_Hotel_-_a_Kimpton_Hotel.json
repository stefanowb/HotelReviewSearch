Our room is small, but I expected that, so I wasn't disappointed. The bed is super comfortable: fluffy, clean, white comforter and fluffy pillows. The bathroom is marble with a sizeable tub with shower. Water pressure is fabulous. Aveda shampoo, conditioner and lotion is a nice touch. Towels are soft and monogrammed with an \"S\". The one problem with the bathroom is that you can't really sit straight on the toilet since it is so close to the wall.Cheetah bathrobes hanging in the closet and the toys and games they have in the mini bar area are just a fun idea. I goofed off with the etch-a-sketch for a while and my husband is still threatening to \"walk the dog\" with the yoyo. There is a safe and free internet access (wired, not wireless) and the items in the mini bar were not as ridiculously priced as some I've experienced in the past. Really good coffee is available in the lobby from 5am to 10am, and we didn't make it to the wine/beer reception, but they have that daily from 5 to 6. We got in late and ate dinner at the attached restaurant, \"Ponzu\" which was pricey but good with average service. All in all, it's been a really great experience. Every time we come back in, we're greeted with, \"Welcome back!\" and we've been happy to be back.", "title": "Wonderful hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "AussieLinda", "date": "November 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 10623272, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Furnishings and service", "disliked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I'm usually very cynical about hotels and don't typically write to praise a hotel.

There is no view except that of the parking garage from this room. Avoid the very over-priced honor bar - one small bottle of water is $4 and a bag of M&Ms is $5!
