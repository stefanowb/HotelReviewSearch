My only complaint was that there was only one buffet and one restaurant. They boast multiple restaurants, but that's misleading, because they only open one restaurant per night. They might as well claim that they have 13 restaurants, since they will rotate and open just one a night, anyway. Room service food was good and timely and it costs $2.50 per delivery charge. I hate being nickel and dimed. If you're going to call it an All-inclusive then please live up to your claim. Also, at the restaurants, there is a section on the menu which is extra charge, if you order items such as shrimp, steaks, lobster...etc. Again, if you're going to sell it as an all-inclusive, please be ALL-INCLUSIVE!!

A couple from Ohio that we met advised that they were disappointed in the food. They had only been eating at the buffets. We suggested they eat at a \"reservation\" restaurant and the next day they advised the food was great. The El Presidente is unique in the \"all inclusive\" world in that they have multiple sit down dinner restaurants. The restaurants all require a reservation. The resort must need a reservation in order to meet appropriate staffing at the dinners. I have been to the resort 4 times and have never had a problem getting a dinner reservation for the family. I simply see the concierge before 11A.M and make a reservation. The sit down dinners at the 3 restaurants are great and simply make the resort. Each restaurant specializes in something different and it is a relaxing way to spend the evenings. The dinners last about 2 hours and you get everything from appetizers to dessert.
