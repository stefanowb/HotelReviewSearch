It is a pleasant enough hotel but we felt that we had a bad deal room wise. It was nicely decorated but was pretty small and the bed didn't even look like a full size double. We didn't complain as we assumed that all rooms would be this size, however we noticed a couple of bedroom doors whilst being cleaned and the rooms were far bigger, perhaps we just got this because we were late arriving and that was all that was left. The staff are very friendly and helpful although I agree with previous reviews re. the housekeeping. We went out for a few hours, came back at 3 pm and our room hadn't been made up which seemed a bit off given that there were lots of staff around. The breakfast is excellent - buffet style with lots of choice, and it's all organic. The location of the hotel is great - walking distance to everything, and lovely views over the water.", "title": "Great Location", "user": "JosieH", "date": "February 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 13800027, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location and breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 room size"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I chose this hotel as when I booked it was the number 1 hotel in Tromso on Trip advisor, I see it has now slipped to 5 and I am not surprised.", "title": "Loved Tromso, shame about the hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TravelBug47648", "date": "February 15, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 13578809, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Compliments to the chef", "disliked": "\u2014 Small rooms and cleanliness was significantly below expectations"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled solo", "text": "Rooms:", "title": "Warm, Clean & Enjoyable", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "seannorman", "date": "January 27, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 13053619}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "The rooms on the 1st floor are small and there is very little space to hang clothes, we were staying for 6 nights so this was an issue for us.
