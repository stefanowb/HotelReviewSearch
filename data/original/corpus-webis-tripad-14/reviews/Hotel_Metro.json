They were great at recommending restaurants and activities for our stay, and were overall very nice! The room was a good size, with good amenities within, and great toiletries.

There were yummy bagels, muffins, cinnamon toast, cereal, fruit, & juice. The breakfast goes until 11am, which works out great for those late mornings after a long night exploring! The rooftop deck offers a great view of the Empire State Building, which is a must-see. Another plus is the great location. We stayed here based off everyone's reviews about the great location, and were definitely pleased! There are subways literally steps away, which works out great.
