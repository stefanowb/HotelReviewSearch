I chose it because it has a great location for tourist spots although there aren't many places to eat around there. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but they do have a breakfast area. I decided to book myself and 2 colleagues here because it was budget friendly and I knew the locale and as we were on business we had a tight budget. What a disappointment this turned out to be. I paid extra for a view of the bridge, my friends didn't and they got a view of a parking lot. The wall in my room was covered with mildew as were the curtains but then again so were my friend's rooms. The room seemed clean enough but on the second day I was there I noticed about a dozen or so tiny tiny bugs crawling all over the flush tank of my toilet. I called to the front desk at 7 am when I noticed them and asked them to send someone up to check it out, I had to call again at 8 am and at 9 am I went out to the hallway and found the housekeeper. I told her what the problem was and she said she had it on her board to do. She also said she couldn't spray the room until I left. I was at meetings all that day and with a major conference in the city couldn't get another hotel to go to. I also didn't want to separate from my colleagues. I did leave the room and was gone for 5 hours. When I came back, my room still hadn't been touched. I called the front desk and asked to speak with the manager and was told he was helping someone else but would call me back within 5 minutes. I waited almost 1/2 hour and eventually went downstairs to the lobby. I didn't want to discuss this in front of other guests but was really pushed to do so. The manager was apalled and said this was the first he'd heard of it. He assured me the room would be done immediately and the bathroom would be sprayed. He couldn't tell me what these creatures were. I had an event that evening and when I came back at 1 am I noticed they were still there and still as many of them as when I left earlier in the day. I called downstairs and at 2 am I had to pack up my things and move to another room. I checked out that following morning. When I mentioned to the front desk staff she said it was my fault because I had eaten a banana in the room the day before and these were fruit flies. I actually work in the Health Dept. and explained to her that fruit flies need more than 12 hours to incubate and that fruit flies fly, these little critters were crawling and weren't even near the garbage can that I had used. The staff at the front desk were less than helpful with things I needed (ie FedEx form for a package I needed to send). I was so paranoid about bringing something home with me that I emptied my suitcase in the garage and even the new sweaters etc. that I bought I washed and dried immediately before I would bring them into the house. This was the worst treatment I have ever received. I only signed on to this site so I could warn others what this place is really like. The pictures must be years old and really do not represent what this hotel is really like.

We took a walk ,had some lunch and returned at 3 pm,I booked this trip at least 4 months before taking it so I thought the requests I had made would be honored.We asked upon booking the trip for both rooms to be either facing the city or the bay and neither were,that was dissapointing as the view from both rooms on the 4th floor were facing an apartment building, we had also requested one of the two rooms be a smoking room, we were told they did not have one available and that if anyone smoked in that room there would be a hefty charge added on to our credit card.No big deal, as we weren't in the room much other than to sleep so we went outside if we wanted to have a smoke. The room itself was not bad, comfy bed, lots of pillows,decent size television, the bathroom however was not the greatest, it was tiny and no window and no fan? I thought that was odd, plenty of hot water and a nice size tub so that was a plus. There was internet available to patrons for free in the breakfast room but a sign was posted on it saying it wasn't working- when I asked at the front desk about when it may be available to use they were unable to tell me ,just got a lot of hmmm? I am not sure.......it was still not available come monday afternoon. There is a pop/juice machine on each floor, after a long day of walking around the city we went back to our room for a break and to get ready to go out for dinner- walked down to the pop machine to get a drink and a sign was posted-out of order, no problem- hopped the elevator to another floor and the same thing there - out of order-after trying 3 floors I gave up - walked across the street to the store and purchased some drinks.The breakfast room was pretty good - a good assortment of fresh fruit,danish,muffins,hard boiled eggs ,tea,coffee,juice and waffles,never had a problem finding a table to eat at but after 8am it got quite busy.We saw alot of the city in 4 days - Alcatraz is amazing , Fisherman's Wharf was also a fave -- so much going on there and some great food available - we really liked eating at Nick's Lighthouse , the seafood there was awesome. Rented a car and drove to Napa and Sonoma valley - went to a winery called Rosso & Bianco, it is owned by Francis Ford Coppola and it was absolutely amazing ! You could sit on the terrace and have lunch,or for $10 you could do a little wine sampling which was nice , the gardens are well kept and so pretty .We also did the double decker bus tour in the evening for $15 a person ,well worth it as we were able to get some fantastic pictures - a great way to see the city! I would definately go back as 4 days was just not enough to see everything, however - I would try a different hotel next time , the people running this hotel didn't seem to really know what they were doing . feel free to contact me at debrab60@hotmail.com if u have any questions.", "title": "Average Hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "tinydancer", "date": "October 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10449369, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 15 minute walk to Fisherman's wharf", "disliked": "\u2014 no view"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were quite happy with this hotel although we did not realise before we arrived that there was no restaurant.
