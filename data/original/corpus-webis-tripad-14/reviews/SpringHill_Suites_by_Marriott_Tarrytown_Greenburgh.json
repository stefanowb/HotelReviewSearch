It was our second or third time here but we hadn't been back in the past year. The rooms no longer look \"new.\" The quality of the linens, pillows, and beds is poor--they are still using the Jamison brand mattresses that we thought Marriott had abandoned because they are so far inferior to every other chain hotel. Our room was particularly small this time. To call it a \"suite\" is ludicrous. The furniture was much too big for the size of the room. It was also laughable (sadly) that this was a \"handicapped\" room because it was certainly difficult to negotiate your away around the furniture even without mechanical assistance. A wheelchair would have fit in the bathroom but nowhere else. On the positive side, the breakfast was surprisingly good and the entire hotel was quite clean. All in all, if the price had been $30 less than the $139 rate we were paying, we would not have had much to complain about.
