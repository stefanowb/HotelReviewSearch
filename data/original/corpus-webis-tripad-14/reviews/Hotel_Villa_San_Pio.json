The hotel is nestled in a wonderful small wooded mediterranean garden with terraces and balconies for everyone to enjoy. Since it was winter time, most of the furniture on the terraces had been taken in, but there were heatlamps outside on the restaurant terraces that made my evening Lemoncello cozy. The restaurant (open evenings only) is 4 star, but take a taxi \"downtown\" and enjoy the local flavor. The positive and negative to this hotel is it's location on the Aventine hill which requires a short site filled cab ride to the Pantheon, but, as I mentioned, it's a very quiet oasisi in a very busy loud city. The staff is very helpful and taxis are readily available and quick. The staff speaks English and the hotel is maintained impeccably.

The hotel occupies three small buildings surrounded by lush landscaping, with the excellent restaurant housed on the ground floor of one. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, with particularly good crusty rolls. Dinner was also fine, but there are a number of good, less expensive places down the hill in Testaccio if you're in the mood for something less elaborate. We particularly liked Il Cantinone, which is billed as a pizzeria but offers much more, and Remo, which is bare bones with terrific pizza. Rome is a big, busy city and staying at the Villa San Pio is a great way to be near its heart but away from it all at the same time.
