For the standard of hotel this is, would have appreciated a widescreen TV rather than the bog standard one. No iron in the room which, given the massive amounts of wardrobe space, is a shame. Massive shower head but very little pressure so more of a dribble (at all times of the day) Also no bathrobe. Thought breakfast was a little disappointing, especially the cooked items. Not great quality, not hot enough. The location of the hotel isn't ideal for the tourist as it's quite a way from the centre. The actual area around the hotel is pretty uninspiring unless you want to visit a deserted and decrepit tiny mall or McDonalds.", "title": "top class hotel", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "GETawayPEOPLE", "date": "October 23, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6002816, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 top class hotel rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}], "location": {"country": "Portugal", "region": "Northern Portugal", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 17, "very good": 145, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 315}, "aka": "Tiara Park Atlantic Porto Hotel Porto", "slim_ranking": 0.0444444444444, "description": "Situated in the heart of Porto, the principal city of Northern Portugal, the Tiara Park Atlantic Porto is one of the main landmarks of the Avenida da Boavista business district.
