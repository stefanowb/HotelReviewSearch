To be frank, I doubt very much if we'd have done this if it hadn't been a special offer. Glad we did as it allowed us to discover a very different bit of the country. Illueca itself is nothing special, the hotel being easily the most outstanding building there. Following our SatNav meant an approach from the back of the hotel up a very precarious narrow road. We discovered a much safer approach the following day! The surrounding villages and area, however proved most interesting, with more than enough monasteries, castles and ancient sites to visit.", "title": "Great situation", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "disleksik", "date": "September 21, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 118413321}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed our stay although found the hotel rather soulless and definitely understaffed.
