Couldn't understand previous comments about swimming pool not easy to find as I found signposting fine, maybe they've improved it...certainly very large and airy swimming pool, they claim the biggest in London with natural light and its on the top floor ! Didn't swim in it myself but it looked very tempting. Room was amazingly quiet despite closeness to Big Ben chimes and the traffic on the bridge. We had afternoon tea in the old Library overlooking Thames which was real old fashioned English afternoon tea (tip- you need to book a table ahead at reception,there are 2 sittings ) - with scones, jam, cream, cucumber sandwiches etc, in wood panelled period room - expensive but one tea was enough for nearly 3 of us. Breakfast next morning was fresh and well presented. Beds were super comfy. Overall a very convenient place to stay, seemed to be very popular with business travellers, especially Americans, so probably not so child friendly.

The hotel usually, but not always had a person right inside the front door, but we were never asked if we were guests. You could come in the back door by Waterloo and never pass an employee before getting on the elevator. I would have felt much safer if they had installed an elevator that you needed to access with your key or even a code like the pool. Keep in mind the London Eye is right outside and they sweep the pods for bombs after each group exits. The staff had left the door to the office in the reception area open our last evening and one of our sons could clearly see a clipboard with bomb threat information printed on it in big letters!!!??? Needless to say I did not sleep that night. There had been demonstrations going on all week on Westminster bridge and parliment square with police in full riot gear.

However, the rooms we felt were very dated and tired no bedside table on one side of the bed, wardrobes not sliding ( were in fact broken) the beds were not comfortable and the air conditioning noisy. Not wanting to go on but these were just some of the issues. Now to breakfast ...an adjoining guest asked for some bacon as there was a problem with supplying a steady continuity of food ( this appeared to be a problem for the staff to keep this replenished) the staff member was unaware of the difference between sausage and bacon and pointed to the pan of sausages only to be told by the guest that it was bacon he would like not sausages! There was little choice of bread and we had to toast this ourselves amongst a queue of guests and beside a table of diners being jostled and knocked as other guests were accessing their food.

We did not find this location to be a convenient one for us as almost all the activities we were interested in were on the \"other\" bank. In addition, we were disappointed with this property. It did not seem to be run as a luxury hotel and we found it to be inconvenient in several respects. Although we were upgraded to a \"river view\" room and did have a clear view of the Eye and Big Ben, the walk from the elevator to our room seemed equivalent to a half-mile stroll along the river (or perhaps two revolutions of the Eye). Although we like to walk when we are outside, we quickly grew tired of this journey. The room itself was on the small side (as was the bathroom) and we were surprised to find that only one tiny bar of soap was dispensed by the housekeeper for the room, which necessitated moving it from sink to bath each time we used it. We received executive lounge privileges, but this was a poor excuse for a concierge lounge. There was no concierge present in the lounge (only housekeeping staff) and the breakfast provisions were skimpy at best. The room was not attractive and had no windows. There were two computer terminals at the entrance (only one of which worked) and their location was such that guests entering the lounge could (and did) easily mistake you for a hotel employee when you were at the keyboard. One of the main reasons we selected this hotel was because of the pool, which looked quite attractive on the website. We used it only once, however--once was enough--as half the pool was consumed with a water aerobics class (for one or two persons) with accompanying loud and disturbing rock-type music. The one lane that was available for lap swimming was narrow and shared by multiple swimmers. It was the antithesis of relaxing. By way of comparison, the Park Lane Marriott has a beautiful, serene pool. We also quickly grew tired of the walk to Waterloo Station, which took approximately 10 minutes (longer if you did not discover an unauthorized shortcut through the office portion of the County Hall complex).

I paid 75GBP for one way transportation from London Heathrow- Shame on me on not researching on my own as I overpaid by about $50US. When I arrived to the hotel there was no bellman or anyone to assist with my bags up the 10-12 stairs in the front of the hotel. I proceeded to the front desk, nobody was standing at the front desk - I said hello and a gentlemen from the back office came to assist me. I was thrilled to be able to check-in as I arrived at the hotel. One of the Managers checked me in - a gentlemen from Spain. He acknowledged my gold status, advised how I go about getting the internet and provided me with a key for the executive lounge (an amenity for Marriott Gold, Platinum and guests choosing to pay up for lounge access) He apologized that the only room he had available was a room with a handicap bathroom and no rooms with views were available - I offered to pay as well, but he said unfortunately no other rooms were available - I said no problem as I was happy I was able to check in at that time. I made my way up to room 330. I knew my room was going to have a lousy view when I had to make a little turn off the hallway to get to my room - the room was opposite to \"Service\" room. When I attempted to enter my room the key didn't work - I tried the other one, still didn't work. I lugged my suitcase down the long hallway and returned to the front desk, the gentlemen who checked me in was not there, instead it was a woman who said the keys should work and to try again --- Didn't even make new keys. She said she doesn't know why the keys aren't working. She said if they don't work use the phone in the hallway to call us instead of coming back down - Went back to the room, keys didn't work. I found the phone at the very end of the hallway - across from the furthest room from the elevator. Why wouldn't the phone be in a better position? Like, by the elevator perhaps??!! I pressed 0 and the woman who I just spoke with at the front desk answered - I advised her that my keys don't work, I was upset it was taking this long to get into my room, I am no better off then I was 10 minutes ago when I last spoke to you at the front desk - between the trip back to the front desk and the trek to find the phone it took me 10 minutes and still not in my room, then she asks \"are you in your room now.\" I said did you understand anything I said\" - she said I don't think so - You know that whole English thing in England is tricky. Why in the world would a front desk representative at 4-5 star hotel not fully understand English? We are in England???????? Infuriating. She then connected me with someone else, the women I spoke with advised me someone from concierge will be up with new keys. 5 minutes later a gentlemen named Simon came up and helped me out - Simon was actually quite helpful. His key also didn't work! He tried it a few times and it didn't work, finally he was able to get the door open. We got inside the room and he called down to the front desk manager - advised her the lock was dead and I wished to change rooms as I didn't want to incur any further problems with gaining access to my room during my stay. I was concerned because the the manager who checked in me said this was the only room available - it had to be one of the worst rooms at the hotel given the view. We were in the room for about two minutes while he called the front desk - I took a look at the view - terrible - an interior view, looking at other rooms, maintenance area, etc. The front desk manager told the gentlemen Simon to move me to room 324. We got to the room just a few doors down, but on opposite sides of the hall and wouldn't you believe it a room with a great view just to the left of the London Eye! I suppose it was a good thing that the lock was dead as I was able to be moved to a room with an excellent view - However, I was very disappointed that this room was available when I checked in. I was either flat out lied to to or the manager who checked me in was incompetent.
