Its 2 minutes from Las Ramblas so close to all the major tourist attractions and metro lines. However, its also only 2 minutes from the Eixample and Gracia areas where there's some fantastic shopping and eating to be had, away from the majority of the tourist hustle and bustle. It is on a main road so has the potential to be a little noisy at night but it didn't really bother us.", "title": "Perfect Location", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "theweebludug", "date": "April 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4953019}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "The rooms are very clean and well decorated, staff friendly and efficient and continental breakfast sufficient.", "title": "super budget hotel", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "itchyfeetlady", "date": "November 28, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4147885}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "Be warned the rooms can be quite small so if you are used to loads of space and living in the lap of luxury this may not be the hotel for you.

It fitted our criteria of A/C,fridge,non smoking and a safe in the room. We booked it through Expedia in July before we set off on a long trip and it was amongst the most expensive hotels we stayed in. 129.00 Euros room only. And the least value for money. The lobby is tiny, as is the lift. Needless to say so was the room. The bed was so small it can\u2019t even have been a double. It was downright uncomfortable too. There was no night table by the window side, so we pushed the bed against the window wall to be able to move at all. We were falling over our bags as it was. The wardrobe was minute There was only room to hang up 2 jackets, and was really only the entry to the water downpipes.
