I was attending a workshop at the Omega Institute with Brian Weiss (Past Life Regression Therapy) and this was the closest hotel (17 miles) I could find that was pet friendly. It was right off Rte. 199 and the Thruway so it was convenient. It is your typical Holiday Inn with the indoor pool and whirlpool (in the Holidome) that was most likely built in the 1980's. Half the rooms are interior and face the Holidome and half face the outside. I was given an inside room because it was conveniently located on the first floor near one of the exits. The carpeting in the hallways was worn and somewhat dirty. The room was big, with a king size bed, dresser, desk, loveseat and coffee table. It was equipped witha hairdryer, iron, ironing board and coffee maker, but no refrigerator. The furniture was clean but worn looking. The bathroom was a typical Holiday Inn bathroom but it did have one of those curved shower curtains that made the shower seem bigger. The shower controls were fine and they provided the amenities of shampoo, body lotion and soap, which were the Body Shop brand, which I thought was relatively upscale for a Holiday Inn. There were plenty of fluffy towels available that I did not need a towel change. However, I did see the maid on the third day and asked for extra shampoo. She happily gave me two bottles. It should be noted that this is a 100% non smoking hotel and it appears that the rule was followed by the other guests given the number of cigarrette butts in the parking lot. (There was a trucker's convention there while I was there but other than the cigarette butts and various trucks in the parking lot one would not have realized they were there) I was hoping that the interior room would not be noisy and it was fine. Actually, I liked the amount of darkness the interior room provided for sleeping.

They provide pool towels at the pool and one night I accidently brought them back to the room but happily there was no penalty for this (which was nice). The fitness room was clearly an afterthought, with very limited equipment. Room service was excellent, since I took all my meals (except for lunch, which I had at Omega)at the hotel in the room (because of the dog). It should be noted it was always delivered with 8-10 minutes of ordering, rather than the 20-25 minutes they told me when I ordered. The food was always hot and correctly prepared (I usually ask for minor modifications to the meal).They were equally swift in terms of picking up the tray-even though I never called them to pick up the tray it was usually picked up within 5 minutes of me putting it outside the door. This is a nice change from some of the hotels I have stayed in where breakfast trays are still outside the door at dinner time. It appears that any staff member that walks by a tray will pick it up and bring it back, not just the restaurant staff. I cannot comment on the maid service because I kept the Do Not Disturb sign on the door while I was out because of the dog. It should be noted the first day I was at Omega I received a message to call the front desk when I got in. They reported to me that my dog had been crying and barking (she does this when I initially leave her) and she had woken a guest at 5:30AM with her vocalization. I told them that she was sleeping with me at 5:30AM and it certainly was not her because if she vocalized at 5:30AM I definitely would have woken up, and I did not wake up that morning until the wake up call at 7:15AM (wake up calls were always on time at this hotel) and I did not leave the hotel until 8:30AM.

The holidome may have been cool in the past (maybe it still is and I am just too old to appreciate this), but this place has a somber, depressing mood hanging over it. There is a weird smell in the hallways (even though it is a non-smoking facility), and the place just looks and feels \"tired\". The carpeting in the hallways is buckled and coming up in several places which actually makes walking on it quite treacherous if you're not paying attention. The hallway carpeting was also very filthy. I stayed in the executive wing and it was no better than anywhere else. The tub and bath fixtures have seen better days and there are obvious areas where there has been water damage on the ceiling and shabby repairs made to cover it up. The room itself was clean and the bed had updated bedding & nice pillows. The decor wasn't too bad as it looked like they had made an effort to modernize the pictures, walls and fixtures. The TV was still an old CRT, no flat screens here. For the price I paid (approx. $140 during a week night), I expected more. The internet did come with the room at that price, but no breakfast. I did not eat on the property and their were very few guests dining or in the bar although the hotel was moderately full. Perhaps this would be an OK place to stay if you had young children and it was conveniently located to the attractions. The pool & game area looked dark, dingy and had no music or lively atmosphere but hey! who cares if your a kid and you have a handful of tokens to enjoy?? All in all I would not stay here again as I think I could get more for my money elsewhere. Oh, the front desk staff did not seem professional at all, although pleasant for the most part. You also have to drag your luggage quite a ways and carry it up stairs by hand as there is no elevator. Be prepared if you have kids or a lot of stuff to carry that you will be making several trips up and down stairs unless you get the first floor.", "title": "The worst", "user": "dianehayes", "date": "August 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 116608031}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Hotel staff (esp front desk) very unpleasant.
