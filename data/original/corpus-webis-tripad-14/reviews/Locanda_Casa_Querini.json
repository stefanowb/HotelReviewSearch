The service here was great, some of the best I've received anywhere. The reception and breakfast staff were very helpful and friendly. E.g. We had to check out early, prior to when breakfast would ordinarily be served, so the B&B organised an early breakfast for us. The location is good, it's very close to San Marco square, the big tourist spot in Venice, but I found it was still quiet enough so sleeping was never a problem. Whilst the decor and furnishings in the room were old, the room was large and comfortable. The only real negative thing about the place was that the shower cubicle was very small. The other thing is that noise within the B&B carries somewhat, so you can hear other guests walking around in their rooms. The other guests staying at the time of our stay were not noisey so this wasn't a problem for us, but it could conceivably be if you had bad neighbours.

However, after returning from dinner one night they opened the breakfast room up for us so we could sit with our friends and discuss our day and plan the next.
