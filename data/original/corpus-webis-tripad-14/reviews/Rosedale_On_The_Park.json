We tried to book via the on line web site but it wasn't a secure site so we booked through expedia. Apart from that slight hitch we had a fantastic time, when we checked in we were told that we were going to be upgraded to a larger suite and it was fantastic. We had a seperate bedroom with a very comfy bed and a larger sitting room with kitchenette. The staff were all very friendly and we tried out the room service and the food was fantastic. We ate breakfast in the hotel and got the buffet for $70HK each, a discount of 30% because we were guests.

The Hotel itself was much smaller than expected but the location to an MTR Subway station and Victoria Park was nice. There are stores and restaurants within easy walking distance. Our room was amazingly small for 2 adults with full sized bags. If you are over 6 foot tall, you may find the bed to be too short. Floor space is almost non-existent in a room with two beds\u2026 if someone is sitting at the desk, the other person has no choice but to climb over the beds to get past. The bathroom is on the small side too\u2026 almost no counterspace for two people to put their stuff. Our non-smoking room was very clean, and well maintained. Our view from the 12th floor was straight into an old apartment building so basically we keep the curtains closed. Rooms closer to the top of the building have better views over the building we faced. FREE internet access in the room was a nice touch and if you don\u2019t have a computer, they have one available free in the Sky Lounge on the top floor.
