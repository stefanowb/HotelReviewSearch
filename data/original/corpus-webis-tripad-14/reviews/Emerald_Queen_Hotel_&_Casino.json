The guard, his superior, and their superior all demanded that we leave our devices in our car while we dined in their restaurant. This, in spite of the fact that they have signs posted all over their parking lots stating the dangers of theft of valuables in cars parked in their lots, valuables should not be left in cars, and they are not responsible for items that are.

After the concert we went to the club which had a good band to dance to. We went to catch the 2:30AM shuttle back and they said it had already left, so we ended up taking a cab that cost $13.
