Very central location as we were there for baseball spring training so we were right in the middle of all of the stadiums. Some things that were annoying about the hotel: slow Wi-Fi, super cold pool and super hot hot tub (so my kids couldn't use either), parking is very limited in front of the hotel (but there is free parking about a block away) and the topper was that we requested a crib for our little guy and they did not have one available. We stayed for 7 nights and finally got a crib the last 2 nights after talking to the manager on the 4th night (after asking at the front desk every day). We travel quite often and I've never requested a crib and not gotten one. There was nothing terribly wrong with this hotel but since we have a young family that wants to use a pool and a crib, I will find a different hotel the next time we are in Phoenix.", "title": "Nice room, some annoyances", "user": "HMTY", "date": "March 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125993110}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled with family", "text": "I have stayed at this hotel three times in the last 3 months.
