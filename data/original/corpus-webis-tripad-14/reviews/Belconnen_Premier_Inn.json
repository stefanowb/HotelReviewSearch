I was travelling with my 8yo son and on both nights we found the other guests noisy to the point of being rowdy late at night. Another reviewer has written that this is a 'home away from home' for public servants travelling for work - frankly, most of them are young and they treat the place as if they own it. On Thursday we arrived at around 10.30pm exhausted after a long drive to find people talking loudly in the corridors. On Friday, although the Inn is advertised as having a restaurant, a note was slipped under all doors advising that due to a private function the restaurant would be closed that evening. Luckily, having read that the restaurant wasn't the best anyway and that there are few places nearby to eat, we had already booked to eat at the Alto on Black Mountain. We returned and tried to sleep at around 10pm only to find that guests from the function were continuing to party loudly in the corridors. Reception closes at 11pm, so I went out and spoke to guests myself. Then from the room above ours a series of sharp, loud bangs resounded at 11.30pm and after about twenty of these I went up in my pyjamas to enquire. On my way up another guest told me these noises had been emanating from Room 247 for the past several nights. The man in Room 247 said he'd been putting something together and was now finished, thankyou - and closed the door on me.... Unbelievable. On the off chance you don't have to deal with noisy office workers in the corridors, there's the fact that breakfast is uninpsiring - $14.50 for a cooked breakfast and $19.50 for 'full breakfast' including continental, but muesli isn't offered and coffee isn't included - it must be paid for separately at $3 a cup. The beds are fairly hard, the doona was unclad and uncomfortably rustly, the bedside tables were cheap plastic office furniture. The room was small. The absolute best thing I can say about the place is that the shower was good and the staff were uniformly charming and pleasant - but it doesn't make up for the shortfalls. Do yourself a favour if you're a member fo the travelling public and leave this place to its regular clientele.", "title": "If you wouldn't stay at a pub then don't stay here...", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Thomidog", "date": "October 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 82401336}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we arrived, having booked a resonably nice room for a fairly high price, we discovered that the bed that looks like a king size is actually two single beds pushed up together.

I was served my coke with, not a long straw, but two short straws stuck together. Little details like this really let you know the calibre of the place you're staying. After waiting nearly an hour for our food and being told that because there was a big table being served before us (of 8 people) we should have expected to wait that long. I accept that this is a reasonable waiting period for a high end restaurant, but not at an over-priced isolated hotel eatery. We refused to pay for the meal (except for the coke and \"garlic bread\" - which I am convinced was just stale bread lathered in vegetable oil) and the two very unproffessional wait staff arranged for it to be charged to our room despite our complaints. The food we DID eat was dismal, the service was similar to what you'd expect at a sizzlers and there was very little choice in the meals available.", "title": "It's OK for business...but I wouldn't stay there for pleasure", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "flexitime23", "date": "June 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 67228538}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "We arrived the day before the Wedding Open Day and walked past the display room a few times while walking to and from our room.
