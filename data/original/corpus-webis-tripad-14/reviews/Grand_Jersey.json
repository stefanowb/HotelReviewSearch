The wines we had during our stay were quite exceptional. There is a comfortable lounge and a champagne bar. Breakfast was very good for carnivores. I only have one quibble and that is a common one with hotels outside South-East UK and that is the lack of understanding of herbal teas. I have been given green tea (which contains caffeine and is not herbal) and asked for Redbush tea to be given red berry tea - note to self take my own teabags!

From the moment we arrived until we left the staff were exceptional, the guys parking the cars, reception staff ( special mention to Marianne who was lovely & so helpful), restaurant & bar staff always very attentive, in fact everyone we came into contact with always had a friendly smile and greeting for you. Our room was spacious and well equipped and lovely and clean, we overlooked the park but also had a wonderful view of St Aubins bay. Lovely large bathroom with tropical rain shower head, lovely comfy bed, just perfect. Any bad reviews regarding rooms have just been unfortunate I think because ours was first class. We could not find fault with anything within the hotel anywhere, so clean. We used the pool, steam room and sauna everyday and this was really nice, we liked the low lighting as it set the mood for relaxation. We ate in Tassili on our first night (see separate review), ate out a couple of nights and then in Victorias on our last night (delicious meal). Breakfast buffet was very good, a large selection on offer but you could always get other things if you asked. The island is so beautiful and we will definitely be returning and would stay at the Grand. A big thank you to all the staff.", "title": "FANTASTIC ALL THE WAY", "user": "NorwichBella", "date": "October 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180793062}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the grand hotel for a weekend in September for my husbands 40th with our two girls.
