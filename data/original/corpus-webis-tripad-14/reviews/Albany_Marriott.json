Not the case with the Albany Marriot. I only stay there for one night and it's a good thing it wasn't any longer. Maybe I'm being to harsh. Let me put it this way, it a step above Motel 6. The carpet in my room seemed very dirty and it seemed way over priced for the area. There are a dozen or so hotels on Wolf St. really close to the airport. I would check others before I checked into Albany Marriot!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 10, 2005", "id": 3454920}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Typical Marriott", "text": "Typical Corp Traveler type of Marriott. Close to airport (sometimes I think too close). A little worn (carpets, coffee maker, etc). However generally in good shape. Only Issue I had/have is with airplane noise - its quite close the glide path for the airport and if the wind is running west to east (typically it is) the planes approach very close to the hotel - if you are a light sleeper, request a lower floor facing north. There are many properties to choose from the airport area not that there are any hilton/sheraton/hyatts - and the Marriott is much better than the Courtyard across the street.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JimBr0wn", "date": "March 17, 2005", "id": 3279722}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2004", "text": "We stayed here one night in September.
