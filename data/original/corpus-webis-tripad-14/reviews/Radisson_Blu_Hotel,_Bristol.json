We took the opportunity to do some Christmas shopping and the hotel is well positioned for shopping at Cabot Circus. All four of us were very impressed with this hotel on a number of fronts. Check in was fine and we were greeted with a complimentary glass of mulled wine which was very pleasant. Our rooms were lovely and we had good views of the harbour. We all thought the beds were very comfortable and had a good nights sleep, no noise at all. We decided to stay at the hotel for dinner as it was so cold outside and we were slightly nervous as hotel restaurants are so variable. We need not have worried as the service and food were very good. The breakfast was delicious and lots of choice. Other reviewers had commented on the food being luke warm and I have to say this was not the case for us, everything was piping hot. We would definitely come back to this hotel. I always check on tripadvisor before booking anywhere and I was impressed that the manager always responds to negative comments. We actually spoke to the manager as we were leaving the breakfast area and I am not surprised that this hotel is so good. Here you have a manager that cares about customers and does his utmost to make sure that everything is as it should be. The only slight negative comment would be that we were a little cold in the bar area during the evening but the manager said he was well aware of this problem and it was being looked into. If you are looking for a central hotel to stay in when visiting Bristol you would not be disappointed with the Radisson Blu", "title": "Great hotel", "user": "Gemima", "date": "December 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 147382479}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "I stayed here for one night recently.

Such bliss not to have to drive home, just walk across the road. Valet parking at \u00a323 a night is worth it for convenience and peace of mind.We walked to the SS Great Britain in less than twenty minutes. Buffet breakfast had plenty of choice and was of good quality. Room on the 13th floor had a splendid view over the city, though I agree that two lifts are insufficient for so tall a building. We asked for a twin bedded room, which turned out to be two beds pushed together, with one duvet. Room lighting was very poor (and my request for a replacement light bulb in one of lamps went unheeded). The room door spring sticks out, so you can only partly open the drawers in the clothes cupbard...unintelligent positioning. The bath mat offered as an extra should be in the room as standard... my husband slipped over twice. Staff in the restaurant didn't seem to be very organised....the Rapido service offered pre theatre was anything but.... the waitress spent a quarter of an hour talking to two people who weren't even eating that night before giving us our menus and then the food took another 25 minutes to arrive. The following night the staff busied themselves and the chef took our order personally, so I guess someone had had words. And the food was good. We'd stay again (but bring our own desk light).", "title": "Theatre package stay", "user": "Angela D", "date": "December 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 146544255}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Had a really nice one night stay at the Radisson Blu.
