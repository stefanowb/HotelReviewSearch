A theme park, theatre, shopping, indoor pool and restaurant are all onsite. Very few hotels can offer as many amenities. My wife and I, along with our pre-school son, purchased the \"Family Fun\" package, which included a family pass to Crystal Palace Amusement Park and a credit to the onsite restaurant, McInnis Landing. The front desk staff was very nice and interacted with small talk. The lobby area was a little tight with people checking in and out. We were assigned a room (California Suite) which gave us direct access to the indoor pool. The room featured two queen beds, mini-fridge, flat screen TV and many more standard features. Since we purchased the Family Fun package, the staff had placed two snack bags in our room. Rooms have complimentary wireless internet which provide a very good connect. The beds were very comfortable and clean; offering a pleasant night sleep. Overall, the hotel room was average\u2026 average in amenities and average in d\u00e9cor. A couple of items worth mentioning: there was a slight musty smell in the room, likely due to wet guest walking into the room from the pool. Also, we were awakening very early by the sounds of children in the pool so poolside room has its downside, especially at 8am. The hotel appears to be popular with hockey teams so expect to see plenty of teenage boys running through the hallways along with their parents sitting in rooms with the doors\u2019 open. We enjoyed our stay at Ramada Plaza Crystal Palace however if this hotel did not feature an onsite amusement park, it may not be as recommendable.", "title": "Great Location and Amenities But Still Average", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "StandingRoom", "date": "April 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 102573654}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a gift certificate for one of their fantasy suites that my wife bought at a fundraising auction.

It was never a hotel that was at the top of my list, but since staying there it's the first place I'd call in the future. Our room was absolutely beautiful, and the service at the front desk was beyond compare; those men and women are extremely friendly, helpful, and professional.

Oh, and did I mention that the front desk staff were excellent?

After a long afternoon/evening at the park we made our way back to our room so we could get cleaned up and head to bed. About half way through my shower I noticed that our bathroom had NOT been cleaned!!!! I wear glasses so I couldn't tell how bad it was until after. There were open shampoo and conditioner bottles from the person who stayed before us. Even a used bar of soap complete with body hair stuck to it. I let the hotel staff know the next day (our daughter was already in bed for the night) and they barely even apologized. After returning home I checked my credit card balance to find that I was OVER billed for this horrible experience. They charged me for the package that included the meal and then charged us for our meal again. I emailed the hotel with no response. I finally reached someone by phone who agreed to reverse the charge of the meal. Almost 2 weeks after leaving the hotel I checked my credit card again to find that I was still being pre-authorized for twice my hotel stay on my card. I had to call again to find out that they did something \"wrong\" with my card and it still wasn't fixed. At this point I was a little frustrated and called the Ramada toll free number. After several conversations I was assured that I would receive a complete refund from the hotel. Another 2 weeks later and still no refund. I phoned the Crystal Palace Hotel directly and was told that the chain toll free number never should have told me I'd receive a refund because the manager informed me that they \"don't do that type of thing\". She told me she'd email me a coupon for my next stay (not that I'd ever go back). I told her my email address but I never did receive anything. When I phoned back again I found out that the manager hadn't written down my email incorrectly. After spending five minutes trying to explain to the manager what an underscore was I finally gave up. I've still never received an email or an apology for that matter.
