On the good side: the whole place was spotlessly clean and brand new, the location very convenient and quiet, the rooms comfortable with good closet space, an armchair to read or watch TV, bed a bit too firm for me at first but I got used to it, the breakfast food was good with fruit, eggs, juice and toast, the staff friendly and serviceable, the reception staff was very responsive and competent, good free wi-fi, breakfast served on outdoor terrace. But for 165 USD for one person I expect flawless service and facilities, and that's not what it is. The most bothersome incident came during a power cut-- the back up generator sounded like a truck was in my bedroom (room number 4, probably close to it). By 11pm, I asked reception if they could stop the noise at some point--the temperature was very mild below 25 degrees celsius, and comfortable without AC. The night time reception manager refused to turn off the generator, because \"other customers need the electricity\"-- and he hoped the power would come back. Thankully, power did come back, sparing me a sleepless night. But at that price i expect clients sleep to be treated as a priority, at least between midnight and 6am-- even if it means using flashlights, waiting for various batteries to recharge etc. There were many other minor imperfections which to me are not a problem in themselves, my experience was still a very good one, but again I think not quite in line with the pricing. The bathroom is quite barebones, the bathtub plug was broken and i had to call the staff to empty dirty water, the only English language news on TV was Al Jazeera), the service at breakfast was understaffed one morning; breakfast got monotonous as the food was the same every day, contrary to every other hotel I stayed on the island (I would have liked to have a sausage /bacon option, yogurt and muesli option etc). In short, a nice stay, but i think there may be other places worth trying for better value. For instance the Seyyida hotel, where I once went for lunch, has a prime location right next to Sultan's palace, is brand new, and their rooms were 100USD for a single room/ 130 for a double. The only room they could show me as they were full was their \"family room\" -- very elegant and comfy. Also, the lunch food was excellent with a prime view from rooftop terrace.", "title": "Nice but overpriced", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ploumParis", "date": "July 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 115443416}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived in Stone Town and we were warmly greeted by the wonderful staff at Kisiwa House.", "title": "The best hotel in Stone Town", "user": "bezzzza", "date": "June 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114871782}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel is just off the main road, next to the other big hotels in Stone Town.
