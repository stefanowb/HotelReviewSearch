On check in staff were friendly informative and we were checked in promptly. The porter took our bags even though we had small cabin bags that we could have easily managed. The rooms are very modern and not everyones cup of tea as some people love traditional styles but it had all the facilities you could want. Breakfast was fantastic, proper decent laid tables, everything was served to a high standard with a great selection of top quality foods. What a pleasant change. We were also then given great advice on where to eat, 1st night an Italian called Gran Paradiso which was great, 2nd night we ate at the Gaucho Grill in Picadilly. Both excellent.
