Then came our departure date, December 18th 2010. We got the dreaded call that Saturday morning from British airways advising us that our flight was cancelled after the snow and bad weather hitting all of Europe. After hours waiting on the phone and spent on the Internet over a couple of days, tears of frustration and the heartbreak of our extremely well planned holiday flushed down the toilet and our X-Mas plans going to hell, we started looking for plan B. There was just no way possible of making it to Europe with all the airports being clogged up. We simply just couldn't make it. We asked the hotel for a refund and the answer was quite simple: not a chance. The answer was basically that I had booked and whatever happened with the weather wasn't their problem and they don't care and I lose my money. That's all. I tried, the amazing people at booking.com tried, I tried again asking for a response by hotel management and not just an answer from the clerk at the front desk and nothing. No one at \"management\" even bothered or had the decency to answer me. They simply just ignored my e-mails and didn\u2019t even take the time to answer. I also have to mention that we asked this place to give us a 4 night voucher as we are now planning our trip in July.
