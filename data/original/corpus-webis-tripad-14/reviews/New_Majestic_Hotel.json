Love it, especially the outdoor bathtub. Hence this yr, decided to be different and chose a junior loft lifestyle room. The room is small and the bed is located \"upstairs\" where i have to climb a small flight of stairs to get to it. Not exactly recommended for those bigger in size or having knee problems. The room is not as roomy as the premier garden. I didnt have the wow factor when i enter the room, since i was here the second time, probably i was expecting more. Nonetheless, the amenities were good. they even gave us two bottles of singapore sling as complimentary when they knew it's my friend's birthday. That was a nice touch. (: breakfast in the hotel was kinda disappointing. I would expect a more variety from a 4* boutique hotel and from my point of view, the hotel seems to be cutting cost. Not sure if it's true, just my two cents worth. Should u choose this hotel, do pick the premier garden room n above. Otherwise, you might be as disappointed as i am.", "title": "Junior lifestyle loft is suitable for small sized individual.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Powerpeach", "date": "June 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 114276336}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed the quirky details and excellent ammenities (coffeeeee) of New Majestic.

Of course there were excellent indoor shower/WC facilities as well. It's well located in Chinatown so you are spoiled for choice with so many eating places bars and nightclubs nearby, but why go past the top flight restaurant in the hotel. We sampled two rooms as we were able to use the 'shower room' facility after a day's shopping in steamy Singapore but before the flight out.
