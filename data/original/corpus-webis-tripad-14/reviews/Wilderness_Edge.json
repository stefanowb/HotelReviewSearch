Don't! The website was done by a real pro -- s/he made it look beautiful and comfortable. It is neither. The log lodges may be ok (I didn't see the interiors) but the \"rustic\" cabins are basically just shacks. 7 little shacks are crammed together in a treeless meadow. The one we stayed in looked like it was about to fall down. About 1/4 of the floor space was taken up by a wood cooking stove. All the electrical wiring was just stapled to the shack walls. The bed was so bad we took the mattress off and put it on the floor just so we could sleep. The bathhouse was ok, except that the water was off for 1/2 the time we were there. We thought we had found a bargain ($60/night) but all we found was a dump!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "jbullock47", "date": "July 29, 2006", "id": 5525183}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Cameron"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 2, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 14}, "aka": "Wilderness Edge Montana/Cameron", "slim_ranking": 0.25, "description": "Secluded solitude close to West Yellowstone and Yellowstone National park"}
