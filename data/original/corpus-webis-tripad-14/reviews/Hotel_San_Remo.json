We stayed in 3 rooms: 2 doubles and 1 triple. We arrived in Rome at the Termini Rail Station and the hotel was a short walk and very easy to find. The area immediately around the station was a bit seedy, but the nearer we got to the hotel, the better the surroundings looked. The lobby was fairly old fashioned but was clean. We arrived several hours ahead of check in. The man at the desk was accommodating and we were in our rooms in about 20 minutes. There is a small, slow lift, but we were very happy to have it available to us. The rooms all had new laminate flooring. The double rooms had very dated furniture and the mirrors on the armoires were cracked. Drawer pulls were missing but the rooms were clean. There was a faint cigarette smell in one room, but an open window took care of that quickly. The baths were also clean, but the tubs were not in great shape and the bathrooms could use an update. The hairdryers needed replacing. The triple room was nicer than the doubles. It contained a small room with a twin bed, a larger room with two twins and a much larger bath than the double rooms contained. Hotel staff was pleasant, though English seemed to be somewhat of a problem. The breakfast service was adequate and the waiters were very nice. A variety of pastries, cereals, juices and yogurt were served. The desk person helped us arrange for a large van/cab to get us to Leonardo Da Vinci airport for an early morning flight. We would probably prefer another location in Rome next time. For a budget accommodation this hotel was fine.", "title": "Decent hotel and location", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "swatts1", "date": "January 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 6606835}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "++ Pleasant Hotel ++", "text": "We arrived at the San Remo on the 23rd Oct 2006 and stayed 2 nights leaving early on the 25th. We found that the hotel was a pleasant and friendly hotel in a quiet area (compared to the rest of Rome) with some good restaurants near by. It was somewhere which made a good base to come back to to rest our tired feet after a long day of walking and touring the many fabulous sites of Rome. All of the hotel staff spoke reasonable English and had no problems in understanding what we were saying to them. We got a nice double bed room on the 4th floor (room 401) which from a small balcony overlooked the front street. The room was basic but had everything you would want and was clean and in a good condition. (cleaned every morning by cleaners who always gave a cheery hello). Another benefit was that the room was air conditioned which made a nice change to the hot weather outside. The only downside was that the shower had very little power and was more of a dribble than a spray, but it got you cleaned. Oh and if you like to dry your hair with a hairdryer I would recommend you bring your own...", "helpfulness": 23, "user": "SanRemoSurvivor", "date": "October 29, 2006", "id": 6025568}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006", "text": "However apart from this the room was totally adequate and we were very happy with it.
