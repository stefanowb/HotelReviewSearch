Jose was very nice! The room was spacious, but not great. As other reviews said, it had tons of potential, but was rather empty. You would assume you would have some kind of dining table in a room with a kitchen. The TV is tiny! Noise at night was high, but expected and not a problem. Very nice location being right across from the beach and park. My biggest complaint would be the balcony. It was tiny, odd shaped, faced directly at a building, and was very dirty. There was a roof top of the restaurant or other first level building directly in sight off the balcony and it was full of trash. The carpet and linens were clean, but the carpet had a big hump in it across the room which was annoying.", "title": "Average overall", "user": "eib8034", "date": "November 18, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 21982022, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Tiny TV"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled on business", "text": "The room was not clean and looked like it needed an uplifting.", "title": "Not the Greatest", "user": "travelforbusandfun", "date": "November 17, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 21950170, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the friendly staff you tried to accomodate", "disliked": "\u2014 the cleanliness of the room, location of room, parking setup"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "One side of the room faced a building under construction and the other side of the room faced a blank wall.", "title": "The Strand....not so grand!!!", "user": "trip2nowhere", "date": "November 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 21909023, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Room cleanliness, lack of attention when issues arose."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The set up with the parking was horrible.

Location is fantastic as everything is on your doorstep and only a 15min walk from Lincoln where all the shops are. The room was huge and had a lovely small kitchen which was great for making our own breakfast, which we did everyday (after buying OJ, croissants and bagels). The pool, this is fantastic and it was very quiet, the views were fabulous and loungers and cabanas (only 2 of these) were always available - which may be due to the time of year however. Beware though if you don't like birds as a group of seagulls seem to do a fly-by and dip in the pool every 15 minutes or so to cool down! There is no bar at the poolside but drinks are available from the Atlantic bar downstairs and the pool attendant will go for you if required. The music is very loud (we had a room right at the front next to cafe Medi) especially Fri & Sat night (it was much better and went off earlier during the week). You won't notice this if you like to go out and party but if you usually go to bed at midnight or 1am then you will hear the constant music until 3am. I decided that I chose to stay there in the thick of it all so should expect music - otherwise, stay on Collins somewhere! Slept with earplugs and managed to get to sleep easily enough though. Miami beach is gorgeous and everyone is friendly and helpful so I cannot wait to go back - although maybe when the \u00a31 vs $ rate is better since everything was pretty pricey, especially when 18% service added as standard (we were $66 for 2 vodkas and 2 cocktails!).
