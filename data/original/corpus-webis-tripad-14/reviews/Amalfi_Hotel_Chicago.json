The manager's nightly reception is easily the worst I have witnessed in Chicago. I asked for a refrigerator and microwave which was added to my room at no cost. The fridge is barely large enough to hold a small bottle of milk at one setting - FREEZE! Try pouring frozen milk on your breakfast cereal in the morning. The hotel is conveniently located though and I may stay here again depending upon the prices of other local hotels.

The Amalfi is located one block north of the river and 3 blocks West. Donald Trump's new hotel tower is next door. A botique hotel, the Amalfi is not a part spot. No lobby bar, Starbucks or Ruth's Chris. However, all this is a 2 minute walk away. Baseball famed announcer Harry Cary's Restaurant is across the street. Great bar and steaks. Hotel rooom service actually comes from there. The happy hour is smal but quaint. It is in a converted room on the 6th floor. There are 2 types of beer and Amalfitinis; served in masse. Dont ask for an extra shot. The Amalfitinis are tasty but lacking in vodka. The light snacks are Italian (as is the bottle beer). The am breakfast is typically European; breads, jams, juices, etc. Hint...the hotel executive offices are located on the 4th floor; so...the breakfast on that floor is the last to be picked up. Each floor has its own breakfast at the elevator area. If you stay on the 3rd or lower floors, expect no view. We selected a corner room and paid $10 bucks extra per night.
