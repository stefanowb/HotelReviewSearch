The next room was slightly better but so small with miniature bed(more like large single) far too small for 2 adults. The toilet was cracked, room was boiling hot even with window open...lamps were stained and not fitted, the coloured throw on bed was filthy as was the headboard and curtains didn't shut properly.

I was abit nervous after reading some of the reviews but i can honestly say it is a great hotel in a great location,yes the rooms are abit ,but ours ( room 403 ) was lovely,with all the products,slippers,bathrobs etc,the towels n sheets seemed to be changed every day,it had an iron,trouser press and an hairdryer, honestly what more do you want ?. The lounge is lovely and yes the check in area is small but who cares !!. We had no problem being understood by any of the staff who in fact were very friendly n polite , It winds me up when i read some of the reviews complaining about silly petty things when there is really no cause for complaint,( rant over ) .The hotel is in a lovely area with two italian restaurants and pub nearby,can recommend them but stay clear of the Yorkshire Grey pub.Its only a 5min walk onto Oxford St and Regent St,you can walk to the theater area of London in about 15/20 mins infact we didnt use the tube or bus ,we walked everywhere n believe me we saw nearly everthing,nothing was to far out of reach from the hotel.
