You got a sense that it islarger than an average hotel, but doesn't feel like an apartment complex or dormitory like other hotels in its class. Instead, you feel like you're in a high-end condominium. Large rooms with plenty of thoughtful touches such as excellent beds (with fluffy pillows), baths and linens. Has an audio adapter on the radio. One drawback: sink/vanity area is not separate from the bed area (not too big of an issue) and not enough outlets in the bedroom area for a laptop, cellphone charger, and JBL ipod speakers. I don't care for Ft. Worth. However, if I were to come back I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "title": "Bright Spot in a Bad Trip", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "jayci", "date": "December 5, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 4163821}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "We have 2 young children, & have stayed at Homewood Suites before (in downtown Chicago).
