The staff couldn't do enough and were extremely friendly, we travelled with our 6 month year old baby and they were brilliant with him. Hotel rooms are larger than expected and cleaned daily. There wasn't a problem with the sunbeds and location is perfect for a nice stroll into town / beach. Far enough out of Las Americas but near enough to Playa La Vistas (best place to be in the area). Only problem with the hotel is that the long trouser rule in the restaurants for dinner is not advertised and I only had one pair (very annoying, but understandable) and the fresh water pool at that time of year was too cold (but allowed me to \"man up\" and do 30 lengths a day in an empty pool).

When we arrived at the hotel we were upgraded from full board to all inclusive which was good. Our room looked over the golf course which was lovely and despite the terrace being in the shade it kept the room cool as the air conditioning unit did not work properly. We did report this on our first morning but nothing was done about it. After attending the welcome meeting with Thomson we decided to book Loro Park and were assured by the Thomson Rep that the coach would take 1 hour and 15 minutes. The trip was expensive and cost \u00a3118 despite our child being free but as we had been told the coach would travel directly to the park unlike some of the cheaper trips, we decided to book. On the day of the trip we were told to be outside the hotel at 8.30am as the coach was due at 8.45am. The coach eventually turned up at 9.15am. Despite being told by the rep that the journey would take 1 hour and 15 minutes we were still picking up other people at 10.30am from hotels miles away from the resort. We eventually reached Loro Park at 11.40am and managed to get into the park after being deserted by the coach guide at 12 noon. This was despite being promised by the rep that we would fast track any queues as we had paid upfront at the hotel. We missed the first dolphin show at 11am and had to rush through 3 shows before 3pm. We took the decision to miss the Loro Park parrot show as there was not time and our child needed feeding, even this was a disaster as we had to queue for 45 minutes and pay 19.50 euros for 3 cold burgers and cold chips as there was not time for a sit down meal. The coach set off back to the hotel at 4.30pm and we arrived back at 6.45p,m. In total we had spent more time sat on a coach than we did in the park. Thi trip was not even half a day as the park did not close until 7pm. On our return we confronted the rep with many other guests and she promised to look into what had gone wrong and let us know by the following Friday. This did not happen and after contacting the 24/7 help line we were informed that the Rep was busy at the airport and they had not managed to find anything out. We were then advised to email Thomson on our return but were informed by automated service that this could take upto 28 days for a reply. We have travelled with Thomson before but have noticed a marked difference in quality of service since they joined with First Choice. On previous occasions the reps have gone out of their way to provide an excellent standard of customer service but we felt on this occasion the rep's attitude was to avoid the situation and do nothing. We were told that this had been a one off occurence but I have my doubts. The coach to take us back to the airport was also 30 minutes late , and was so full that I was unable to get 2 seats together and had to sit with my child on my lap for the entire journey, without a seat belt this was totally unnecessary and had happened because the rep had allowed other travellers travelling to other UK airports to travel on the coach after we had been told by another rep that we had to wait for the appropriate coach. This broke many health and safety laws and the rep even had the cheek to remind everyone that it was compulsory to wear seat belts on the coach if they were provided despite overbooking the seats. They also could not be bothered to apologise for being 30 minutes late which sums up the overall service. These experiences spolit what would have been a good holiday. One tip to pass on to other travellers would be that the safe in the room works off your key card so do not pay out any money, just follow the instructions on the front of the safe and you will save at least 20 euros.", "title": "Not what we expected", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "claret", "date": "May 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 106560503}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here for 10 days just before Easter. Booked with Thompson so unsuprisingly got a room facing the road which was a little disappointing. Plenty of room space but litte sound proofing so woken up most mornings about 7am by cleaning staff. Had to be on a sunbed by 7:30am or else all taken - sun didnt reach the pool area to about 9:30am so spent a few mornings shivering on rickerty loungers in semi darkness, too scared to move in case the eagle eyed pool guard removed my towels. Food Ok but gentlemen have to wear long trousers for the evening meal whilst women can wear just about anything and did. After paying for one round of drinks decided to upgrade to all inclusive at 15 Euros per person per day which I considerd to be good value.

The quality of food and cleanliness was top notch and we sampled everything from Sirloin Steaks, Carvery Lamb, Beef and Pork, Veal dishes to die for, Pasta, Pizza and Fish dishes including Hake, Sole, Calamari etc. We were AI and there was a good range of local wine, beer and sprits available without having to queue endlessly.
