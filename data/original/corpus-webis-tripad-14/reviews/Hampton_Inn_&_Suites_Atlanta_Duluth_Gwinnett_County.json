My colleague and I arrived on Saturday night about 7, took our luggage out of the rental car trunk, and the trunk refused to close, sticking straight up. We tried to shut it a number of times, then went into register and call the rental company. Ebony at the front desk told me to move it under the canopy for safety so she could see it on cctv. When I moved it she came out with the maintenance man and they looked at it while I was in an endless computer loop for emergency assistance with the rental. He poked at the latch with a screw driver, but she problem-solved, noticing that the gasket had pulled slightly away from the rim, pushed it back in and, Voila! the trunk closed. She went above and beyond. Otherwise the staff were friendly, rooms clean, breakfast ample.

There were cookies at the front desk most of the evening, although the cadre of teenage baseball players kept the staff busy trying to keep cookies stocked. The breakfast was better than most with plenty of protein options and a change in selection from one day to the next. I don't recommend the hard boiled eggs, but the other items were acceptable.
