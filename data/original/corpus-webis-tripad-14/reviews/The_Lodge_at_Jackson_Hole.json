The whole hotel was recently renovated and the rooms had a nice upscale lodge-y feel to them. The size of the rooms was not huge but the quality was nice. We had a king bed and I believe all rooms have pullout sofabeds in them. The desk was nice and brought us extra blankets for the sofabed since none were in the room. The hotel is located just outside of downtown Jackson, just a few minutes' drive and we never had trouble parking downtown. At the hotel, the front parking spaces usually filled up but we found space in the back, which wasn't a big deal. The breakfast included coffee, tea, juice, scrambled eggs (with meat and without), bland diced breakfast potatoes, fruit, toast/bagels, yogurt, cereals, oatmeal. The breakfast area was usually busy and crowded in the morning. The shower was huge and had a neat rotating head. We had 3 people in the room and, even though we clearly used the shampoo/conditioner, housekeeping did not replace them, which was pretty annoying at this price point. This hotel was not cheap whatsoever, but it seems all the Jackson hotels are pretty pricey. The pool was on the warm side and there's an indoor and outdoor hot tub, except when we were there, the outdoor one was cold(?). The hotel also has a laundry room. They claim to have a fitness room, but we couldn't find it, even though the property is small. 3 free computers also provided, which was convenient for checking in for flights. Hotel is about a 20-minute drive to the airport.", "title": "Nice stay at cute property", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "steptravel", "date": "July 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 133442182}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great sized room. comfortable bed.
