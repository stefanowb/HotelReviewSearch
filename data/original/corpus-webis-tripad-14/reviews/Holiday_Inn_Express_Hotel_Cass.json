We planned on sight seeing for the day until we could check into our hotel at 3... but after a long bus ride and a night of no sleep, we were cranky and miserable. We called the front desk to see if there was ANY way we might be able to check in around noon?-- they told us we could check in that moment, at 7am! They saved the day! we were greeted by VERY welcoming staff, were not charged extra for checking in early, and were told we could enjoy the buffet breakfast-- which was music to our ears, we were starving! We were expecting coffee, juice and bagels, the usual-- but the breakfast was absolutely amazing. Fresh fruit, omelettes, sausage and biscuits and gravy, hot cinnamon rolls, yogurt, anything and everything, with a large, pretty dining room with plenty of room to sit down and enjoy. We stayed on the 9th floor in a standard queen, it was right by the elevator but noise was never a problem. My boyfriend is a very big guy, but the small rooms were never a problem. They were comfy, clean, and a great place to relax after a long day of seeing the city, which was exactly what we needed. No, they are not luxury rooms. No, you should not bring the contents of your entire closet. If you're traveling with kids, I'm sure the double queen rooms would be just fine, unless you're planning on camping out in your hotel room all day. But with such a great location (we walked everywhere!! longest walk was 20 minutes, but we didn't mind, we just got to see even more of the city!) who wants to stay in their room all day? Overall, we had a great time. We had a comfy place to sleep in the heart of Chicago, with very friendly staff and yummy breakfast to start off our days of exploring.

The staff was fantastic, from the front desk, doormen, maintenance and the cleaning staff, all friendly, approachable and professions. We had a great time, and would definitely stay again. The beds were also great. The only annoyance, and a minor one at that, was the parking garage across the street.
