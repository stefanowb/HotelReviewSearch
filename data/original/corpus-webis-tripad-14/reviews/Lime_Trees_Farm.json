The room was very nicely appointed with tea making equipment and toiletries. The B&B is an old farmhouse with stables. Our room was in the roof, large with a large bathroom, however it was very cold when we arrived at 4.30pm and we had to ask the owner to put the heating on, even though she know we were arriving. We had to get into bed to keep warm as the heating was not adequate for the large room, and needed to be kept on for longer. The second day we had to ask for the heating to be put on again when we came back at 4pm.
