Grand Palladium, Lady Hamilton is just as beautiful in person!! The Resort is amazing, the food wonderful (I am sure we gained at least 10 lbs.) and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We used the sunset cove beach the most, and the jerk chicken hut was so handy....and delicious!! Our room was 3407 with 2 walk out verandahs, the one had a beautiful view of the water and gazebo. There was a bit of an issue with the shower, but once we realized it leaked....a lot... we put a towel at the bottom of the door, and there were no problems after that! Bubbas steakhouse was great, and so was the seafood restaurant. We missed our reservations at the Italian restaurant, as we were late coming back from our Dunne River falls trip (that bus ride was long!), but the buffets each night were wonderful and more than enough variety of food (something for everyone). We did the Chukka tours combo trip with the inner tubing and 6 ziplines, which was an amazing day....and well worth the $$!! The week went way too fast, but we had a great relaxing vacation! The resort is large, so there is lots to see (not sure we saw it all) there is a lot of walking, but after eating so much, that wasn't a problem either. The entertainment staff went over and above what they needed to, they must have extremely long days....and nights! Thanks Grand Palladium, Lady Hamilton for an amazing time!

We enjoyed the holiday, but this is definetely not a 5star hotel compared with similar hotels in other Caribbean resorts. The suite was ok and cleaned daily but we needed to have light bulbs replaced and the curtain rails fixed. The shower fitting was loose and continually slipped down but the bath was excellent. The rooms are in need of refurbishing as some floor tiles were cracked and the toilet was in a bit of a sorry state. There was no towel sculptures or extra little touches usually associated with 5* hotels. There was a good variety of food every day in the buffet and you could always get a steak cooked for you at the grill. My main criticism is that buffet food was often luke warm at best especially at breakfast. The al a carte restaurants were very good apart from the Indian where the service was very poor. We can highly recommend the tenderloin beef in the Italian, far better than the steak restaurant!! Sunset beach is by far the best beach as it is much easier to walk out and have a decent swim. The other beaches are quite rocky underfoot and definetely not suitable for children . In the bars the staff were nice and attentive but rarely had the ingredients needed for the cocktails. No mint for 3/4 days for mojitos; then no bananas for banana based cocktails. Piano bar kept running out of Baileys and in 2 weeks I never saw or heard the piano being played!!

It's amazing how no AC in 90 degree weather can ruin your trip. Could barely even sleep because I was covered in sweat... Cold showers weren't even relief enough..my husband spent our third night on a hammock on the beach...and that was the best nights sleep he got the entire time..it shouldn't be like that when you spend that amount of money..

It is truly a magnificent resort placed on the side of a mountain with gullies, serene type bay areas, coves and inlets. I am sure we have only seen 25% of this resort as we were spoiled where our Villa was. The architecture is beautiful. The resort is only 4 years old and very well kept. It is the hot moist weathered Caribbean so yes there is wear and tear on some things but if you are going to critique a cracked tile here and there the tropical areas are not for you stay home.

I had emailed them with my requests for rooms and in the order of importance. We had booked a 1 Bedroom suite and requested that the other room for our friends was either adjoining or next to us as her daughter was our Nanny for the week. I had asked that if possible are entire group be in the same building or close to each other. We ended up in Villa 26 room 2630 Oceanfront Suite with our Nanny being right next door in room 2629. The other two rooms were in Villa 28 right next door with Ocean view rooms also. Check in was a breeze, took about ten mins for 3 room check ins. We got there at noon and they were still working on them and our other party had not arrived yet. We went to lunch and came back at 1PM and all 4 rooms were ready. We asked for extra room keys right away so we could leave one in the wall and each person could have a key and it was not a problem. The Villa was right next to the Main areas pool, Lobby etc. fantastic location. The room was huge with a separate King Bedroom and Living area, pull out sofa all made up for our daughter, huge jet tub, huge shower, lots of counter space and 2 very large balconies. The views were amazing. We expected a musty smell and brought small candles but never needed them, we expected hard beds and hard pillows and were surprised at how comfy they all were and we are use to a Temperpedic Mattress. Our AC was wonderful and I woke up needing blankets several mornings. The housekeeper Paula was wonderful. Our room was cleaned twice a day, always had towels, nightly turn down service and our fridge was always restocked and even with extras. We tipped her 3 out of the 5 days only because I forgot the other two but gave her extra, still had great service all days. Out of all 4 rooms 2630, 2629, 2829 and 2827 there were no real complaints. The open air courtyards in the Villas were beautiful and we did not mind walking up to the third floor even with a stroller. We left it by the bottom of the stairs all day with our pool stuff in it and brought it up at night with no problems. Nothing was ever touched. The tree frogs and crickets were loud but we could not hear them in our room. We were right next to the theater and never heard any noise in our room. There was only one night when we were in bed at midnight and we fell asleep just fine, the other night 3 and 4 am. If you kept your balcony door open then yes I could see the problem but who would do that it is really hot and humid.", "title": "Nice property...bad INFECTION", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "skrana", "date": "October 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 143381951}], "location": {"country": "Caribbean"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 222, "average": 360, "very good": 849, "terrible": 129, "excellent": 989}, "aka": "Grand Palladium Lady Hamilton Hotel Lucea", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "description": "The resort is bathed by the calm turquoise waters of Jamaica's north coast, in a small bay on a privileged enclave on the coast.
