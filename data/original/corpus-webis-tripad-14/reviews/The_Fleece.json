Although we had a terrible journey in appalling weather, the welcome we received made the trip worthwhile. The staff are all relatively young, with bags of enthusiasm which makes a nice change. Our room was at the front of the hotel and, although quite contemporary, could do with a coat of paint to freshen it up. This applies to the whole hotel which is very clean and well-decorated, but could do with a touch-up here and there. Not a criticism, but an observation. We had lunch in the bar which was a very good standard and equaled many restaurants for quality and innovation. Parking was a bit iffy as there was a function in the private dining room meaning the the car park was full, but I'm sure this was a one-off. Breakfast was good and freshly cooked. For the price of \u00a390 per room I think it represents excellent value for the Cotswolds and we would heartily recommend to anyone who enjoys good food and service", "title": "Exceptional - apart from the bed!", "user": "Getaway19", "date": "April 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 27868451}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "Six of us stayed for a Saturday night in late November and really liked this place. It's more gastropub than spit and sawdust pub with interesting wallpaper, comfortable seating and convivial ambience. Service was friendly and attentive and we were offered mulled wine on checking in and when one of our party complained that there was no hairdryer or bath towels in their room we were later offered a round of drinks or reduction on the bill, which we thought was really good service - it was done in a friendly way and much appreciated. The bed was comfy with thick duvet, White Company cushions and throws and toiletries. The full english breakfast included in the \u00a390 room rate was excellent in our opinion - they use good quality ingredients and cook them well.
