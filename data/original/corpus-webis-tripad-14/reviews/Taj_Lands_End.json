The hotel's location is great - 30 minutes from domestic airport, right around the corner from the Sea Link to Southern Mumbai and an auto ride away from great shops and restaurants in Bandra/Juhu/Khar (Auto and taxi drivers all use the meter and do not overcharge). We thoroughly enjoyed the view of the Arabian sea from the 16th floor. But I was disappointed by the impersonal service. It seems like there are as many employees as guests in the hotel, yet you never really get the sense that any staff cares about you and your stay personally. I had a rate with an upgrade based upon availability, but an upgrade was not offered (though I heard from other staff that the hotel was not full). I had put a special request in with my reservation as this stay was special, but this was not referred to at all. I've really had far better and more nuanced service in other 5 star hotels in India - small things like being greeted by your name by the manager on duty, welcome drink/fruit basket in the room, etc. Also, please note that there was no mention on the hotel website that the gym and spa were undergoing renovations and had been temporarily moved to emptied-out guest rooms on the 11th floor. Rooms are not very sound-proof: you can here the people next to your room opening their door and if the people above you are in a party mood forget sleep for the night. Lastly, no explanation at check-in or reference in the directory on wifi rates (yes, the hotel charges).", "title": "Great location, sublime view, impersonal service", "user": "yatrika40", "date": "January 11, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 122917981}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled with family", "text": "This hotel is in a decent location in Bandra, has nice amenities and rooms.

If you need to move between south Mumbai and bandra, santacruz, etc., this is by far the most convenient location as it's right off the sealink and the highway. Traffic is a nightmare in this city so be very careful of where you put up as it can make a huge difference. The hotel itself lives up to the legendary Taj hospitality. I've stayed at the Lands End and also the 4 Seasons, which are on either side of the sealink. While the rooms at the 4 Seasons are bigger, the Taj get's my vote based on the quality of the rooms, service, and location. The upgrade to the club level rooms are well worth it, and the only way to go. You get a separate lounge, which is very convenient to have business meetings, the rooms themselves are modern and upgraded, breakfast and tea in the afternoon is included, and you also get complimentary use of the conference room for 2 hrs.
