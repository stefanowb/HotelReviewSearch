The Grand Hotel Mediterraneo has a wonderful view over the famous river Arno banks (called \"Lungarni\"), near the beautiful Piazza Santa Croce, with a stunning panorama of the city Renaissance beauties along the river Arno and on the Florentine hills. Whether you are staying in Florence for work or for a sightseeing tour, you will find the warmth of the typical Florentine hospitality, in a modern and comfortable setting. The hotel position is ideal for its closeness to the city historical centre. The Grand Hotel Mediterraneo is very close to the most important monuments, including Piazza Santa Croce, Piazzale Michelangelo, the Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio.

The bathroom was even smaller with a shower so small that you could not even turn around in it. It was almost impossible to sit on the toilet which was wedged between the wall and the shower without hitting your arm on the toilet paper hanger. It certainly did not look like the pictures that were posted. It was also exceedingly noisy as many tour groups are booked here, especially teens. Carpets and room decor need some renovation. Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Location was a good walk from everything. The worst part however was the indifference of the front desk. Good luck if you have a real problem.
