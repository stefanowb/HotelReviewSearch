Nothing was too much trouble and the food was excellent - all very obviously top quality ingredients and home made!! No children's menu - but all adults meals could be scaled down - even going so far as to halve their puddings so that the kids could share. We were staying elsewhere so can't comment on the accommodation - but really can not praise the food and service highly enough. Bar very friendly too - felt like more of a locals pub but we were made to feel very welcome (children included). Is located a little bit further off the beaten track than many other pubs but well worth the short walk.
