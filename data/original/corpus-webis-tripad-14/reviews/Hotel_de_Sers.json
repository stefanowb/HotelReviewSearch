How wrong we were! Blatant lying after given the wrong room type was the main of many issues from this establishment. Only when we gave them eveidence from the room itself did they actually move us to the corect catogory. (they put us in a \"superiour\" room not the \"delux room\" as we had paid for) It was an uphill battle for them to admit that they had made a mistake and finally we were told that we could move to another room the following day. Take note that the room was small, no plazma TV as expected as per the website, the wrong incorrect meal, the wrong wine supplied, all with exceptional price tags (even for Paris) with no way of opening the bottle via room service.When the compaint was made with all the above, they didn't appear to be too concerned, moved us to the correct room catergory but made out that they were doing us the favour! Extremely disappointing to say the least, we were totally frustrated by their actions. We travel frequently world wide and always book a minimum of 4 star.
