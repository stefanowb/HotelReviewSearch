It is not even in the same league as its sister Taj property (Gateway Hotel), which is at the lower end of the Taj chain. This hotel is a beautiful guest house, gorgeously furnished and beautifully maintained. There is an extremely attractive swimming pool, which I had to myself each time I used it. The staff aims to please but is never intrusive. There are no rules here--the staff advises you that it is \"your house\" and they will accommodate you as to any request. The hotel is certainly in stark contrast to the energy of Varanasi.
