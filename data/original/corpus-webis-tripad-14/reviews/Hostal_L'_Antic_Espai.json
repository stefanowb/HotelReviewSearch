There is a Metro stop approximately two blocks away and many historical sites and museums are within walking distance. 3) Price - In comparing prices to neighboring hotels, the price per night (for a triple bed) totalled approximately 144 (USD) 14, whereas other hotels charged as much as 400+ per night. The staff namely Sergio, Felipe, and Abel were extremely helpful and on numerous occasions went out of their way to feel guests feel welcomed. I personally goofed on our reservations a few times, which caused them to make several changes to our reservations and during each correspondence they warmly made my changes. The rooms are fashionably decorated (much like the staff) and offer a warm welcome. The terrace is a good spot to enjoy the weather while reading a book.
