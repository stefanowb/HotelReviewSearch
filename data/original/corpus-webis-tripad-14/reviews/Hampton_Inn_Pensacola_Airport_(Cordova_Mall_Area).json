We were a little hesitant because it's right at the entrance to the airport, but we heard maybe three or four planes while we were there. (The flight pattern must be in the other direction.) Upon check-in, we were upgraded from a room to a suite - which was a pleasant surprise. Everything was in tip-top shape, and we had the very sufficient complimentary breakfast every morning. A newspaper was delivered outside our door each morning, too. In our opinion, the rate was very reasonable - especially considering that we stayed in a suite, not just a room. This location is perfect - within a couple of blocks of shopping and dining, about 10 minutes from Downtown, about 20 minutes from the beach, and right at the airport (if that's something you would need to use). The hotel personnel were very courteous and friendly. If I had to list one inconvenience, it would be that the elevators are all the way at the back of the hotel, and our suite was all the way at the front of the hotel when we got off the elevator!
