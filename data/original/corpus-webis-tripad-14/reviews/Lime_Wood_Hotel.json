A special mention goes to Noemie who delightfully looked after us during our lunch. The setting is superb and the stylish design is both understated and stunning at the same time.

The whole ambience is \"relaxed\". On arrival, the reception staff made our guests very welcome and showed them to the bar where we were having drinks. We couldn't have asked for better attention. Everyone felt so comfortable and the experience extended to the meal itself. We were in a side room, off the main dining room, with views out to the Forest. What a great stress-buster for the busy executives who were attending. The meal itself was served unobtrusively by Daniel and his staff and the attendees were able to talk around the table without interruption.

Lovely large room. The design throughout the hotel is inspired and the spa was one of the best I've been to. The food in both the scullery and dining room was very nice, the sommelier in particular was very good and the staff all very nice. There were a few issues; I have never stayed in a place where the domestic staff interfered with belongings so much in a room by tidying them away. I had to leave them a note to ask them to leave things were they were. The bicycles need some attention. There was a very uncomfortable 13 mile ride on a seat that kept tipping upwards.

My husband and I went to celebrate our anniversary with 2 nights to ourselves while our daughter was looked after by her grandparents. Granted, the sheer joy of being child free for a while and able to properly relax meant we would have enjoyed ourselves almost anywhere, but still Limewood was impressive and just the tonic we needed. Our 'Generous' room was beautifully appointed and very comfortable with a balcony looking out over the Forest. Welcome was friendly and just the right side of informal. There was a complimentary bottle of champagne in the room to congratulate us, which we were impressed with as I didn't even remember telling them when booking why we were there. Drinks in the bar were a joy and dinner in the Scullery on the first night was very enjoyable. Once again at the end of the meal we were bought a plate of petit fours one a plate piped with 'Congratulations' - really thoughtful. Limewood is so conducive to relaxation I defy anyone not to chill out while there - breakfasts in our room were fabulous, we took one of their walks through the New Forest and the only other living thing we met were wild horses, the spa treatments we had were divine (I feel asleep during my facial and reflexology), the outdoor spa pool is fabulous (we spent over an hour in there late afternoon with close to 0 degrees temperatures outside - the only thing missing here is the ability to order a glass of fizz while you wallow!!), the pool was lovely and almost empty, and the indoor hydrotherapy areas were great fun (and we had them to ourselves).

We like to think of ourselves as a luxury country house hotel with a difference. We've used Lime Wood's classical structure as the basis of our design but we've lovingly renovated it with a fresh approach, reviving its architecture and grounds. We've kept the spirit of its past, taken inspiration from its extraordinarily beautiful surroundings and added the odd contemporary twist to bring it to life. The food is by Luke Holder and Angela Hartnett. With its proximity to London, our New Forest boutique hotel really is the ultimate countryside getaway; perfect for weekend breaks, a dash from the city, or an escape from home; whatever your motivations, we can't wait to show you around."}
