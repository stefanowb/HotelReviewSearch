We ended up stopping in Tannerville and pretty much didnt see any motels when we arrived except for the big Great Wolf Lodge sign. Keep in mind this was July the 4th but it was 6ish pm so we thought we would give it a try and see what the rate was....well they still wanted 450 for a room for one night for the 4 of us so I passed....our daughters were abit miffed at us but oh well ! We ended up driving back up the mountain side because we could see a days inn sign....went in, it was 54 a night which was super cheap so we took it....rooms were clean but dated. I tried to talk to the man at the front desk to see where we could go eat or shop and by eat I wanted a red lobster or steakhouse......he sent us to the outlet mall which had a food court. When we found this we asked a man standing in the parking lot where we could find a steakhouse....he said go back to the big tannerville sign and go straight....we had come down the hill and turned left...to head to the outlet mall but never did turn right to see what was there.....well we found a red lobster....lots of shopping, a kohls....we had a great night but kinda wished we would of stayed down in this area. That night there were fireworks and because we were in the side of the mountain we could see them but I feel this hotel needs some tlc for me to return.", "title": "one night stay on our way into NYC....", "user": "candle_maker_2004", "date": "January 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 150876107}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed in the Jacuzzi Suite and were pleasantly surprised by how clean it was.

It says free continental breakfast. Well they are definitely saving money on their end cause no one was eating it. There was nothing wrong with it wuality wise jus quantity. You had a handful of options an that was it. 2 cereals, bagels, coffee, breakfast bar,bagel, an a couple mini doughnuts. Im from the south and our continental breakfasts are stacked.

The rooms were nice and clean. Kudos to Housekeeping for doing a great job. The hotel was quiet at night. Front Desk staff was very nice and friendly. When we needed a shovel to dig our car out, somebody was always there to help. I definitely recommend the Indian restaurant on premises. The food was excellent. There is something for everyone on the menu. We kept coming back every night. If I could suggest one area for improvement, it would be breakfast.

After reading some reviews I was pretty nervous about what we may find boy was I surprised!! We stayed in a jucuzzi king room number 141.. The hotel is very easy to find we checked in late and it was simple... Room was clean and tub was great!! Heat worked perfect no smell or nasty things in the room at all... My wife and I are very picky about rooms and rarely pay full price if our experience was not satisfactory... Needless to say we payed full price.. Our tv remote didn't work when we arrived we told them the next morning and by the time we came back we had a new remote... We also forgot our wine quorker and the bar staff opened our bottles with no problems.... Great stay and even better value.!!! I would stay here again in fact we are planning a stay in the spring!!! No it's not the ritz... But if you are expecting that for the price go elsewhere...

I actually wrote a review before but they must have gotten the site to delete it, which shows they must have been worried about the truth behind my first review. The room was dirty - there were an old pair of boxers found in the corner, there were two cigarette burns in the felty type yellow sheet in the one bed, brown hair strands in the bathroom, and holes at the bottom of the wall towards the entrance of the bathroom. I posted pictures with the last post that was deleted of the evidence. Maybe when you stay you will get a better room then we did..but we will not be returning. We complained to staff but they did not offer a discount or a deal for a room in the future. We tried to stay somewhere else but every hotel nearby was booked around the holiday.
