Sure, the pool and lobby are nicer than most; sure, the Bricktown location is convenient, sure, the workers greet you as if you were their best friend, but that doesn't make this more than another Hampton Inn in a long line of Hampton Inns. It's an OK place if you like generic, but five starts it isn't. Stay here; it's fine.

Check in was easy, we reserved a one bedroom suite for my husband and I and our 2 year old daughter. We were suprised that it was actually more of a 2 bedroom suite. We had two beds, two baths and a little kitchenette area. I'm not sure if we were upgraded or that's normal but it was great. Our daughter was able to nap and sleep in her own room and we weren't worried about bothering her. The room was very clean. My small complaint was that the mini fridge did not have a freezer. We were hoping to refreeze our ice packs. The breakfast was good: waffles, eggs, cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc. The cool pool for our daughter was a huge hit. She didn't want to leave. It was a perfect set up for her and there was a seperated area for the big kids. It was perfect. Our bigger disappointment was in Bricktown. I thought there would be more shopping and it was mainly nightlife and restaurants. That was fine just not what I expected. The rooms were fairly quiet. I could hear our upstairs neighbors a little but nothing too bad. You're going to get that in any hotel.

Lots of places to go within a couple of hundred feet of the hotel to eat and drink. Tap Workz had some superior beer on tap. Excellent indoor water park for the kids. Not a place to swim laps in, but to play in the water.......The area had a lot of police patrolling at all hours. Felt safe walking around Bricktown, even at night.

This one is located in a fun & exciting area of OKC and the price reflects that. However, do not stay on the top floor, in particular room 913. I am a deep sleeper but was awakened at 2am by a loud buzz. I called down to the front desk and was told it was a rooftop generator and the noise would only last 10 minutes. After 15 minutes of buzzing, I called the front desk again and upon request, we were relocated to the 2nd floor and a new room key was delivered to us. At that point, I'm glad the staff was quick to respond to my request, but it was unpleasant to be awakened by such a disturbing noise and inconvenient to get up in the middle of the night, gather our bags and move ourselves into another room. The next day the room charge was comped after I brought it up with management during check-out. I hope in the future that that room is not given to other guests or if/when it is, it is deeply discounted and guests forewarned about the noise issue. Also I am not sure if that noise affects only room 913 or the entire 9th floor but I'd recommend staying on the lower floors just to be safe.
