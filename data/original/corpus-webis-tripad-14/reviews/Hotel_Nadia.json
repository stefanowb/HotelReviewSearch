The rooms are not big but then if like us, you just want a base from which to explore this beautiful city, it is perfect. Our room had a TV, fridge, tea/coffee, shower, wc, safe and comfy bed. What more can you ask for ! The staff are all very friendly and helpful. It was my boyfriend's birthday during our stay and when we got back to the room on the afternoon of his birthday, there was a beautiful bouquet of flowers whishing him a Happy Birthday ! You don't get that sort of customer service very often !! We were really impressed. We checked out on the last day and the hotel kindly stored our luggage until late afternoon. Some guests have commented that the stairs are steep, I think there are about 37 up to main reception, but if you are fit and able, this is not a problem. Lets face it, with all the lovely food you will be eating in Dam, then a bit of exercise is a good thing !!

After a flight from Moscow, a train ride, a tram ride, a short walk with a ton of luggage, I was pretty upset to see a dingy door leading to two flights of VERY steep and narrow staircase. No elevator. I was not happy (but very polite). Well, there was help. A small man told us we didn't have to worry about bringing our luggage up the stairs and that our luggage would be delivered to our room. OK, I'll buy that. After climbing the stairs we entered a very small and depressing receiving area - the front desk so to speak. Still not happy (and still polite-I do have manners). The man behind the desk took total control of the situation, offered us soda's and told us to wait in the breakfast room while our luggage was being brought up and our room was made ready. We headed down a poorly lit hallway with metal room doors on either side. Still not happy and wondering what we got ourselves into. We took a right and entered the breakfast room. Instant happiness! The room was everything you would want in an old European hotel. The room was small but very well decorated and cozy. There were large and beautiful windows and a door leading to a small balcony. I'm happy now. Anyway, the man told us our room was ready and gave us our key. We walked up two more flights of, again, VERY steep stairs. As we entered our room we were so very happy. It was the top corner room overlooking the canal and church. A door entered onto a small balcony and a set of half-moon windows opened to the canal and church. The room was extremely clean and efficient. High ceilings and everything you could possibly need to make your stay comfortable. The bed was very comfy. In the morning we returned to the breakfast room for the complimentary breakfast. The best croissants, jam, coffee, and juice. Again, very nice. The hotel is located near the Anne Frank house on a canal. I recommend this hotel ONLY if you want to brave the stairs. There is no elevator so you need to be able to climb the stairs. The staff at the hotel is far above average. So - excellent staff, great location, cool room, very clean.

Since it was our first trip to Amerstedam, it was a little bit of a challenge figuring out the routine for getting to the hotel via train and tram, but not bad. The 2nd time would be a piece of cake. We ended up getting off the tram too early and dragging our overstuffed luggage a couple of extra blocks to the hotel. We were pretty tired when we arrived at the front entrance. Then -- when the door opened there was an almost vertical narrow staircase descending into the heavens and no lift. We quickly overcame our initial reaction, however.
