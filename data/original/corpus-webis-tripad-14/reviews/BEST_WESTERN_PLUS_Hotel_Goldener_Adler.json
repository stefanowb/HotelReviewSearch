The hotel looked after our bags during that trip which was a huge help. Every member of reception staff were so friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to deluxe rooms - 102 and 104. What an unexpected treat. But I am sure all the rooms are very good. The hotel has real history and is bang in the middle of the old town. Our dinner outside was a great setting, but the service and food quality didn't match - I guess it's mass tourist catering and we should have known that. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. But perhaps have your evening meal elsewhere, or just don't have high expectations on that score.
