Paris is my favourite city in the world and we travel here regularly each year but this was my first time at this lovely venue and we were not disappointed in any way. Our lovely room on the fifth floor facing the courtyard was quiet as requested with a beautiful spacious marble bathroom with excellent fixtures and fittings, a good power shower and good quality toiletries. I have to admit the room itself was slightly smaller than the one I had been expecting because I like the room to be approached by a small hallway as shown on the internet but we had an exceptionally good deal from Expedia and the hotel was unusually busy for August. However, in retrospect we were very happy there and because it was so quiet will probably request the same room on our next visit. I have been disappointed to read complaints but obviously the Plaza Athenae, Bristol or Ritz would be happy to accommodate those who can afford a more upmarket venue for five to seven days. In Europe I find if you don't like your room or have problems and you are as polite and courteous as the Europeans they are usually happy to do their best for you wherever you are whether its changing a table in a restaurant or a particular hotel room. On arrival the black and white tiled floor, velvet sofas, chandeliers, stained glass windows and the general glamour and style of the hotel creates a lovely and welcoming ambience. I adored the jazz bar with its fabulous 20's style, red velvet drapes, sofas, and amazing black statue dividing the piano area from the seating and have to say I could have been there every night quite happily and between the two restaurants perhaps never have left the hotel!! I too again enjoyed the Brasserie Lutetia which I had been to previously - in fact we had a kir royale and a delicious lobster salad there for our last luncheon. I look forward to \"Le Paris\" the major restaurant but sadly it was closed in August. Because of our long lunches we did not visit the breakfast room for the buffet but I have no doubt the standard would be also excellent. The \"Lutetia\" ofcourse diagonally faces a lovely little park and leads to my favourite department store Bon Marche and is very close to the beloved people watching \"Les Deux Magots\" which I love. The metro Sevres Babylon takes you anywhere you want to go all over Paris with trains flying in every two minutes. My birthday was celebrated at \"La Grande Cascade\" a beautiful palace restaurant set in the beautiful Bois du Boulogne, would have been in the gardens but on a duller day I was more than happy to enjoy the opulence, magnificent cuisine and splendid service of the interior. Another lovely lunch was at the gorgeous brasserie \"Montparnasse 1900\" with its delicious and very affordable set menu and stunning mirrored and belle epoque fixtures and fittings. Musee des Arts Decoratifs has now been fully renovated and a wonderful experience with lunch at the new modern restaurant \"Le Saut du Loup\". Also went to some lovely exhibitions but just walking the streets of Paris and along the River Seine is an unforgettable treat in itself. Staying at \"Hotel Lutetia\" was a beautiful experience for us and we look forward to our return and hope everyone enjoys it as much as we do.

The bath area was rather drab and felt like it had not been cleaned properly. Our converter and adapter did not work nor did the two different ones the hotel sent to our room. This resulted in two rather expensive pieces of travel equipment being ruined. My cell phone was taken from our room and the management was totally unconcerned and of no help in trying to determine who had taken it. (The door was locked and only their staff had access to the room.) We were in a Superior room at E400+ per night, so I shiver to think of what the lesser priced rooms were like.

I was VERY concerned about previous ratings and this is the first time I have written in a review. I would like to say that the negative comments were completely unfounded. The rooms were fine. Unfortunately, we could not upgrade to a suite or a room with a view, because most of the rooms in the city were taken up by the World Cup Rugby finals. It didn't matter. The bathroom was large and new, the room was a nice size and quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. There was no \"smokiness\" which had been previously reported and the service was fine. I have only two complaints about the room. The drawers were old and hard to open and the television/movies did not work, despite repeated phone calls to the front desk. Other than these two relatively minor issues everything else was great. The buffet breakfast each morning was excellent. The concierges and front desk personnel were extremely helpful, courteous, and had no issues with our inability to speak French.
