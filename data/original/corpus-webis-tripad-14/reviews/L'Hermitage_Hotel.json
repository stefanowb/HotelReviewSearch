We were going on a quick get away to the city and after reading the reviews on trip advisor decided to book at L'Hermitage. The customer service is top notch. Starting at the front desk and with every other employee in between. There is some construction going on accross the street so it can be a bit noisy in the morning if your not up early. Didn't bother us though. The room is beautiful we stayed in a suite and the breakfast in the morning was delicious too.Wonderful patio on the 5th floor where we had a glass of Its walking distance to all downtown attractions and the front desk recommended some great places as well.
