Upon our return we checked into a one bedroom suite on an upper floor. The rooms were large, more like an apartment than a NYC hotel. We had a separate bedroom with a tv in a large armoire, a full bath off the bedroom with bathtub and excellent water pressure, a living room with another tv and comfortable pull out sofa bed, and a full kitchen with full size refrigerator, range, microwave, toaster and all kitchen utensils. Our rooms were very clean, although a little beaten up (there was some peeling wallpaper on one of the walls and the edges of the sofa were a little ratty). Two minor concerns, neither of which affected our enjoyment of the room or the hotel,. A person sleeping in the living room on the sofa bed would need to go into the bedroom to use the bathroom. Also, there were no dressers or clothing storage areas in the living room except for a closet to hang clothes and that foldable rack to hold an open suitcase.", "user": "irish_lass1", "date": "August 1, 2005", "id": 3727682}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great stay", "text": "This hotel was the perfect haven during our hectic week-long tourist break in New York.
