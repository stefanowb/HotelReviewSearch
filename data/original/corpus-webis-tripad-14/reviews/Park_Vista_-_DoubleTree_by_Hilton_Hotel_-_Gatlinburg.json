However, the rooms are old and tired. No executive lounge for Hilton gold and diamond members. Only gave one breakfast coupon per day, when there was 2 of us (HH benefit is 2). When I asked the front desk if there was an executive lounge I was told \"I don't think so\".

The views are spectacular. The pool area is excellent for all ages, and great fun for the children.

I knew we were arriving early for the 4PM check-in (it was 1PM) but decided to ask at the desk anyway. The woman was very nice and called housekeeping to check for cleaned rooms - there was only one room available on the 1st floor, which we declined (we wanted a \"view\" room). Instead we opted to go to the lobby restaurant, have lunch and kill a little time. We loved their lunch selections - spent about 1 1/2 hours chatting with the staff and eating, then went back to the front desk to ask about our room. Unfortunately we weren't able to add our lunch bill to our room because we hadn't checked in yet. It was around 2:30 when we went back to the desk and they still had NO rooms to offer us. So the lady at the desk put a \"block\" on a specific room for us and told housekeeping (for the 2nd time) that we were patiently waiting in the lobby. This routine went on every hour until exactly 4:05PM when our room was magically \"clean\" and ready for occupancy. We are Hilton Honor's Members and travel quite often - many times arriving earlier than the posted check-in time. I can't ever remember waiting in a lobby for 3 hours while they cleaned a room - and the housekeeping staff knew we were waiting!!. Once in the room, we noticed that the ice bucket lid was missing. We called 2 times to request the lid and still never received it by the time we checked out. Also, I could write my name in the dust on top of the desk and there was way too much mold on the grout in the tub (how long did it take them to \"clean\" this room??). When I noticed that I had no \"service\" on my cell phone, I asked the staff where I could find the pay phone. They have no pay phone, so they offered me their desk phone if my call was local. Since I was calling out of the area, we had to ride the trolley into town, just to make our call. Our whole stay was just one inconvenience after another. I wouldn't recommend this hotel until they have revamped their housekeeping staff and gain control of their hotel.", "user": "FloridaBuzz", "date": "July 31, 2013", "id": 170111585}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Just okay overall... Service was mediocre at best", "text": "I know there are a lot of very positive reviews for this hotel and there are many positives. The rooms are a little worn but nice and the view is beautiful but that is about the best we can say. It started with check in which was a fiasco.... Check in was at 4pm but by the time we were able to get a room it was about 5:30pm and the room we originally had was swapped to someone else who did not like their first room. So that was the room we got. The wait was because they were\"refreshing\" it making sure it was \"perfect\" per the manager. Well it wreaked with bleach smell covering up an offensive odor that was bleeding through if you know what I mean.... Then there was the coffee maker that malfunctioned which literally left my wife's tongue black for most of a day. Reported to the front desk they were going to replace the coffee maker which do not believe ever happened... Then at the pool no towels despite calls to the front desk my multiple guests over the course of nearly an hour. Had to get 2 hand towels from the gym to dry my 5 year old and leave so not sure when they arrived. The shuttle was a little sporadic and slow. There is a $5 come and go all day parking near the convention center on Historic Nature Airport Road (or something like that). Overall the hotel was fine, just disappointed in the service and management. Also, if you book through a third party such as Expedia, Hotel.com etc...I would be careful as this location originally had problems with the reservation when we booked and another guest had an issue asking them to double pay due to the records after they had paid in full. I am a Hilton Honors member and generally like Hilton properties but we will pass on this one in the future.", "user": "Patrick D", "date": "July 30, 2013", "id": 169985307}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful!", "text": "We were in Gatlinburg and stayed 2 nights at Park Vista.

This hotel has spectacular views of the mountains and a quiet serene location. Our room was clean and comfortable with an awesome view of the Smokies via a standing balcony!! The indoor pool area looked great for kids and room service was very good! The only negative I could see was the gift shop area. The \"gift shop\" is a room behind the check in desk that does not have a cashier, you have to take your purchases to the check in desk to pay. Both times we tried to do this there was a very long line as only one person was working at the desk, it was fine for us but I did hear many people becoming frustrated in line.The hotel is not really in walking distance to the town as it is up a very steep hill, however there is trolley to transport you there. We didn't utilize the trolley, we decided to drive instead and we were in the town within minutes. I have to say as we were walking through the town, this hotel looked to be the nicest. We appreciated the beautiful quiet location and clean rooms. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.
