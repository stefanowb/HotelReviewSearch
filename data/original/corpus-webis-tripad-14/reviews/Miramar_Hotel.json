Very convenient for getting around the Altstadt, and not far from the cultural attractions of Frankfurt. Reasonable walking distance from the Hauptbahnhof. The staff are helpful and speak English. Like all smaller hotels in Germany the elevator is real slow (and small), at times you wonder if it's stopped, but it gets you there. The room decor is a bit startling, with more fake burr walnut panelling than you'd expect in a fake Rolls-Royce factory, and bright cheerful colours that somehow do work together but shouldn't.
