It's off the beaten track although a few travel companies do take their tours here if only for a night. We travelled independently and treated ourselves to 3 nights - and would happily have stayed longer. The aristocratic owners have not only converted their palatial property for tourists, they are attempting sustainable tourism for the 70 or so surrounding villages still under their care. The grounds, common rooms and hotel rooms are individual (they have 2-3 painters who are brothers who have a full-time job handpainting and decoarting the rooms), spacious and relaxing. Very enjoyable for instance is the open verandah bar where on comfortable sofas you can sip a drink. We had a 2-storeyed suite with a verandah with swing and a rooftop terrace with a view of the peacocks which wander into the garden towards evening. We went on the village safari - our only real opportunity to see some rural alternatives- and one of us went riding at dawn; there are very well kept stables.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "brs", "date": "December 30, 2005", "id": 4311453}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "confortable", "text": "Yet what we enjoyed most was that we could wander around the village of Rohet unaccosted.

The shop on the hotel grounds sells handcrafts made locally and part of the profits go to a local charity.
