The staff at the hotel was excellent and anxious to please. The unit was spacious with a very comfortable king-sized bed, terrific water pressure in the shower, a magnificent view of the mountains, and plenty of room to spread out in the living room area and kitchen. The pool area was nice and the exercise facility was amazing. Although there are no restaurants in the hotel as it is actually a time-share condo property, the adjacent mall in the Pinon Pointe shops had a Starbucks, Cold Stone Creamery, a delicious Continental restaurant with live evening music and best of all the Wildflower Cafe for the BEST breakfasts, lunches, light dinners, and snacks. As well as this being a wonderful property, the location cannot be beat. It is walking distance to just about everything. We were required to listen to a presentation on the property but the people were kind, informative and not too pushy.
