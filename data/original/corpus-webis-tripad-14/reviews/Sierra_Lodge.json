The hotel does have a light continental breakfast, cereal, bagels, coffee. However, I chose to walk a short distance to a restaurant that served a big hot breakfast. There is a nice lounge room with a fireplace and there is a mountain view from this room. The staff were friendly and helpful. On the main street in front of the lodge there is a bus stop where you can catch a ride up to the slopes.

You know how they say \"dollar for dollar, the Subaru WRX or the Mustang Boss are the fastest cars for the money.\" Well, the same can be said for the quality of the Sierra Lodge. I'm a research guy. Love Consumer Reports. Before my trip, I researched the heck out of all the available lodgings in Mammoth. If I seem a bit fanatical, that's the way I get when my research proves true, and that's what Sierra Lodge did on every level. Did I want an in-room jacuzzi, no. Did I want an in-room jacuzzi, no. Did I appreciate the covered parking and outside ski lockers and complimentary continental breakfast, HECK YES! This place is everything you need and nothing you don't.
