This last trip we had our camera bag taken (Nikon & Minolta lost) from our locked room. The guests across the courtyard from us lost a lap-top, I-pod, and camera from their locked room the same weekend. The maid had been there and the door was secure in both instances. The maids have a habit of leaving the doors open and not blocking the open doorways with their carts while cleaning, meaning anyone could have entered while she was in the bathroom or wherever. So, I am not saying I believe the house keeping staff did it themselves - they simply provided the opportunity. Shame on us for leaving valuables in the room. We were also there last January. When we got home my wife noticed she had jewelry missing. We figured she had just misplaced it. Now we think otherwise. Same hotel.
