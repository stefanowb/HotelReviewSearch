We spent 3 nights here, and loved it. A quiet, authentic experience with genuine hospitality. If you are looking for a place to RELAX and enjoy a private breakfast in a stunning garden with views of the Andes, this is the place for you! The family who runs the inn couldnt have been more accomodating and helpful.
