The hotel room is clean and tidy although slightly on the small side but adequate for an overnight stay. If you fancy a walk, which I would recommend to get your bearings for your departure to the airport the following day, turn right when leaving the hotel walking through the industrial estate and go either by the stairs or if you are with cases you would prefer to take the lift into the NEC where you find yourself at the NEC train station. There you will see a monorail which is free and takes only two or three minutes into the airport. The monorail does not run between the hours of 2.00-4.00 am This would not be ideal for anybody who is elderly or not reasonably fit as the walk takes approximately ten minutes. At the airport I would recommend Wetherspoons for a pint and a reasonable meal at sensible prices. The reception does provide a map although it is not really required.
