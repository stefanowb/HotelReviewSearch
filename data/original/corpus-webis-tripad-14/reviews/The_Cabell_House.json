We stayed in the Claiborne Room. The room was small and the bathroom was tiny. The sink in the bathroom is extremely small reminding us of an outdoor drinking fountain with little room to even wash your hands. The rain-head shower is also a small corner shower and the is no tub. The bathroom was obviously a closet turned into a bathroom. The room was clean but smelled like clorox and, not being able to open the windows, we could not get rid of the smell our whole stay. There was a pot of dead hyacinths on the dresser. We chose to eat at the sister inn, the Palmer House, for breakfast at a cost of $5 for each of us. The breakfast was adequate but not inspiring - grits, cold scrabbled eggs, bacon, sausage patties, canned peaches mixed with fresh strawberries, coffee, juice. Complimentary breakfast was offered at the Cabell House which was big boxes of cereal, bread, coffee and juice.", "title": "Great Location but uninspiring", "user": "Butcher.T", "date": "April 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 14980994, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the location", "disliked": "\u2014 bathroom and room odor"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "Randy, the innkeeper, was very pleasant.

I spoke with the proprietor, Randy, by phone when making my reservation and she was very friendly and said she looked forward to meeting us both. However, when we arrived at 3 pm, we were greeted at the door by the housekeeper. She showed us to our room, and noted that Randy was \"in the back.\" She did not give us any further tour or information. We left for dinner and then came back to settle in for the evening. Despite an outdoor temperature of 51 degrees, our room thermostat was set at 60 and the room was actually 58 degrees. Needless to say, we were freezing! The thermostat was in a locked box, so that we were not able to make any changes. This was around 8 pm. My sister stuck her head out of the room and just happened to bump into Randy, who then very nicely changed the thermostat and went and gathered up some hot chocolate for us. The remainder of the evening was quite nice. The house is quite beautiful, a 19th century Charleston home that is only about 2 blocks from the battery. It was also very clean. The following morning, we had been told (by letter, prior to our stay--we never did receive any \"orientation\" from the staff) that breakfast was from 9 - 10:30 am. I had told Randy by email about a week prior that we would be eating there at the B&B and we told them again when we arrived (and it was marked in bright orange on my check in sheet). However, we left our room with our luggage at around 9:15 am and met Randy coming down in her robe--she said \"I was trying to sneak by.\" My sister said that we wanted to come down and eat a quick breakfast before leaving. Randy seemed surprised that we were eating there and then reminded me that we needed to pay (even though I had already done so by credit card in advance). She then said she would get dressed and come down. However, a few minutes later, David (whose exact role there I'm unsure of) came down and helped us with breakfast. He was very helpful, though admittedly unsure of what he needed to do. The cereal that was available was all in open boxes that had been sitting on the sideboard for, it appeared, quite some time. Otherwise, breakfast was good. We then had to ask the housekeeper for out receipt in order to sign, as Randy had still not come downstairs, and we were ready to leave for the day. Overall, the facility was quite beautiful, but I would not choose to stay there again based on the service we received.", "title": "Tremendous!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mike3513", "date": "November 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 11138398}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Room was spacious, super-clean, furnished with lovely antiques, and was very comfortable.
