We stayed in a deluxe room (#14) and were impressed with the cleanliness and the quaint decor and lovely atmosphere of Kuyaba. We had dinner and breakfast at the Kuyaba restaurant and the food was excellent!!! The food was Jamaican and authentic and very well prepared. We did not spend any time on the beach, but we did dine ocean front at dinner and at breakfast and found the beach to be so very beautiful, but small. The servers at the restaurant provided the best service and were very attentive but not overly so. We only stayed there one night because our regular resort was overbooked for one night, but we are so glad to find Kuyaba and we will be back. It is a great alternative to the larger all-inclusive resorts in Jamaica, and the price is right!

The rooms are really nice--they have individual patios with hammocks, and a huge bathroom with an open shower and a deep Jacuzzi tub. The water is entirely drinkable, gets and stays hot, and the air conditioning in the bedrooms keeps it cool all night. The staff are some of the sweetest people I've met; like other reviewers, I was increasingly impressed by the concierge, Zelma, and the bartenders, waiters, security guards, and housekeeping.

A friend had recommended Kuyaba and so we booked it based completely on this recommendation. After Montego Bay we found Negril's beach to be far superior. The 7 Mile Beach is quite stunning with the perfect Caribbean water. Kuyaba was a real find in many ways - but not without it's issues. The rooms were good - very adequate, clean, and comfortable for the money. The facility is very cool - very rustic, jungly and great setting - right on the beach. The restaurant and bar has an amazing setting and feel about it, but, contrary to all the other reviews we read here, we found the food pretty terrible. The breakfast was pretty good - but we ate here for dinner a few nights and nothing that any of us had was at all good. Even the simple pasta dish was pretty terrible. Worse than that, though, was the service. The only person that seemed to care at all about us was Kevin, the guard on the beach. He was the best! And Yes, there is a guard 24/7 on the beach (and at the front of the property from the road) - to help keep the \"solicitors\" at bay and off the property. When going to Negril one has to be prepared for this. The people trying to sell you everything from a large variety of drugs, hair-braiding, crafts, massages, etc is non-stop. I will say, it never felt threatening or dangerous, but definitely annoying after awhile. Also, the smell of marijuana is very pervasive. At all hours of the day and night. I don't care that much if people are smoking pot around me, but it's a bit much when we are going down to breakfast at 8am and the smell of pot is everywhere! And it continues throughout the day.
