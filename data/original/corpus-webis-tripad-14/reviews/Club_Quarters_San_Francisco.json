My girlfriend and I took our three grown children for the Chinese New Year's Celebration weekend, and were able to walk back after all the festivities without having to fight the massive crowds. The next day, we hopped on the cable car to ride down to Fishermans Wharf for sour dough bread, clam chowder, chocolate and to see the Sea Lions at Pier 39. Then we took the other line back up to Chinatown for \"dim sum\" and walked down to catch BART to go under the trans-Bay tunnel. This place is a private, members only establishment during the business week because its in the heart of the business/financial district. But on the weekends its open to those who know about it. Rooms are neat and clean but a little small for a family trip (that's why we needed two rooms), but the location is worth the cramped space (esp. if all you need is a place to sleep.)
