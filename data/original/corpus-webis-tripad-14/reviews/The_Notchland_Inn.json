We did not stay at the inn. The inn is in a beautiful setting and is very nice. Very clean and well maintained. However, I would not recommend the Notchland Inn to anyone. We were treated very rudly by the woman who seemed to be in charge of the arrangements. (I do not know her name) During the dinner, the doors to the private dining room we were in were closed by the staff. It began to get very cold in the room and one of the guests asked if she could keep the doors open as we were very cold. She told us she would only keep the doors open if we kept our voices down...that there were other guests celebrating things as well. I understand that, however there were only 11 guests at the wedding and we were not by any means overly noisy during the dinner. We were all astonished by this. None of us had ever been treated like this, especially at a wedding.", "title": "One of our very favorites", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MrArtie", "date": "October 24, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6008231}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "The ceremony was very nice, and the owners very pleasant. Didn't see them again after the ceremony. Dinner on the other hand was a disappointment. The wedding ended at 5:40pm. We were ignored until approximately 7:50pm. We snacked on the jar of pistachio nuts from one of the sitting rooms! The service was very slow. Did not finish dinner until around 9:30pm. Sometimes 20-30 minutes between courses. And the food was average, nothing special and very small portions. (The best man went out to get pizza as soon as dinner was over!) I realize when such a big party stays at an Inn, they can be noisy. As I said, we did not stay at the inn the previous night and do not know how loud the wedding guests were that night. Regardless of what happened the night before, there was no reason for the staff (mainly one woman) to treat us the way we were treated. I only hope the bride and groom remember the ceremony and not the treatment of their guests. We left very shortly after dinner and will not return to the inn. Had it not been for this, we would have considered a stay there. Instead we will recommend other beautiful inns we have stayed at to our friends and steer them away from the Notchland Inn.
