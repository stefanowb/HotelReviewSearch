The facilities are clean, well kept and follow a \"bloomy\" style of interior design. The high ceiling rooms are very clean, have a work desk , mini bar, but overpriced Deutsche Telekom wireless access. The included breakfast buffet is kept simple, but is sufficient for the German taste. Late night check in is accommodated by an automated machine on the outside of the hotel. As the hotel is located close to the train station in Hof, the overall area is not that nice, but still safe, and it is only a short 10 minute walk to the city center. Overall, this is a good hotel for a business stay, but also quite suitable if you are visiting friends and family in the area, or a nice overnight stay if you are on the road in this region.", "title": "Nice little hotel close to the train station", "user": "redwrangler8", "date": "June 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 17188824, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff, cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 Location"}}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 8, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 3}, "slim_ranking": 0.4}
