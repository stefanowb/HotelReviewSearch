The place has a definite \"summer camp\" kind of feel. Our room, while perfectly serviceable, was a bit old and worn out, particularly the bathroom. It was fine - but rather disappointing for $200 a night. My husband and I are both in fine shape, but found it pretty incredulous that there was no one to help with our luggage since our buliding was located above a very steep hill. We ended up driving the car up the hill to avoid carrying all our stuff up, but backing down the steep, winding hill was not easy. I saw little golf carts zipping around - I'd like to know why they don't use one of those to help guests with this problem. The restaurant was alright, but pretty overpriced as well. The entrees are are all about $25 and up - but not that well executed. The duck confit was rubbery. That said, the grounds were pretty pleasant and we enjoyed a morning hike on the Sycamore trail.", "title": "Relaxing & enjoyable, but facilities not up to cost of the place.", "user": "esheng", "date": "September 5, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 5772325}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was a little reticent to come here, but the bad reviews seemed to be due to bad luck.

From having to run your own luggage up a hill. To the unfriendly staff and tiny room. For the price it was a ripoff. The room was barely a step up from motel 6. $200.00 a night for that! wow! We expected so much more. This is not a resort. The staff was more interested in chatting with each other than to help the guests. With the exception of a couple helpful staff members. With Pismo beach close by. Spend the hotel money at a nice place in Pismo.
