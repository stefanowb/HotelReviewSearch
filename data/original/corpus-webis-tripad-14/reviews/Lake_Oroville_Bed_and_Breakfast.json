What a beautiful place! The inn is way up in the hills out on 40 acres overlooking the Valley and the Lake. It felt like Heaven. My husband & I sat on the patio and just stared out on nature and listened to the birds in the trees. What a wonderful retreat from reality! The inn itself is well cared for, clean and comfortable. The bed was so comfortable we hardly wanted to get up in the morning! But we were glad we did because breakfast was delicious!!! While taking in the amazing view we enjoyed splendid blueberry pancakes, fresh fruit and delicious egg&cheese cups.", "user": "daisymay1", "date": "September 18, 2007", "id": 8751718}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful Inn!", "text": "The innkeeper was friendly and helpful.", "user": "Kirby12345", "date": "August 1, 2005", "id": 3727570}], "location": {}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 5}, "slim_ranking": 1.0, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 3.5}}
