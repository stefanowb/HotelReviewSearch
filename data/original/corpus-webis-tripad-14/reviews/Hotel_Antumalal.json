The setting is gorgeous, the rooms are cozy with expansive lake views and a fireplace, the restaurant's food is delicious, and the common areas are perfect for lounging around in front of the fire with a glass of wine. Although we visited the lake region before the weather was such that activities in the lake were possible, there are so many other things to do in the area (hiking, thermal springs, horseback riding, etc.) and the staff is more than happy to give advice and help with arrangements. Furthermore, the hotel's price is very reasonable for the fabulousness of the place.

We found the relative isolation was what made the place....and Pucon centre was an easy enough walk away (around 1/2 hr) and an easier taxi ride.

We stayed 3 nights and we found every encounter with the restaurant, including the room service, really frustrating. The wait staff disappeared for extraordinarily long periods of time while we all sat around waiting to order; breakfast would be packed up well in advance of closing time and would have to be unpacked for us and a number of other couples; we are still waiting for the simple food and drink order on our last day there- empanadas and sprite didnt arrive after 50 minutes, even after a couple of reminders that we needed to go to the airport- so we had to cancel and go hungry. A couple of the days they had buffet rather than al a carte and even still 2 wait staff just could not cope with relatively few guests and management did not seem to assist when needed.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "llama_112", "date": "July 25, 2006", "id": 5510687}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "We knew some rudimentary spanish but the room service staff knew no english- which I found surprising for a hotel which has about 80% of its guests from overseas; ordering 3 courses and drinks over the phone started having echoes of Fawlty Towers.
