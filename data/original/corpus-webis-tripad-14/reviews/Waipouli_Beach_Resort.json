Go through a private owner and save $$ over booking w/ Outrigger. What a value: 2 bdrm, 3 ba, and a sleeper sofa. Wolf range and Subzero fridge and dual dishwashers. Fully equipped kitchen. Only missing appliances happened to be the two we use the most: toaster oven and rice cooker. Loved everything in the condo with the exception of a very squeaky bed. For those with small children that nap during the day, you may request a unit that has carpet in the hallway in front of the unit. Some of the hallways are heavy stone tiles and the housekeeping carts make a lot of noise over them - it may wake up sleeping beauty. The location in Kapaa is perfect for groceries with Foodland and Safeway right across the street (couldn't believe other residents actually drove across the street to shop.) Starbucks, Cold Stone, McD's, and other restaurants across the street too. Within 2 miles to Wailua River kayaks, Lydgate State Park, and historic Kapaa town.
