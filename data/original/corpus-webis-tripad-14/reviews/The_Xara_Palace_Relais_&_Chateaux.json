Without a shadow of doubt, the place to stay in Malta is Mdina and in Mdina the Xara Palace stands out as the best alternative. Valetta holds many tourist attractions, but precisely because of that it feels overcrowded. By contrast, Mdina, especially after five o'clock, offers a captivating experience with its narrow and silent streets that transport you in time. The service throughout was impeccable and unobstrusive. The reception desk was informative and efficient (got us tickets for the Hypogeum).

However he was blown away by both Mdina and the Xara Palace. In Mdina itself most of the bars and restaurants were closed but we were only there for 3 days in any case. We ate at the hotel one night and at Bacchus twice. There will be much more choice during the main holiday season. As for the Xara Palace we were in Room 6, the largest of the basic rooms and it was magnificent. A very large seating are downstairs furnished with antiques together with a small balcony. Upstairs was the bed and the bathroom. During our stay the staff couldn't have been more helpful and the room was spotless. The view from the breakfast room was spectacular. On the day we checked out we were allowed to use Room 7 to freshen up which had the real WOW factor. It had 2 shower rooms, a roof terrace with hot tub and silk furnishings. Brad Pitt and Sharon Stone have stayed in it. If you want lots of bars and nightlife then don't stay in Mdina but if you want sophistication and a wonderful base to go back to then choose Mdina and Xara Palace.

Having looked at the hotel\u2019s website, we were expecting to have a relaxing and comfortable stay in beautiful surroundings. The surroundings are certainly beautiful, but we found our room to be cramped and dilapidated and definitely not relaxing. The bathroom wasn\u2019t particularly impressive \u2013 the shower screen was rusty and the shower temperature and pressure were very variable. The seating area was far too small to relax in and there was only one small wardrobe and a chest of drawers for storage. The air conditioning was old and noisy so we had to turn it off at night so we could sleep. Due to the noise from the street outside, it was impossible to sleep with the window open so the room got very hot at night. Our biggest bugbear, however, was the stairs between the mezzanine sleeping area and the seating area/bathroom. The lack of handrail alongside most of the steps made them dangerous at night and the loud squeaking they made meant that neither of us could use them without waking the other one up.
