The place is for sale and the upkeep on our unit was poor. It was all still usable (except the microwave that didn't work) but the room needed a good cleaning. The bathroom is TINY and there is very little space to put one's clothes. On the plus side, it was quieter than we expected and we were able to use one of two free parking spaces adjacent to our room. We were able to have lunch on the deck just outside the room. There was no space for a table inside the room.

Cool spot, good location, funky garden area. But when we viewed our room we were slightly disappointed. We booked online where it explicity stated the rooms were \"spacious\" with hardwood floors and other charming features. Our room was on the first level and was just big enough to fit the King size bed and the bad carpet. We got over this though and decided to enjoy our vacation. Came back from dinner that night and went for a pleasant hot tub. This, however, turned out to the the \"warm tub\". When we questioned the host about it the next morning he promised to turn on the heat for us, but never did. This was all bearable, but the big thumbs down point of this place was that breakfast was served directly outside of our bedroom window, which was directly beside our bed! So each morning at 0700 it felt like all the other guests were in bed with us! When we complained (constructively of course) our host was very unhelpful, stating \"No one has ever complained before\". The whole experience put a slight damper on our vacation.", "title": "Nice place but....", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "spooner1000", "date": "November 16, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 2828488}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great place to stay", "text": "I was very pleased with my recent stay at the Blue Skies Inn in Key West.

There is some off street parking available on a first come, first serve basis. There is no pool but the beach is nearby and you can purchase a pass to the Wyndham if desired. The only complaint I have is that the mattress had an awful plastic mattress pad that was quite uncomfortable to sleep on due to its noise and the fact that it makes you sweat.

They are frequent travelers to Key West, but it was my husband and I's first time. We went to see the Southernmost Point which isn't far. Then we decided to go to our friends room in this hotel around 3pm. They had some drinks and we made some. Keep in mind, we are all over the age of 30 and were just trying to spend some time with our friends. Next thing we know, at about 3:30 pm, there was a knock at the door. A woman (I assume the owner) was standing there and asking how our stay was. We told her fine. She snapped at my husband and I and asked where we were staying. I told her Island City House and she glared at me as if I were lying. My husband leaned over the top of a wicker chair in an uncomfortable effort to understand what was going on. At this point the woman snapped at him and asked if he leans on his furniture like this at home. Our eyes were wide as ever! I was shocked this woman was talking to us like we were highshcool or college kids!
