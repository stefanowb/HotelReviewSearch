It's not luxury and it has no interesting views as it's tucked away in a side street, but it is clean, comfortable and friendly. Rooms lack some of the amenities we expect in western Europe, such as coffee and tea making facilities in the room, but this seems to be standard across Georgia and Armenia except in the large international chain hotels. It does have free in-room Wi-Fi, which is certainly not yet always the case in British hotels. They serve a good breakfast and had just a bar service for food on the evenings we were there, although the in-room documentation suggested there is normally a restaurant service.", "title": "Good accommodation well located", "user": "Steve-G23", "date": "October 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180566501}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled on business", "text": "and the hotel Europe is still excellent.
