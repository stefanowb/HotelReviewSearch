Since this area has built up, it has plenty of attractions close by, including some great restaurants and excellent walking trails. The hotel is a Bed and Breakfast, with the most unusual breakfasts we have ever experienced in similar places. The owners have a good balance between offering friendly service without being intrusive. The hotel gives the feel of being more isolated and private than it actually is in regard to close proximity to other buildings and roads.
