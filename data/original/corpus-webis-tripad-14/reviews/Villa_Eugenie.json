I know European hotel rooms are small by American standards, but our superior room was uncomfortably small. We could only unpack one suitcase and live out the other! As mentioned in other reviews, it's very noisy as well. Closing the windows provides some relief from passing trains and motorcycles, but the air-conditioning system doesn't push enough cold air to cool down the micro-room. So you have one of two options... learn to live with the noise or swim in a pool of your own sweat. The area is not bad nor is it great. There're a few restaurants, bars, patisseries a supermarche and lavarie nearby. The distance to the Wagram Metro wasn't a huge factor since we usually took in breakfast along the way. The front desk staff was the hotels only saving grace. It's a 3 star hotel at best.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "May 25, 2004", "id": 2116708}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Don't let the bedbugs bite!", "text": "I was so thrilled about the Villa Eugenie when I first booked the hotel, and would have to say that our experience there was almost flawless, except for one tiny (crawling) problem. Bedbugs. I awoke after my first night in the Villa Eugenie after a comfortable and restful sleep to find both my arms and shoulders covered in huge, swollen bites. My friend experienced the same problem the next night. Although according to news stories bedbugs are becoming a problem all across Europe, I certainly wasn't expecting them! My point is this: keep in mind that this epidemic may be occuring across numerous areas and is not simply restricted to this hotel. Yes, they were here (and they ate rather well, I think), but they may be everywhere. The presence of these little pests is the only reason I rate this hotel at a 2 and not a 4. Truly, the hotel itself is charming: lovely staff, lovely room. Huge bath towels that are like heaven after a long day of walking.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "katecolorado", "date": "January 4, 2006", "id": 4325140}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Nice hotel, bad location", "text": "Other reviews mentioned the hotel's distance from the attractions of Paris (Louvre, Musee d'Orsey, L'Arc de Triomphe, Tour Eiffel, etc.) this was not a problem for us because the metro is so close to the hotel. Take advantage of the multiple-day metro pass in Paris! The metro is exceedingly easy to use, and the Villa Eugenie is not \"out of the way\" when considering how fast the metro is. \u20ac26 for a five day pass which pays itself off almost immediately in convenience!", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 16, 2005", "id": 3778125}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved the Villa Eugenie", "text": "Nice hotel, with friendly and helpful staff but we would not stay again as the location did not suit us - I think this is reflected in the good rate we paid from Expedia. Difficult to get back to late at night and we would rather not spend so much time on local travel during the day. The market on Rue de Levis (from Rue Legendre on the way to Villiers Metro) is a great place to pick up fresh bread and produce and there are also several nice cafes here and around the corner on Avenue de Villiers for sitting and people-watching. If you are using the Metro, it is a much nicer walk from the hotel down to Villiers rather than straight down Rue de Rome to Rome metro. Restaurant Les Bouchons de Francois Clerc on Rue de la Terrasse is one of several around Paris that have a reputation for good food and a very well priced wine list. It looked interesting but was closed when we were there.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 28, 2005", "id": 3708453}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Enjoyed the Villa Eugenie", "text": "Safe travels.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 8, 2004", "id": 2872538}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2003", "text": "Just back from a great 3 night stay at the Villa Eugine.", "title": "A real home from home", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "totoBowdon", "date": "November 18, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 2833547}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Paris"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 43, "average": 66, "very good": 68, "terrible": 40, "excellent": 26}, "aka": "Villa Eugenie Hotel Paris", "slim_ranking": 0.75404350251, "description": "Villa Eugenie is a charming hotel that pays tribute to the period marked by Napoleon III, situated in the 17th arrondissement next to the picturesque Butte Montmarte and Sacr\u00e9 Coeur.
