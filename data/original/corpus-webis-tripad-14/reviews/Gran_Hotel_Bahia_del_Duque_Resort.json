However not everyone can have a good night every night so it was no big deal. We did not find the food to be that great for the class of hotel. The biggest let down was the kids food at the Bar Azul, the fish fingers and chicken goujons were awful.

The reception we received was extremely friendly and the kids were given a little present of slippers which I thought was a nice touch and kept them amused whilst we checked in. I was disappointed with the room (no. 105) as it was in need of renovation (the tiles on the walls were dated 1993). Very dark furniture and some bad instances of DIY. Not what I expected for a five star hotel. The bath was not clean. Room was quite large though as we had to fit a cot in as well with a pull out sofa bed for our 2 1/2 yr old. The grounds are immaculate. We were expecting to be a bit more pampered for example offered cool towels around the pool, waiters offering drinks etc. If you wanted a drink round the pool you usually had to wait until someone else had been to the bar and the waiter delivered them then you had to catch his attention.", "title": "Not as expected", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "aileen30", "date": "June 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 66772130}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010", "text": "I have to disagree with the comments about the kids disco.
