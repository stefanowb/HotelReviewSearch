The breakfast, which I only had once, was not really worth it, the coffee was just terrible and the choices very limited - better to head out and sit at a cafe up the street. I was able to check in early, which was a good thing. The desk clerk was less than helpful when I couldn't get the internet to work, and I had already paid.
