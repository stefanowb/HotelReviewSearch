The room itself was bigger than it looked in the pictures online. Had a nice kitchenette with breakfast bar, large bathroom with 2 person jacuzzi tub, table for 6, smaller living room with sofa/sofa bed pullout, and bedroom. So size was a plus for the most part. BUT, the bedroom itself was pretty small. It was tight getting the pack n play in, but it did fit - although we opted to keep it in the living area at night. Our biggest complaint about the living room was the tv placement. It was set so high up it was a strain on your neck to look at it. The fireplace was nice though.

My other main complaints have to do with bedding also. They deliver the pack n play with a full size sheet wrapped around it. Someone should know that is NOT safe. I thought ahead and brought a sheet for it - but still, I would think sheets that fit would be something the hotel could invest in. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable as far as the mattress goes.
