However the front desk guy had a bad attitude from the start, he seemed as if he was doing us a favour by checking us in and didn't give any help on where we could park. He was also answering the phone while talking to us, which I found very rude indeed. Then as he was so distracted by answering the phone, he told us that we had room 101 and when we walked in we were confronted by other guests who were gobsmacked that we had just walked into their room. When we went back to sort it out we got told that he'd made a mistake that we should have 103, along with a half hearted apology that was interrupted again by him answering the phone. The room was pretty basic, no AC which was awful only a squeaky ceiling fan. The sink was blocked which they sorted out pretty quickly. The room was right on an alley that people walked down day and night so it was hard to sleep as you had to have the window open because there was no AC. I thought it was overpriced because for $240 per night you expect AC at least. To top it all off they tried to charge us $10 for parking on the first night when we had to walk 9 blocks back from the place we finally found to park. This place would be good value at around $100 per night with free parking.

I love the simplicity of the Hotel Oceana. There's no carpeting in the rooms, so no perfume smell built in. You can borrow bikes from the front desk (for free) when you ask. It's charming & not snobby. Breakfast is included, but nothing to rave about - for $5 they will make you a decent omelette. The location is perfect. This last trip we had a King Ocean view room & it was the best trip yet! Yes, it can be a little loud as it's a great location along the main boulevard. I suggest ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. The front desk staff was incredibly polite & helpful whenever we had a question. They had great suggestions for lunch & dinner (try Emilio's, a 2 min walk). We didn't have a car & walked everywhere in SB! Another alternative is to take the 25 cent trolly that'll take you downtown or along the waterfront.
