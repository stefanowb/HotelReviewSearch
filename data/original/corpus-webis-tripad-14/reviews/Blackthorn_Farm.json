We had the family room : double bed with two singles : which was large and had views of the sea. Cracking cooked breakfast and we pre-ordered the night before so as not to delay in the morning. Would recomend smoked Haddock and poached eggs - with a sqeeze of lemon on the side and some black pepper -yummy. Richard very welcoming and it felt like someone's home rather than just a B and B business. Lots of space outside for children to play and they also allow well behaved dogs to stay.", "title": "Ideal for families, immaculately clean, beautiful location,close to ferry.", "user": "BaaCheshireUK", "date": "April 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 60311788}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We turned up at Blackthorn Farm after seeing the sign on the road outside. We stayed in a family room with a double and two single beds, there were only two of us so we had plenty of room! We also had a great sea view and a small but spotleesly clean bathroom. The owners are friendly and helpful, and the breakfast superb (I had the haddock- fantastic!). Blackthorn Farm is ideally located for the Anglesey Coastal path, which is simply a breathtaking walk. There is also a caravan/camping park attached to the farm which is popular with people travelling to and from Ireland via Holyhead. All in all a really nice B&B in a great spot with wonderful views- recommended!", "title": "Lovely isolated farmhouse B&B", "user": "TopFrog", "date": "October 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 47578545}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 5, "very good": 17, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 86}, "aka": "Blackthorn Farm Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0909090909091, "description": "Blackthorn Farm is a family run Bed & Breakfast and campsite. Set in 18 acres of outstanding beauty, Blackthorn Farm has stunning views for everyone, whether you are camping or staying as guests in one of our eight Bed and Breakfast rooms. If you prefer to stay in self catering accommodation, we have a number of options available to you, both on site and in the Trearddur Bay area. We are within walking distance of one of the two Blue Flag beaches Trearddur Bay has to offer, and there are a multitude of coves, rock pools and smaller beaches all along the coastal road that leads in to Trearddur Bay, which is less than two and a half miles long. We are licensed to sell alcohol and we are no more than ten minutes drive away from several popular restaurants and pubs while maintaining the quietness one would expect from a much more rural location. The area itself is popular with people with all sorts of hobbies, from water sports to horse riding to bird watching and has lots of wonderful, well mapped walks to explore."}
