Up 3 flights of steps to the room was already a worry but when door was opened it was a really pleasant suprise. Large room, large really comfortable bed and actually had furniture( see previous days hotel review) TV, big bathroom with good shower and heated towel rack. Bed was just wonderful. Very quiet room despite being in a pub when Wales had just beaten Scotland. Loved the pub itself with its many comfortable sitting areas and we really enjoyed both our dinner and breakfast.
