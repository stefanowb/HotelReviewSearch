We were in Vancouver for a Canucks game. The hotel is only 2 short blocks from the Stadium/Chinatown sky train station, and you walk right past Rogers Arena and B.C. Place Stadium.

It was very spacious, with a very comfortable king size bed and pullout couch. 2 tvs, full size fridge, dishwasher, and 2 burner hot plate with the cupboards filled with all the dishes or popcorn bowls you could need. Free National Post each morning at your door....The room had a doorbell (my son loved that), an umbrella in the closet and an in room safe. The 16th floor has spectacular views. It is also where the spa/gym are. There is a 9 person hot tub, although I'm sure it would fit 15, treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike, free weights as well as weight machines. Foosball table, 2 tvs, leather seating, Sauna, and (according to my son) The most fabulous thing a hotel could ever have.....a Ping Pong Table! Did I mention there was coin operated laundry up there too! I like to use the stairs when I go to hotels, and I did here too...only to discover that some of the floors ...the doors are locked once you're in the stairwell. I had to go 4 - 5 flights down to get onto a floor with a door that was open....so skip the stairwell and use the elevator. Elevators are operated with your room key, so that was nice to know that not just anyone could wander into the hotel and up to any floor they choose. There was a free breakfast each morning till 10. Standard stuff, bagels/bread, cold cereal, fruit, pastry, one hot plate of eggs/sausage, choice of juices/milk oatmeal with toppings, and waffles. Wasn't spectacular, but worth going to save on eating out. There was a small store off the lobby with snacks and souvenirs,and a hair salon. Overall, it was a great weekend away with my son, nice and quiet.
