The rooms are in separate cabanas in a nice garden. Basic, clean, no heat, secure. The beds are lumpy, but did not keep us from sleeping soundly, because it is so quiet. Trees, lots of greenery and flowers, and an Italian restaurant on site with an American chef. Restaurant is closed Mon and Tues. Delicious home-made granola with quinoa for breakfast, and cooked eggs. The son of the host performs rituals using hallucinogenic roots--his father tells us people come from all over the world for these sessions. The hotel is hard to find because it is set apart from the main village, but all the taxis know where it is, and they are cheap and plentiful.

They arranged a taxi to pick up us at airport. They called a taxi and provided walking sticks for our trip to Pisac ruins. When we found that TV in our room lacks DVD player, we asked the hosts and they sent a person who brought a player and connected it to TV. Every evening, a person appeared in our bungalow to start a fireplace for us. The only problem, I could not figure out how to stop smoke from seeping into the room. Aside from this, everything was great. We liked flowers, beautiful garden, and mountain scenery.
