I will be pleased to welcome youy in a house that combines the charm of an old house and the comfort of a fully restored house. Each room has a unique decoration. I can accommodate 1 to 4 people in each room. The rooms are air conditioned, equipped with TV and have a free internet access. The garden allows you to relax and a spa is opened all year long.I also want to seduce you with the quality of my breakfast and my dinner. Everything is home-cooked (jams, yoghurts, cakes, crepes for breakfast) and you can find pictures of dinner's dishes on my Facebook page. I use from small local producers to offer dishes of quality. La Cogn\u00e9e is in an ecological way and working for sustainable development."}
