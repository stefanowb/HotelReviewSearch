This has everything associated with it that is typical of a cheap motel. When I arrived later in the evening to check in, there was no one at the desk to help me and I waited for some time. I finally got my key and went to my room. Yikes. I was in the executive level rooms and let me tell you, I would hate to see the other rooms. My room had very dirty carpeting - it felt oily and greasy and I felt like I couldn't walk around in bare feet. While using my computer, I saw a HUGE SPIDER crawling down the wall. I also saw a mosquito flying around but assumed there was only one. Either that one was really hungry or there were multiple - I woke up with 3 large bug bites. The linens were inexpensive and scratchy. There were no toiletries in the bathroom other than a bar of soap.
