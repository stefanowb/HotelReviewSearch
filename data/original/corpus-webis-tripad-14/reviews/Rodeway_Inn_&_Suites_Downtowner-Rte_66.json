I am very picky about cleanliness and I was surprised when the maids cleaned the room with disinfectant every single day. It smelled like Lysol when you walked in. It was within walking distance to the train that leads to the Grand Canyon and downtown. The breakfast wasn't anything special and we really did not use it, but for $70/day, there is not a better deal around! I LOVED the town of Williams, everybody was very friendly and very quiet. I do recommend taking a trip to Sonoma while there and do the Pink Jeep tours (very fun and beautiful!).
