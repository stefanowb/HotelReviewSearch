We stayed in a room overlooking the main street which was a bad idea. Although it was great to see the action happening in Cairns, the balcony overlooked the main street and the traffic noise was so bad we had to keep our balcony door closed. With heaps of tour buses and heavy traffic, it was very noisy 24/7. There was also construction noise directly opposite which ran for 6-days a week. The hotel proprietors did not tell us about this disruption. The pool was also being repaired and we were not told about this either. The room was adequate however the carpet was moderately stained and the bathroom was not exactly spotless (we found hairs on the floor) and the brown silicone around the bath didn't look particularly stylish! Apart from that, the bed was comfortable, the shower had great pressure and we enjoyed our time in Cairns. We found Cairns to be very touristy with every second shop being a souvenir shop, but a good base for reef trips, etc. If you decide to stay at Il Palazzo, I would suggest asking for a room overlooking the pool - at the back of the hotel where you most likely would not encounter the traffic noise.", "title": "Good location - but noisy!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "JP00777", "date": "April 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7378714, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Noisy!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for three nights in March.

Initially I had tried to book the Hotel Cairns, but in retrospect I feel that Il Palazzo has a significantly better location - right in the middle of everything. I need not make a list , it's close to everything from the grocery store to adult stores. The room was wonderful - the best part being the washer and dryer to do some laundry after a week in Australia. The hotel service was exceptional and very knowledgable about the dozens of trips that all seemed alike to me, a tourist. We had forgotten our cell phone charger at the last hotel and Il Palazzo retrieved a basket of \"orphan\" chargers from the back so we could find one that fit our phone. We were in a room that overlooked the pool and it was quiet for the entire trip, despite the bustle of the streets around us. The wireless internet was available in the lounge, althought I believe that if you have a front room you may get access to the wireless. There is a nominal fee charged per day. I was with my husband, and had no guests, but the room was such that you could shut of the bedroom area and people staying perhaps on the couch could still access the bathroom without bothering someone sleeping. My husband and I agreed that had we come across an apartment in our college days we would have definitely rented it. It's a good layout.
