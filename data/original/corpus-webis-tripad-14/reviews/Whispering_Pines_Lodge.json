(\u2026.which I am now changing.) The working fireplace, the porch out the back door overlooking the river, and the breakfast all went to making a peaceful and restful place to spend a few days. The location is ideal for a little sight seeing if you are the adventuresome type. There is a winding road following the river that has a number of places you can pull off the road and just enjoy the sights and sounds. All in all a place I would unhesitatingly recommend to any and all of my friends.

When I tried to reason with her, she said I could leave right now and closed the door in my face. I understand the lodge has new owners.

When we arrived at the McCambridge Lodge after two days of rafting the Kern River (amazing experience with Whitewater Voyages), the owner had given the one and only \"cabin\" that we reserved two months prior away (and to think I had re-confirmed the reservation just two days prior). We were offered a less than desirable smaller room at a slightly reduced rate for the inconvenience but were so disappointed by the way we were treated at McCambridge (and the less than desirable appearance of the McCambridge inside and out) that we opted to try our luck elsewhere. How fortunate we were to find a room at Whispering Pines Lodge just up the street. It was a bit more pricey but we had an amazing room with full kitchen, gorgeous balcony and a gas fireplace (though not needed in July, it was very pretty and romantic). The decor is perfect and the breakfast was outstanding. Service was great. After getting to know the town a little more, there are a number of quaint places to stay, but why mess with perfection?
