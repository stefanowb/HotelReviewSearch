Yes, it is a little way out of town, but if you are looking for a peaceful relaxing time then this is the place to be, set in some amazing. For those who do want to explore the city, getting there is simple enough - take either the 46b or 146b bus which stops right outside the hotel to the ottakring U3 station and from there, head into town (stephensplatz if you fancy doing a bit of shopping). The whole journey takes about 30 minutes. If you don't like the underground, then you can get the tram to and from the station instead, this goes to all the major touristy bits. The transport system is amazing so you should not worry about getting around just because you are a little way out of town. As for the hotel - relaxing, peaceful, helpful staff (who do speak english). Split level studio type rooms with views of the city, an excellent restaurant with great food and extremely helpful waiters (Ceklar deserves a mention as he was great, helped us out, nothing was too much trouble and was really friendly). The breakfast buffet is brilliant, pile as much on your plate as you like, it's all nice food as well not the normal tat you would expect with a buffet type affair!! The restaurant is split as there is a terrace room where you can enjoy views of Vienna while you dine. You'll find that the locals smoke like chimneys and the terrace room would be the nominated smoking area, Im a none smoker myself but it is worth putting up with it to enjoy the views. My wife and I both really enjoyed our stay in Vienna and a major contributor to this was where we stayed. If you are looking for night life and the bright lights of the city then look elsewhere, but if you are looking to chill then head for Schloss Wilhelminenberg for an enjoyable experience.", "title": "Go, Chill Out, Enjoy......", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "adethomp", "date": "April 14, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 1785048}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice, but not amazing.", "text": "I just returned from Austria, where we stayed at this castle. While we found the hotel to be very quaint, and quite impressive, it was DEFINITELY off the beaten path. If that is what you're looking for, than this place will be right up your ally, but if you like to check out sights, and then come home and shower/nap before going out to dinner, you may want to chose somewhere a little closer to the city center. The restaurant at the castle was very good, and they were very helpful.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "April 12, 2004", "id": 1775527}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Schloss Wilhelminenberg-Heaven on Earth!", "text": "We stayed in the hotel for 8 days in early August. It is an absolutely beautiful hotel. The building is very grand and is white in colour on the outside. It looks just like a castle or palace. On the inside it is very large and just as lovely. Although it is big, it still feels cosy and welcoming, and not at all cold. You are greeted by the lovely people on reception. Most of them have excellent English and are extremely nice and helpful. The restaurant staff are also polite and welcoming. The cuisine is excellent and the meals, if not always large in quantity are certainly made up for in superb quality and taste, we had half-pension which was again brilliant. There is plenty of room in the restaurant, there is a large dining hall, a little corridor with tables in and a lovely terrace, also with many tables. I would advise you eat on the terrace if it is warm enough- the views are fantastic- you get to see all over Vienna- it is so beautiful. There are also about 30 acres of grounds where you can walk or play mini-golf etc. The rooms are spacious and are also very stylish, cosy and beautiful in keeping with the rest of the decor. They are large, although the bathrooms could do with being slightly larger. In the back rooms you get a beautiful view of Vienna, just like from the restaurant terrace. From the front you can see the cleverly done \"SW\" shaped hedge in the middle of the front lawn. The hotel is located at the top of the hill which accounts for the views and the minimal if any noise. It is a beautiful place to relax if you don't fancy going out. I am definitely going there again.", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 25, 2002", "id": 681959}], "location": {"country": "Austria", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 10, "average": 22, "very good": 49, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 45}, "aka": "Austria Trend Vienna", "slim_ranking": 0.402777777778, "description": "The hotel offers noble ambience in stylish & representative rooms, built in the Neo-Empire style."}
