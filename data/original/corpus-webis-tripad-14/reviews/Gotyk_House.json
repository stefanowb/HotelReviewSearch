In the snow it looked so picturesque on arrival and the staff were always so friendly and to be of assistance. We were then when it was bitterly cold with a VERY keen wind and they were obviously having some problems with the heating. However, the rooms were great and we were given oil filled radiators in case we were not warm enough, together with cups of tea and coffee and the most delicious gingerbread (which can be purchased in the downstairs shop/museum /cafe). If you want a big posh modern hotel this is not for you but if you like small, friendly, decent continental breakfast, comfortable rooms in the centre of things this is the place for you. Nothing was too much trouble - ideas of which restaurant to eat in (and there are many good ones nearby) and which attractions to visit (some of which were not in the guide books). Because of a cancelled homeward flight we got a taxi back to Gotyk House and they took pity on us (and luckily they had cancellations because of the bad weather) and we ended up staying for an extra two nights.
