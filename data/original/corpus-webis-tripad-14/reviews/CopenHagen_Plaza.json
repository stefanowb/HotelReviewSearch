The good points; right next to the central train station so need for a taxi from the airport. Check in was swift, easy and efficient. The lift is a bit quaint but at least it has one. The room is clean and tidy though very worn (loads of scuff marks in the paintwork and along the walls, the bed-spead is so worn it has many holes in it. Despite this the linens are fresh. A bit bizarre for a Brit but the double bed comes with two single duvets. Works for me as the wife could not steal my half. Rooms have WIFI and it works though you have to log in each time and it is slow - I stayed on 3G in the end. Very central location. Literally next door to Tivoli gardens and all the key sights are within walking distance of the hotel. We did not use one taxi while in Copenhagen.

It was clean. There were several closets, which was great because we had several suitcases to put away. There was a mini fridge, and it wasn't one of those that cost something if you lift up an item, this was more of an honor system, you wrote down what you used and tell them later. The breakfast buffet was free and offered the standard breakfast. Breads and coldcuts, some fruit and hot offerings of eggs and bacon. Also yogurt. It was busy and I did notice a shortage of forks, and had to wait, but it wasn't too long a wait. I was able to find tea, I saw one review that said no tea, but I did find some. I would stay again.
