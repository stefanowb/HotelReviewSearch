The owners go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy you stay, they are warm and friendly. The gardens are lovely with flowers and herbs. I enjoyed sitting out in the garden when I could.

Murphy should of gone into map making, he definately knows his maps and directions, not to mention his extensive history of the area.

The garden is so beautiful, but with such a warmness to it. Our rooms' window overlooked this garden and had a settee underneath the window so we could get the afternoon sun and look out over the view. Breakfast was an absolute delight, and it was like mom calling all the family down for the sitting. I think that this is the type of place you want to go to, if you want that quaint, homecooked type of feel. Alot of time and effort has been put into it to give it that.

Typically, we've had our own table, or had hours where we could have breakfast between (i.e. show up anytime between 8 and 10). Ey and Alice do it much differently for a unique experience. They have a large table for all the guests and breakfast starts promptly at 9. Once all the guests are seated, Ey serves each guest a hot drink (coffee, tea or hot cocoa). He serves the first dish which I gather is typically a pastry of some sort (we had oatmeal creme brulee with fresh cranberries), then everyone gets juice/water. Then a fruit plate is served (we had strawberries and canteloupe). Finally, the entree - a mix of sweet and savory. We had pumpkin pancakes with whipped cream, toasted pumpkin seeds, fresh syrup, and canadian bacon. It's an interesting experience as all the guests get to know each other, Ey makes for a delightful host as he discusses various topics and sets with mood with CD's of the guests' choosing, and Alice's food is just fantastic.
