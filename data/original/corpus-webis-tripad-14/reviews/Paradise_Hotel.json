This one hit both perfectly, walking distance to the central train station (which we walked to upon our departure), walking distance to the university, Due Torre, etc. Our room was simple and sparse but the A/C worked (it was so hot that week!), it was clean and safe, bathroom was small but functional (seems consistent with other hotels we stayed at) and the breakfast was nice but nothing phenomenal. We were especially pleased with the front desk staff (I'm sorry I don't know her name) but we came in via rental car and needed to drop it off - because the hotel is in the no car zone (ZTL I think) we were really concerned about getting a ticket - she gave us perfectly clear directions about how to get to Hertz. We also bought train tickets via the DB website and needed to print them out - no problem just email them to her and she printed them for us. Really nice and helpful!
