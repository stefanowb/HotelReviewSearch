Other reviews suggest that it is ideal location and that it is a great place to stay - I only agree with the location. The motel (it is not a hotel) simply looks like it is stuck in the 1960's and needs a thorough clean up and refurbishment. The rooms are small, with two beds squeezed in to accommodate families who seem to be the main customers. The rooms were also of poor quality in terms of furnishings - the bed was a sponge on wheels.
