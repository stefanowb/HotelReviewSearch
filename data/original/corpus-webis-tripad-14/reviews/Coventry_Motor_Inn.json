That and the other advantage of off street parking included - which was a major thing as parking in SF is extremely limited and expensive - $30/day. The room was spacious, clean and the beds were comfy - make sure you ask for extra pillows as they are pretty flat. Had no problem getting into and out of the car park, even with our rental trailblazer - always had spaces available in the basement park.
