Very efficient very Japanese-great. To be honest most people I assume will be spending long days in the park returning just to sleep & bathe. All the hotels looked of a similar standard although this one had 2 great pools (indoor & outdoors) & a great kids play area with family amusements(shove a penny etc) for some strange reason pools & kids play area are an additional charge for hotel guests in Japan although in our case it was inc. in a special room rate package.Downside was an old bathroom & eating in the hotel was not good quality or value. The shuttle train to Disney is not free although the bus to the train station is .For some reason Disney was full but Disney sea empty(very nice) I would stay in the park Disney Sea is the rate is similar but we were quoted triple the Sheraton.", "title": "worth a stay", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "familymanHongKong", "date": "October 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10277216, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 pool", "disliked": "\u2014 bathroom"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "Fantastic hotel - very accommodating & helpful.
