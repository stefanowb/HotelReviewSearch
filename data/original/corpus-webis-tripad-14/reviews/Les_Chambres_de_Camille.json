The room was very cute - we had the red one and the bed was OK. We stayed in Bordeaux to go on a wine tour and although I don't think that they have a listing on trip advisor we took one called \"Tours 33\" and it was as wonderful as the B & B. There are not any restaurants close to the B&B but take my word for it and do not be afraid to take the tram which is only a 4 or 5 minute walk down the street and gets you right to the heart of Bordeaux.

We did not have any problem finding free parking on nearby streets. The rooms are newly renovated to a very high standard. Breakfast was excellent with home made bread and cakes every day. It is served in the dining room giving you a good opportunity to talk to the other guests. This was the first time we stayed in a B&B in France but based on the expericence from this and other B&B's we stayed in on this trip we will definitely prefer to stay in B&B's on future trips to France.", "title": "You won't find a better B&B in Bordeaux", "user": "frch-Denmark", "date": "April 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 129035566}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We just got back from France and had a wonderful trip.
