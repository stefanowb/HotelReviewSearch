So even though its a good 30 minutes out from Nashville, it was quite busy. There was not a vacant room in the place. Infact, they were having to send people hours away for a room somewhere else. That being said, the service was great for a fully booked hotel. When we arrived our room wasn't ready yet and the friendly girl at the front desk offered us information on where we could go eat in the area. The breakfast staff was also wonderful. And when we would come in late at night from all the festivies, everyone greeted us with a smile. The rooms are nicely decorated in all modern finishes. My only complaint was that the room did not seem as clean as other hampton inns I have stayed in. This could be because they were booked solid, but still this is something you expect. My pillows were dirty with what looked to be make up when we arrived in our room. Also, the bathroom needed to be cleaned. Overall, we had a nice stay though.", "title": "Nice Hotel, Friendly Staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "stylizpinkangel", "date": "July 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 70742818}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Was here for 2 nights on business.

When I arrived I was exhausted and as I checked in the attendant was friendly and was expecting me. I was given a key card and told where my room was located. The following morning we were met by the NICEST lady that I believe has ever been in the hotel industry, Gwen, she was the cook/kitchen staff/clean up crew all in one. Saturday we were in a hurry to get to our event and even though we had eaten she sent us with \"to go\" breakfast since we were eating so early. She also took special care with my 19 month old son and told us that Sunday she would have eggs, biscuits, and gravy for him. The next morning when we went down we were again greeted by her smile and hospitality. I had an issue with the free wireless internet and tried to fix the problem myself, after an hour I went downstairs at around midnight and told the desk clerk that there was a problem with the internet. She was quick to connect me to an on-call person and they walked me through the set up and within ten minutes I was surfing again.

As noted before, be sure and ask for a room \"away from traffic noise\" or you will be almost on I-40. The Hampton Directory indicated this hotel had an \"indoor\" pool. When we originally made this reservation, even their website indicated an indoor pool (although this has been corrected since). There is no indoor pool. We chose this hotel based on the pool - it has only an outdoor pool and it was closed for the season when we stayed here. While this is a small complaint, compared to the other fine qualities of this hotel, if this is important to you, then you should be aware. The restaurant options are an Outback Restaurant just across the parking lot. Overall, our stay here was very enjoyable. The staff is helpful and upbeat - - I am not sure how Hampton does this, but their personnel is always most pleasant! One thing I have noticed is that the standard rooms at Hamptons have poor lighting in the bathrooms. The upgraded rooms and suites have better lighting.", "title": "Beautiful Hotel, but no indoor pool", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ninjaqueen", "date": "October 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 46519714}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled on business", "text": "We loved the new Hampton Inn.
