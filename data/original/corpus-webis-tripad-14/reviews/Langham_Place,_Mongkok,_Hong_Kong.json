Access to the members lounge well worth it, had a few drinks there every night and some food after tours and shopping. Breakfast is better in the main area but much busier than the lounge. Loved the luxury but being left alone at the same time. Buy an Oyster card, well worth it. Not really worth getting the train up the Peak as you can't see anything. You can use your Oyster card on the star ferry and then get a bus to the Peak - better than making your way into town, walking and joining the long queue for this short journey.

The concierge team were fantastic and the whole of the ground floor reception staff were efficient and always happy and accommodating. The spa, pool and amenities were fantastic and the breakfasts were amazing. I love this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again.
