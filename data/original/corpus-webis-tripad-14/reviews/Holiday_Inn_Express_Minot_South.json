I chose it because it was close to all of the major shopping areas, but was more than pleasantly suprised at what a great facility it is. It is a fairly new hotel, (it still had that fresh, new smell). The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. Our room was immaculately clean, as was the rest of the hotel. It was decorated nicely and modernly. There was no skimping on anything,.the pillows were perfect, in fact there were four on the bed, two labelled soft, two labelled firm(embroidered right onto the pillowcases), the bed itself was firm, but very comfortable(easily comparable to those in more expensive hotels). There were ample towels that were thick and plush, the shower/tub had a curved rod that fit right around the top of the enclosure, so that there was no water leaks or drafts possible. The showerhead was extra wide so that even with the flow control you felt like you had ample water. The lighting in the bathroom was very good; perfect for makeup application (which is rare in most hotels). The price was more than reasonable. My only negative point is that the air conditioning/heating unit was a bit noisy when it cut in during the night. We will definitely stay here again.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Travellers007", "date": "September 15, 2007", "id": 8717001}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Minot"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 5, "very good": 18, "terrible": 4, "excellent": 19}, "aka": "Holiday Inn Express Minot South Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.548387096774, "description": "Our Comfortable Minot, ND Hotel Offers Convenience and Relaxation Ideally located just off Highway 83, our comfortable and convenient Minot hotel provides easy access to the Minot International Airport (MOT), so that you can go to and from your destinations quickly and easily.
