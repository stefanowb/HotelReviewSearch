They were as friendly and helpful as could be. I called them and asked about the windowless rooms, and they said that if, upon arrival, there were partial or ocean view rooms available, they would upgrade us for less money than it would be if we booked a partial or ocean view room in advance. It added a little excitement to the experience and when we arrived that was precisely the case. They offered to upgrade us to a partial ocean view for $10 more a night, or to a full ocean view for $20 a night (as opposed to I think $80 if we booked an ocean view in advance.)", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 20, 2004", "id": 2477806}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Boutique must mean something else in the USA", "text": "As other reviewers have said, this hotel lacks bells and whistles, but my thoughts are that in Waikiki you don't need your hotel to have bells and whistles.

We read the other reviews and we were expecting to be disappointed, but once we got there, we were quite relieved. The room was small but it was fine for two people. Yes, there were no windows but it didn't really matter to us since we were hardly in the room anyways. The major perk for this hotel is its location, location, location. It is right across the kuhio beach (part of waikiki beach) and closed to everything. The zoo is just a few blocks away and so was the international market. Most of the trolleys make a stop in front of the duke statue, and most of our tour pick ups were behind the Hyatt Hotel on Koa Ave which is only one block away. Yes, it is a small hotel with no restuarant or pools but their service was excellent. Trevor and Shane provided a lot of good advices about tours and transportation and most of the staff were helpful and friendly.

No swimming pool but there's the beach and boogie boarding and surfing lessons right there in front. Get your Maui Babe suntan lotion and feast on the sun tanning opportunity. The view was superb from our balcony. The free continental breakfast was great and with the bed tray, you can bring the muffins, croissants, coffee and juice (real!) up to your room. This is a small boutique hotel with friendly staff and location, location, location! We got a great room with a great view but yes some rooms are without windows or look out onto a wall. Get out of the room and see Oahu and the North Shore and the malls and just sleep in there! You're not buying the place but just sleeping there.
