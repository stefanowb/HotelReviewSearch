I had booked the one bedroom suite but then wished I\u2019d chosen the two bedroom as I did think the extra bedroom/bathroom would have been better with two daughters but I can quite honestly say at no point while on holiday did I feel cramped. Our suite was on the third floor facing in, overlooking the pool. The huge double bed along with the total absence of any road / other guest noise gave us the most restful nights sleep I\u2019ve ever had in any hotel. The girls also found their sofa bed to be very comfy and it took all of two minutes to make up and put away. The suite was a little tired but it\u2019s overall comfort and amenities more than made up for a few scuffed walls and slightly ageing appliances. Iron, ironing board, hairdryer, free digital safe, Full size fridge/freezer, dishwasher, full size oven/hob, toaster, microwave, coffee percolator and even a bedside clock radio is provided. The free buffet breakfast was a great boon. The breakfast was self-service and each day there was one hot egg product, omelette plain/cheese or scrambled egg and one hot meat product, bacon or ham, sausage or even corn beef hash one day. Everyday there was four types of cereal + porridge, fresh fruit salad, yoghurt, bagels, boiled egg, various cakes make your own waffles and toast and unpeeled fresh fruit, four types of fruit juice, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, cold milk. There was something for everyone and as much as you liked, they even provided disposable plates/cutlery for in case you wished to eat in your room or on the go. Three evenings a week the hotel held a little sun-downer where they served a free snack/meal and either wine, beer or a soft drink. We were usually out so only partook once and then we had hotdogs with chilli beans. Within a very short walk there is a sizzlers, steak and shake, Italian restaurant, set price Chinese buffet and just about every other eating place you can think of within a very, very short drive. We did soon get a bit tired of eating out ( sad I know ) and so shopped at the huge Wal-Mart a few miles down the road, so cheap!!. There is a small hotel shop but they don\u2019t stock much so the wall greens across the road were handy. The hotel pool isn\u2019t large but quite adequate and they provide free pool towels and pool inflatables. There is a small gym, free towels once again, a small games room for the kids with a few arcade type machines and one computer for their use. They have a free business centre room in the hotel with three computers and a printer for adult use only. A laundry room is available at a small charge through a token machine, I would take a few washing powder/liquid tablets next time though as I wasn\u2019t keen on the token meter dispensed powder. We didn\u2019t use the free shuttle buses to the Disney parks so can\u2019t comment, though the hotels nearness to Disney and its provision of transport was one of the reasons we booked here. Originally we weren\u2019t going to have a hire car but were persuaded by friends to make use of the included car hire, which came with our holiday package, and we are so very, very glad we did. My husband is a fairly confident driver in the U.K and except for a few understandable first panicky nerves we managed to drive all over Florida and covered 1600miles. We barely went to the parks in the end as there is so much more to see and do in Florida We did hire a sat nav but returned it the day after and saved $130 as we really didn\u2019t need it. Once you get the hang of all roads run roughly east/west or north/south and remember that going the wrong way is all part of the experience and what\u2019s the rush anyway? You\u2019re on holiday it just adds to the fun.", "title": "lovely holiday", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "tatty-teddy", "date": "May 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7564742, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 homely and relaxing and fully equiped with all you could need and very comfy beds", "disliked": "\u2014 Rooms begining to look a little tired."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with family", "text": "One thing I wished I had brought or bought in the first few days would have been another cooler.

We booked through West Jet Vacations and got a reasonable package deal and were really impressed with the hotel. We had a 2 bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms a kitchen with a full size fridge stove microwave and even a dishwasher.The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. THe pool was very nice although we only used it once as we were on the go the whole time lots of loungers and towels. The grounds very well kept. The buffet breakfast was wonderful even for fussy eaters like my kids they found plenty to chose from. We did not use the shuttle system as we rented a car since we have small children and did not want to have to wait for a shuttle. I did look at the shuttle schedule and it did look like it ran on a regular basis. This hotel is in a great location just 15-20 min away from the 4 disney parks and downtown disney. There were plenty of restaurants near by and also a Winn Dixie across the street which was handy to purchase drinks and groceries if you wanted to cook. We booked our disney passes with ticketmania they have a web site and got a bit of a better price than getting then from Disney I think we saved the tax which is a big savings when purchasing 5 tickets. We had them deliver them to our hotel the day we arrived which was only an additional $6.00 and they were there waiting for us with a welcome package with loads of info. We also booked a make over for my daughter 6 years old at the Bibbity Boppity Boutique which we booked a few months ahead this was worth every penny for $45.00 she got the crown package which includes a hairstyle which includes hair piece hair accessories makeup and nails by a fairy god mother in training. She wore her own Belle Costume so we did not purchase one there. THis is an amazing experience for little girls they are made to feel like little princesses. We also went for a photoshoot and purchased 5 pictures for $30.00 and they are beautiful they did a wonderful job. After the make over we went to Epcot the Norwegian Pavilion Akerishus for Story Book Dining and had dinner which was also booked ahead of time. Belle Jasmine Princess Aurora and Cinderella were there they stopped at each table to sign autographs and have photos taken with your children a great experience.
