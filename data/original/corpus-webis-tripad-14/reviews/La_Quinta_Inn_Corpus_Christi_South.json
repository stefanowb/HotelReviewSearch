But we paid twice what we would normally pay for a hotel of similar quality, and that was really frustrating. Yes, I think this hotel had better decor than your average Econo lodge, but the mold on the shower ceiling still showed through (despite an attempt to glop paint on the top of it.) This kind of thing is not a big deal to me for one night, but it is kind of irritating considering the price. I really don't know why the price was so high--I thought it was because it was a Friday night in the summer, but checked on Friday night prices for July (that's next month!) and those rates were about half.", "title": "Not worth the money", "user": "MaggieP6789", "date": "June 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 165123529}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013", "text": "First room we were given, the TV and the phone didn't work.

This time around from the 1st to 4th day we were sorely disappointed. Complimentary Breakfast served out of Room 105 due to tile work being done in lobby area. 3 tables crammed in to a hotel room says it all. Tile workers were in no hurry to finish the job. No housekeeping service on Thanksgiving day really threw us for a loop as eating in our room due to the breakfast room being too crowded left us with alot of trash in the trash can and some spilled coffee on one of the beds. Also we noticed small ant looking bugs in the room the day we arrived; mainly on the walls and bathroom area. They didn't bite the kids but it gives you the creeps when you get ready for bed and start to think they may be in your bed as well. Our last day (we leave really early in the morning) my husband checked with staff the night before to ensure there would be enough coffee to fill his thermos and mug. Go to checkout and are advised no coffee.

I was appalled at the condition of the motel. As we walked to our room we noticed how dingy the walls were and all the trash in the flower beds. On entering our room we noticed an odor which I can't describe. The room was well worn. The tub and commode was sectioned off in a very tiny area by a door. There was mildew around the soap holder and along the ceiling above the tub. and the corners of the floor was filthy. To dress you had to step out into the sink basin area which was opened to the bedroom. There was no refridgerator, microwave or coffe pot although there was coffee packets on the table. However the staff promptly brought a coffee pot when we contacted them. The morning breakfast was not at all enticing so we ate elsewhere. I would not recomend this motel to anyone. In all fairness I must say that La Quinta is by far my favorite place to stay when traveling and we have stayed in some exceptional La Quinta Inn's. There are newer La Quinta Inn's in Corpus Christi although they are not as convient for us but for sure I will not stay at this motel again.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 13, 2012", "id": 145314611}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012", "text": "Oeiginally booked because of low price.
