We walked everywhere which was nice. THey let us look at two rooms to decide what we wanted. All the rooms ranged from $65-85. We looked at a two story townhome and a tower suite. We decided on the tower suite, despite the fact it was smaller, it was cleaner and had more natural light. The couch was a bit old, and the bed could have been a little more comfortable (granted we DID just come from the Lodge at Buckberry! and paid 3X's the amount!) but for the price, it is a nice and easy hotel. Great if you have kids b/c it has a lot of room and close to everything.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 27, 2005", "id": 4305507}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful experience", "text": "They had coffee and Krispy Kreme doughnuts for us in the morning with a HUGE fireplace in the lobby to enjoy it by.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 7, 2005", "id": 4092457}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2005", "text": "Great downtown location - can walk everywhere.

The hotel staff was wonderful, the rooms were so clean and the shower felt nice. We fully intend on staying there again.

Room was clean, and overlooked the pool, which was nice. Staff very friendly at check in and check out. The room was supposed to have a king bed up in the loft, but instead had 2 double beds. I didn't complain about it even though we would rather have the king bed. On the minus side -- one of the couches had a couple of small holes on the armrest and both bedspreads did look a bit old and outdated and there were patched places in the carpet that weren't glued down, and would come up if you scuffed your shoe across it. Plus side -- there were plenty of towels, and the kitchen area had a refridgerator, microwave, stove, plates, glasses and silverware. It was nice to be in the center of town, easy access to everything. I would stay here again. If they would replace the carpet, and update the bedspreads and couch, this place would be Awesome!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jl0630", "date": "July 5, 2005", "id": 3636008}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "great hotel", "text": "i have stayed at Midtown Lodge several times and it has always been great.
