We felt it was a very good deal. the SMS hotel also has its own garden and a small swimming pool where we found a beautiful peacock. My little son really enjoyed it. As we were a member of taj hotel, we could get upgrade to a suite room. We stayed a standard room on the first night which was also nice. The restaurant was bit quiet. Nobody was there.
