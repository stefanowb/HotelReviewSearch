We had a faimily room on the 6th floor, we were pleasantly surprised because it had 2 separate rooms, a twin beded room and a kingsize bedroom and a large bathroom with a fantastic shower. We also had 2 balconies overlooking the sea and pool and also a TV in each bedroom. We stayed half board and the food was nice with a large choice for breakfast and evening meal. The dinning room could get quite hectic at breakfast time especially at weekends, but for some reason at evening meal time, the restaurant was virtuallly empty. There was always plenty of choice and the restaurant staff were very friendy especially Kathrine the waitress from Palma who couldnt speak English but always made so much fuss of us, especially my son.", "user": "KCB81", "date": "August 13, 2007", "id": 8405413}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Dirty nasty three star at best", "text": "The pool area was always clean and you could usually get a bed at any time of the day.

On Mondays and Wednesdays they had a organist and singer, but unfortunately no one seem to support this and it fell very flat!! Outside the hotel there were a only a dozen or so bars/restaurants unless you walked down to the marina (15 mins walk) then there was lots of choice. It was very up market and the yachts were something you would dream about. There was a beach the other side of the marina which was quite small but nice and clean, but this got very packed at the weekend.", "user": "nichola53", "date": "August 5, 2007", "id": 8353885}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "No room when we arrived!", "text": "Be very careful at this hotel, we arrived here at 1am and was told they had no room for us, the man on reception was very rude and said this happens all the time (very worrying!), he wouldn't even let us use the phone to call our holiday company. We had to go to another hotel about 10 mins away and then come back the next day, when we arrived back at 10am, our room still wasn't ready we had to wait until 12noon, the reason we got a late flight was so we had the whole day to relax and sit in the sun! Best plans never work! They ended up upgrading us to half board for the inconvenience but that would have cost them nothing. The hotel to my standard was not a 4 star, everything was clean etc but very basic. Its in a nice location, a few shops and restaurants outside and about 10 mins walk to the port. Would be nervous about recommending this hotel to families incase the same happened to you, but otherwise the hotel was fine.", "user": "HolidayqueenEssex", "date": "August 3, 2007", "id": 8284007}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Fantastic", "text": "This was our first time staying at this hotel and i would recommend it to anyone, we got a great deal with Alpharooms so much so i was quite worried as to what state the accommodation would be in, i checked out the hotel online and looked quite ok but some of the reviews made me panic because i booked for my 8 friends as well... the hotel is a little dated in the reception area and some of the rooms but what i can say is the hotel is extreamly clean from the reception to the pool to the rooms and the breakfast room, which i think is very important, what dealings i had with staff they were friendly. As for the breakfast i thought it was great, all you can eat buffet it had hot and cold food.. fresh fruit to a fry up (although the spanish sausages were to be desired) fresh pastries to cold meats and from Coffee to Champagne ! it was all there and varied each day, i lapped it up ! We only stayed B&B so i can only comment on Breakfast.

We were a little concerned after reading some of the reviews that gave this hotel a poor rating. However we arrived with an open mind. The Hotel was very clean, well presented and well organised, we arrived at 5am and had telephoned in advance to let them know of our late arrival. Everything was ready for us and we were quickly checked into our room by the friendly staff (no bell boys though). The room and bathroom were good with plenty of storage, king size bed, TV wth only the news channel in English. Air con was not very good. Nice balcony with limited views of the Mediteranian and the mountains west facing. Breakfast was buffett style the hot food not to good but the cold selection and fruits were very good.", "user": "babygrey", "date": "May 21, 2007", "id": 7665961}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "A little dated", "text": "Bottles of bubbly for making a bucks fizz and very attentive staff. The coffee is something I would not recommend, its a vending type machine! The grounds of the hotel are very pleasant with trees shrubs and lawns all well tended and manicured. The pool is great, good depth and large enough for lots of people the temperature is for the hardy (not heated) so its usually free to have a good swim. There are also a couple of childrens pools and a play area for the kids. Table tennis, crazy golf, pool tables and volley ball is all on hand in the grounds. The bar and restaraunt is very good for lunch and drinks throught the day. Outside is a ten min walk to the marina with fantastic yachts, bars, restaraunts, top of the range cars driving in the area and designer shops, great for people watching and chilling out with a drink. Just outside the hotel there are purpose constructed walkways which go for miles, safe for jogging, cycling, roller skating and play areas for children. I think this hotel is a real gem with lots to do nearby. 30 euros taxi from the airport, 1.35 euros to Palma City by bus. Great for families, golfers, and people just wanting a rest in the sun for a few days. We used the courtesy room for shower and changing which is okay. The Gym is not very well equiped. Check out was very good, no suprises or problems with the final account.
