This was the Bates Motel part 2. The room was filthy: blood on the matress, no hot water, cigarette burns on the carpet, blankets and bedspread and infestation of bugs due to a large hole in the window screen. We complained to the management and they acted like they were disinterested. They advertised TV with cable channels and all we got was one local channel that was predominately snowy. The bed was so uncomfortable that we had three sleepless nights. We are ready for another vacation to recover from this nightmare of a stay.", "user": "nceewilliams", "date": "October 11, 2007", "id": 10069251}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "2nd Time Not a Charm", "text": "This was our second stay at Wintergreen.

The Bar & lounge was not open, due to a wedding in the banquet room, which isnt near the bar area, and of course this was a private wedding. Which I have no complaints, but why have a Bar on the property for all guests, and not be open to the one's who were singled out?... as for the Dinning?... forget it, that wasnt open either, we had to go elsewhere to eat. The whole Idea I choose this Hotel was the Bar & resturant on the property. I didnt want to have to drink & drive around the Dells area On a Saturday Night.... I do not recommend this hotel, I was not happy... Also.... You can't use the phones in your room, unless you either have a credit card, or a 20.00 deposit. I had a calling card, to call my son, and had to find a pay phone to use. And to top it off, the bathroom light bulb was burnt out, I called the front desk. ( NO CHARGE).. to bring a bulb, the woman who brought it didnt know how to change a lightbulb...SO I stood on the toilet and changed it....
