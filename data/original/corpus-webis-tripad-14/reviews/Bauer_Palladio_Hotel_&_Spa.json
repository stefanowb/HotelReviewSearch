The price we paid was great for the refined grandeur of the Palladio. I'm a flight attendant and i stay in many 4* hotels and i can certainly see the difference between them and this 5*. Anything we asked for was provided without fuss and the hotel really had a feeling of exclusivity about it (2 doors down from Elton John). We didn't use the restuarant, spa or bar as we were only on a short break and wanted to get into VCE and the lagoon. The breakfast was european in style and the staff attentive. The reception manager and the housekeeping staff were exceptional. The room we had was spotless and spacious. Must less stuffy than the sister hotels over the water in which we felt somewhat uncomfortable.
