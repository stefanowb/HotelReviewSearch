We were sooooo excited to stay at the Westin again...maybe our expectations were too high. Our first room did smell like mildew, so they changed our room. That was nice. We asked to be upgraded but it was a no go, they said they were too booked (we are starwood members). I am a little annoyed as I write this and see that someone else was upgraded. Regardless, bed and shower were amazing. Pool was nice, beach is beautiful. When we arrived, unlike other guests, we did not receive the activity guide. Luckily, we bumped into a lady on the beach who told us how to get a hut so we could have some shade. The towel lady has absolutely no customer service and the concierge was not that great either. My husband tried to book a trip on the Black Pearl and concierge said they were not allowed to assist because they could only book through De Palm. Do you work for the hotel or De Palm a total conflict of interest!!! Do not eat at Cafe Baci $20 all you can eat pizza and pasta, it was disgusting!!! I read reviews about this Chef Sebastian but he must be in Italy for the month of August and he clearly did not leave his recIpes. During our stay the elevator broke so they gave out some free food which was gobbled up in about 45 minutes they needed to replace some of the food. Also on the beach there are like no servers, only 1-2, they need like 10 people out there to see if people want food or drink. Overall, I think they are understaffed. We will not stay there again if we return to Aruba.", "title": "Not the Westin's best", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "littledphie", "date": "August 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 171968816}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My family and I stayed at the Westin for a week in July for my cousins wedding.

But ,this is not as dangerous as sitting on the balcony on the 18th floor, going to return to the room & have the handle snap off in your hands. Luckily my husband had been inside the room at that time. Scarier still, an employee said it was the 3rd time it happened that week, this is a highrise hotel folks ! Things were fixed the next day, I believe due to the excellent customer service I received from the front desk associate Dany Nieto. Dany seemed appropriately appalled by the very dangerouse situation we were put in. I ran into Dany off site from the hotel at a wedding event, and he approached both my husband & I on his free time to let us know where everything stood. The wedding planner was also responsive, but we felt that her hands were tied with the unfulfilled promises made at booking, and not followed thru with by the Hotel Management . Westin, these were the only stars in our stay with you.

I was a bit concerned staying there because of some of the reviews I read, but we were pleasantly surprised. ROOM/SERVICE: We are SPG platinum members and as soon as we arrived we were upgraded to a junior suit. The room was nice and clean, no mildew smell as other reviews suggested (we were in room 1200, which had 2 balconies and the best ocean view). The room was cleaned well everyday and yes there may have been a chip on the tile floor and some chips in the paint on the wall but that definitely didn\u2019t out way all of the positives with our stay. Other reviews mentioned the hotel\u2019s elevators being slow. This was true and in fact one day the hotel\u2019s elevators went down for a few hours forcing everyone to used the service elevators, or if you didn\u2019t want to wait take the stairs. The hotel made up for this inconvenience by giving each guest a personal letter apologizing for the incident, as well as extending happy hour by another hour the next day, making it 3 hour. They also handed out free hors d\u2019oeuvres during the happy hour and also passed out coupons for a $50 credit that could be used at the hotel casino. The hotel definitely did their job and made up for the elevator issue. If possible definitely request a room not facing the Riu so that you can get an ocean view. BEACH: The beach was great and very clean. We never rented the palapas but we placed our chair under the trees on the left side of the beach (when facing the ocean) for shade. POOL: The pool was nice, but since it is very windy in Aruba, there may be a lot of leaves in the pool depending on the day. Also some of the cushions on the pool area beach chair were a bit gross since if someone was sitting there before you the cushions would be wet, therefore thet definitely needed to be covered with a towel before sitting down. FOOD: We ate at The Terrace almost everyday for lunch, since it was so convenient being so close to the beach. The food was good and they had decent prices, $13-$15 for a sandwich/ burger with fries, and a bit more for a full meal. We also ate at Caf\u00e9 Baci at the hotel on our first night. We arrived late and weren\u2019t that hungry so we just grabbed a few appetizers (the food and service was good. We never ate breakfast at the hotel, it was too expensive for what they were offering ($14 for continental breakfast). If you want a good breakfast I would suggest going to a place down the street called 5 burgers. They have eggs, toast and coffee combo starting at $4.99 and they have everything else including pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausage and breakfast potatoes. The owner is very nice and friendly and will greet you warmly everyday. It is about 5 minute walk from the hotel in the direction of the Riu. I would definitely suggest going to Amore Mio Pizzeria. The food and service was so amazing there we ate there twice on our trip. They serve gourmet style pizzas and you can definitely share 1 pizza and an appetizer for 2 people. Amore Mio is a definite must. Also right beside the Pizzeria is a Gelato place called Gelatissimo. They had amazingly delicious and fresh gelato flavors and without fail we went there every night after dinner. One more suggestion if you are interested in going into town you can take the bus for $2.25 or if you are more people it is better and cheaper to take a taxi which was $11 to go into town. When we went into town we ate at Iguana joes, which was sports bar type food with a Caribbean twist, everything we ate there was great. All in all I had a great vacation, as other reviews said, it may not be the Westin's best property around the world,but we had a great experience there and i would definitely return to the Westin Aruba.", "user": "dpgesq97", "date": "August 10, 2013", "id": 171622047}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We just returned from a week in Aruba and the Westin was the perfect choice for my family. from the moment we arrived we were welcomed by the staff and began to enjoy our stay.

I have to say that the pool area and beach were great and clean. Our room was big and comfortable and the partial ocean view was excellent!!! I just felt like the hotel was comparable to an old hotel in Panama City Beach or Myrtle Beach. The Aruba Ocean though made up for that. Wow beautiful beach. Location was pretty good too. Go out walk 700 yards and you are at all the best places to eat. Going to beach or pool your first day very frustrating because all the umbrellas have been sold or given away the day before so there is no chance to get shade first day. Nice lady filled us in on how to get one free by waiting in line day before at 3. Not that bad to do this but I ended up paying for our spot. Service was okay. More nice people then indifferent people but close. We enjoyed our visit because Aruba is so safe and you can walk around most places and that was so fun. We will visit again but will probably stay elsewhere and pay a little more to be away from crowd even in the off season. Recommend room service breakfast bc its cheaper and you don't have to fight crazy lines at the breakfast place. You get same food just not all you can eat. Elevators were very very slow so if you stay here you will want to be on a lower floor so your wait is not as long and I do mean long waits for the elevators.

First they gave us a room on a lower level floor(if I remember correctly it was on the 4th floor) and it had a really bad mildew smell. We went back down to the front desk and they gave us a room on the 11th floor while there was slightly less odor it still smelled like mildew, at that point I didn't want to back down and complain again. You basically have to keep the A/C at about 60-65 to minimize the mildew smell and we all ended up sick at the end of our stay and went back home with a horrible nasal congestion. The only good thing about the room was the bed, it was very comfortable. The last night(or maybe it was the morning before, I can't remember correctly) before check-out they slipped the final bill under our room door and we learned we were being charged all sorts of extra fees, from the daily maid cleaning(we didn't even get our room cleaned every day while we were there) to the bellhop(we took our own luggages to our room). We went to the front desk to speak to someone and they told us these were fees we had agreed to upon check-in and had signed a contract. I stated that upon check-in I never was told of these fees, nor was I given anything stating these fees would be applied and that I had never even signed a contract with the hotel(I booked through the wedding planner, and she never informed me of these fees as well). I asked them to show me the contract, which of course didn't exist. At this point I was so upset and asked to speak to a manager, the front desk person went to a back room and came back a few minutes later(the manager didn't even show) he said the charges would be taken off our bill. Good thing we payed cash for our stay and we didn't have to deal with credit card charges. We've traveled to many different places(a lot less expensive than the Westin) and we've always been very satisfied but we left with a very bad taste from our experience here.
