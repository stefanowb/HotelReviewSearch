When we were in our room we called for the luggage and as they came up they brought us the wrong luggage...then when they came back 2nd time they had lost one luggage and couldn't find it. We had plan to go to the aquarium which you could purchased tickets there. I asked at check in if we could purchase at that time he said sales manager not available and would be in next day..no problem of getting them ( I reassure him if that was the case and he said no problem). Next day of wanting to purchase tickets manager said he did not have any giving the excuse of fedex not coming in( I would not have minded then if they would have told me they didn't have any but it's the dishonesty and rudeness that made me mad). I gave the same courtesy back and left upset. I came back from my sight seeing finding my card key being disactivated luckily we found housekeeping and they opened the room without checking ID. We decided to rest a little in the room and called house keeping for 2 coffee cups missing and if they could bring it up(we waited for half an hour so I called again)..she answered me we a \"Listen, I told you I'm busy and as soon as I have someone they'll be up.\" I really don't want to make this any longer ...so to all just wanted to give this info and hope you make the right decision when making a reservation in this hotel.

The entire floor was really hot and smelled like wet carpet. Once I got to my room, I noticed several things: 1. It was very small and they were still using those antiquated bed spreads (of course this was not an issue in Minneapolis, even Hampton Inn has moved away from this to down -or downlike- comforters). 2. The room was very dark and had gloomy look to it. 3. My bathroom floor had several stains, my soap dish had brown stuff and hair in it, and the tub and sink was cracked in several places. As if this wasn't enough, I noticed that I was stuck with a connecting room (something that Milleniums are known for getting rid of when they take over hotels). After asking for a room change, I was placed in a non connecting room with a few less cracked amenities, but the door lock looked as if someone had taken a crowbar to it several times.
