Having previously lived in Liverpool I knew the location about 0.5mile from the Albert Dock and 0.5 mile from the city centre would be great! It was a perfect location if you are looking for a hotel close to all the attractions and which is easy to get to. When we arrived we were informed by recpetion that the room we had paid for (with 2 double beds in it) was unavailable as they had overbooked their guests into the hotel that weekend. They did not offer me a suggestion as to how they were going to resolve this issue until I said that it was their problem to deal with as I had paid for that room. They offered me a room with a double bed and said they would put a z-bed in it. In that situation they told me they could do no more. When we got to the room the bar manager was stood waiting with the z-bed and he was the one who put it up and made the bed. The bedding which was put on was dirty (it had black marks all over it!) so the bar manager had to go and find more sheets to put on the bed. I must say he was very pleasant and offered my friend and I a complimentary glass of wine each for the inconvenience. On inspection of the room we found there were 2 complimentary bottles of water in the room, one of which had been drunk by the previous occupant and not replaced before our arrival! The bathroom had hair all on the tiles around the bath which was a bit horrid to have to clear up and the blanket on the bed was stained and dirty. We used the pool facilities on our second day and these were clean and tidy, although we were slightly dubious when we heard a complaint that someone was shaving in the sauna! Nice! The morning of check out we had an express check out form slipped under our door stating that if we wanted express check out we just needed to write our credit card details on the form. This would have been fine apart from when I read the bill they had charged us for 2 nights accommodation, which I had already paid for when I booked the room(!) and a bottle of white wine from the minibar which we never even touched(!). In the hotel's defence they were fairly quick to sort out the bill once I told them of the problems. There was a distinct lack of communication though as they were talking about our stay in a room with 2 double beds and I had to tell them about what had happened when we checked in. In conclusion, the hotel itself was very nice and in a very good location however I believe it was just poorly run and the standards were slipping. We paid a lot of money for the hotel and this was not reflected in the standards of the hotel. I would be reluctant to use this hotel again.", "title": "Good location but poorly run", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "aih12345", "date": "August 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 18911378, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Cleanliness/Poor standards"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 1 night after watching the Evita musical in the Empire.
