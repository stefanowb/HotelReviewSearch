One of the rooms was OK and the other was so small that you couldn't really move around in it all and there were no drawers to unpack, only a small closet for hanging. The smaller of the two rooms was room 35 and I would strongly recommend not to accept this room if you have 2 people(another reviewer has also mentioned this). It might be OK for 1. Room 33 was ok but there were splatters on the wall that looked like blood (we were hoping it was just red wine). The air conditioner in one room did not work and the other dripped all night. We told the staff about it and they were looked at but not fixed. Luckily for us the weather turned cool and they were not needed. The bathroom in room 35 is just so small that you cannot shower without the bathroom getting wet. A larger person would have a tough time. Room 33 had a tub with a shower head as well but no shower curtain. The rooms were inexpensive and because we spent so little time in them we managed. I did find myself not wanting to go back to the hotel except to sleep. The staff in the hotel was friendly, polite and helpful to us. I have no complaints about them. The lobby has a computer that can be used for no charge, which was a nice convenience. The location is good and there are several good restaurants close by, as well as a close metro stop. I think that your experience at this hotel depends so much on which room you get. Our was the worst but some of the ones that I could see when they were being cleaned look better. Also, the rooms are not very sound proof and the tiny little elevator sounds like it is groaning when it starts up and this can be heard at night as you lie in bed. My advise is to ask to see the room before you accept it and you may have a better stay then we did.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 9, 2006", "id": 5327610}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "I have been reading the reviews on this site and wanted to add my 2 cents worth. My husband and I stayed here last year and it was literally one of the cheapest hotels with it's own facilities that we could find in one of the nicer parts of Paris as we were travelling on NZ dollars and didn't want to stay in a hostel or near a railway station. Due to the price we were not expecting much and to be honest, feel we got what we paid for. The rooms were basic and quite small so not so great with our huge packs and although we requested a double bed, we got two very small singles pushed together and yes the bathroom was tiny but at least it had a shower (none of these hand helds over the bath I have seen in other european hotels) and everything was very clean. We had lovely blue room with a large window which got the evening sun and had a view out over the street. The elevator was a laugh and after getting our bags up there we tended to use the stairs. A friend of ours was staying at an IBIS near a railway station and we visited her room which was slightly larger, the furnishings not as nice and she was paying more a night in a grotty, loud area than we were in lovely Saint Germain. Overall, Paris is not a cheap place to visit so if you are wanting a clean hotel in a great location and tend to spend most of your time out and making the most of your destination while only using the room only as somewhere to sleep and wash then this is great option. If you are one of those people who tend to spend a lot of time in your room or are travelling for a special occassion then you would be well advised to pay a bit more and get something more approriate.", "title": "Teeny Tiny Hotel but good for those not travelling on pounds or euros", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "JaxM", "date": "May 31, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 5237929}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed here in April 2006 for three nights -- never again.

It looked into the small square opening between buildings (can't call it a courtyard -- it couldn't have been more than 6 feet by 6 feet) and smelled of trash.

My room did look like those in the photos on the website and yes while the bed does take up a lot of the room there were two excellent wardrobes with a personal safe that you activate via any mag strip card of your own eg. a library card or ATM card. The room had a desk and a stand to put your suite case on while you unpacked then I put it into one of the wardrobes. The bathroom do surfice but I can understand while a few people have mentioned problem with the shower recess. It is a generally standard europe shower tray with a curtain across it and although it is wide it is not very deep and can lead you to easily knock the curtain outside of the tray area causing you to wet the floor. Now the staff are all extremely helpful and there was a very delightful lady in particular who was very helpful when looking for particular things to do and see. The only thing that I would like to point out is that getting to the hotel by train can be a little confusing when changing from the RER to the Metro. I interchanged at Saint Michel Notre Dame from the RER and tried to find the platform to get on the Metro 10 line. I had a 20kg suitcase and had to lug it up about 60 stairs as there is no escalator and the walk about another 100-200meters to get onto the the M10 Platform to go to Maubert Mutualite. Now I know I got a little lost doing this... may be I walked further that required - I'm not really sure but it was probably the only issue I has the whole trip. The hotel was able to book an airport car service for 25 Euro for a single person (cheaper if you are a pair)it get me to a very early morning flight and this was great!", "title": "Right Price,.
