The hotel was spotless and my room was in the new tower. The staff was great from my room attendant to the front desk and the restuarant and bar staff. Some painting was going on but in the main lobby and out of everyones way (not an issue). The pool is nice and heated and the outdoor tiki bar was a great place to hang out and meet some of the hotel guests. Beach access and rentals for everything from chairs to boogie boards was great. Had most of my meals there, breakfast was good, burgers and the club sandwitch for lunch were always good. For dinner I would reccomend the Flat iron steak it is great!!!. Wall Mart, Winn Dixie and many other shops and stores are one block away. Melbourne beach is a nice little seaside town seperate from the city itself, really quiet and all the people were very nice and friendly. I would love to go back and spend another week there, had a great time.", "title": "Great place, no complaints", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "treynolds37", "date": "November 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 22013008, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The staff was great", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Staff at check-in was great.
