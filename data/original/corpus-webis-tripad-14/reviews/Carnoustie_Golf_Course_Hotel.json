From the moment we arrived at reception until the moment we left we were given excellent service. Our room, although were did not ask for a \"room with a view\" was great as we overlooked the 1st and 18th and as we are golfers we were delighted. As the weather was not too great on our first day we were able to fill our day with walks and used the leisure facilities. A great way to relax and look out at the cold windy weather which you would expect in November. Food in the restaurant was good but if we are totally honest we would have preferred a wee bit more on our plate...but what we had was very tasty! Outwith the high season there are lots of deals out there and we would advise you to snap them up as we experienced a wee bit luxury at a great price!", "title": "Carnoustie Links Hotel without playing golf is First class", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TOPCATDC", "date": "November 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 85873582}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay in this hotel - and got a very good deal!.
