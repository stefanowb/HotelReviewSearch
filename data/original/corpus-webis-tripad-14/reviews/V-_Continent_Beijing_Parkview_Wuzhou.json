I would consider the rooms overheated but we were able to get the window opened for fresh air. Without doubt dining at \"cafe Asia\" was outstanding and run by an Australian Executive chef catering to all tastes. The cost was very reasonable (148 rmb for dinner buffet) per person and the child free. We ate all our meals in Cafe Asia as it was so diverse, exciting and fresh that you could not do better outside.
