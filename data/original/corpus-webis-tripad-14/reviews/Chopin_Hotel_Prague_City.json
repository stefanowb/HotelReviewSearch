The lady at the reception was very friendly and the check-in went very fast. Her english was good. Our room, located on the fifth floor, was very clean and modern, but rather dark because there was only a little window. We had one bed for 2 persons and this bed was rather small (too small in my opinion). There was a pretty modern flat screen tv and there was also airco which was good because it was very warm in Prague when we stayed there. At night you could hear the elevator, because our room was located next to it. Other than that it was very quiet. The bathroom was very clean. There was no bath, only a shower. The breakfast buffet was ok: there was enough choice: a lot of different sorts of bread (most of them tasted very salty), little croissants, eggs (not every day though), apples, cornflakes, yoghurt, two sorts of orange juice (not fresh though) etc. But to be honest we must say that we have had better breakfast buffets in other 3* hotels of the same price class. The hotel is located close to the raiway station and not that far from the heart of the city centre (I estimate it was a 15 minute-walk to the astronomical clock) and the most important shopping areas (it was not that far from the wenceslaus square where there are a lot of shops).
