Stayed with a friend in a room with two single beds, they were huge though and so comfortable, wish I could have brought themhome with me. The AC in the room worked spotlessly in what turned out to be the hottest days in Berlin in 60 years. Staff were friendly although we did not interact too much with them. Restaurant seemed nice, regret not trying it since we had problems finding good places to eat (good research before going is recommended).

Just back from two nights at the Melia, very comfortable hotel. One of the cleanest hotels that we have encountered worldwide, everywhere was spotless, Our Junior Suite on the 8th floor was superb, You can judge the level of cleanliness by a bathroom & this one was CLEAN, well appointed with all the amenities that you could expect. We overlooked Friedrichstrasse & the river. The Level was a pleasant oasis in the centre of a big city and Berlin is big !. The staff in The Level were exceptional ( Melia, you must be so proud of them, they are all first class ambassadors for the Hotel & Group). We received 60 euros between us by booking through the Melia website which we used on the second evening in the Restaurant, didn't plan it, but the bill came to 59.40 !

You must prebook to enter this fantastic building beforehand for security reasons but you will not be disappointed. The Melia is also close to the river, Museum Island, and many interesting, reasonable restaurants. The staff at the Melia were all helpful and accommodating in every way. We stayed in a lovely room on the \"Level\" floor which gave us free access to the lounge which served breakfast every morning, and a light dinner every evening from 6-10:00. The view from our room was outstanding! They always had drinks,fruit, and internet services available. I had a nasty cold when I arrived in Berlin and the staff in the lounge were always offering me hot tea with honey. I can't say enough about how nice everyone who works there was.

The river cruises leave from the riverbank right next to the hotel - this is a great way to see this lovely city. The Reichstag is amazing - this is about 15 minutes gentle walk from the hotel, but make sure you register to visit beforehand - you can't just turn up there for security reasons. However, it is well worth the effort - the glass dome is fantastic, and it is all free. If you want to splash out there is a restaurant on the top, but you need to prebook there too. The staff at the Melia were all very helpful, the room was clean and very comfortable, and totally silent - you can't even hear toilets flushing!
