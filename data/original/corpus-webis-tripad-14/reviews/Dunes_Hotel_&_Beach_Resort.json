Also myself and another person (not in my party) on the flight back were unwell at around the same time (just before landing), so I am inclined to think this was brought on by the in-flight food.", "title": "Overall would recommend", "helpfulness": 24, "user": "Poppy100", "date": "October 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10025815, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Lots of activities available"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled with family", "text": "As for the Dunes, I would reiterate what other people have said.

We have nothing but positive things to say about Marcos and would recommend him to anyone. He picked us up and dropped us off to get to our trips and was always very prompt. The Canaima/Delta tour was brilliant. We spent a day on the Orinoco staying in a lodge on the river and then went on to the Canaima National Park. Unfortunately we didn't get to see Angel Falls as the weather was too bad but the rest of the trip was so amazing that we weren't really all that disappointed.

For about $55- US you can buy a daily all inclusive meal package allowing you to eat at the resort's many restaurants. The food is adequate, but you really don't have any nearby options except for the small Zaragoza beach cafes to the South West. The kitchens are minimal for those who cook and there are limited groceries at the resort anyway. No need to pay the $40- van to Polimar. Just use a taxi if you have less than 3 people and you will be more flexible and save $$s. For those who just stay on a resort and don't explore the nearby towns, the Dunes would be ok. But we just like to explore on our vacations and ended up renting a car for $70- US a day. I also suggest a taxi ride into nearby Juangriego for lunch or dinner.
