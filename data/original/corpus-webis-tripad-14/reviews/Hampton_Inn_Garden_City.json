When we arrived we were greeted by Melissa at the desk, one of the most pleasant people we have encountered on our travels. We were told we could park in one of two lots. We asked if one was more secure than the other, she said no, but we could have a room overlooking our car. How accommodating! First room did not have functioning air-conditioner, called front desk, courteous Melissa said she would assign another room, and bring the key to us. We went down for the new key, in about 5 minutes she called to see if we were comfortable in the new room. How great is that in today's travel world? The room is clean and well appointed. We like the very large shower with no bath tub to step over to get into.
