We walked to the sony centre in about 10 minutes, and from there all the main attractions in East Berlin are sign posted and can be reached on foot! A five minute walk in the opposite direction finds you surrounded by lovely pavement cafes and bars, great restaurants and quaint little independant shops. There is also a market square at Winterfeldplatz. In the immediate vicinity of the hotel is the B\u00fclowstra\u00dfe u bahn station which takes about 30 seconds to walk to and is 3 stops from zoo station. There are a few bars on the street, one a few doors down from the hotel which has a fairly good jukebox, and plenty of fast food joints which are cheap and cheerful. Around the corner is a newsagent which sells British newspapers if you so require! Although it is next to the rail line we never heard any noise from it, or any of the local businesses. The hotel itself was perfect for us for a few days away. The rooms are an adequate size, with a small seating area with a sofa, arm chair and coffee table and a small tv. There is also a small fridge which doubles as a mini bar, reasonably priced but we used it to store drinks we bought at a near by shop! The bathroom is admittedly small, with no bath, just a shower cubicle, but that suited us fine as we didn't spend much time in it! The breakfast is great, with plenty of fresh fruit, cereals, yoghurt, various types of breads, cheeses and cold meats and salads. For a hot breakfast there were boiled or scrambled eggs, sausages and what looked like lamb koftas. They also had several types of fruit juice, a pot of coffee on every table and several varieties of tea. All in all a great hotel at a great price. We will definitely stay there again.", "title": "Great hotel", "user": "saoirsechick", "date": "April 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 27306755}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "We could find nothing wrong with the hotel room it was clean had everything in it you needed, bathroom was a bit small but served its purpose, the hotel is on a main road plus the train line also runs past the hotel so can be a bit noisy if you have the windows open or if you are a light sleeper take some ear plugs.
