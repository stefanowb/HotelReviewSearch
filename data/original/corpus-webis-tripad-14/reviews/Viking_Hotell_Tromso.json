Everything in the centre is around 5-10 minutes walk away, the Cable Car a little further if you walk over the bridge or you can take a bus. Rooms are small, with not much storage space, but more importantly for me going in Winter, they are very warm with an individually controlled heater in the room. Bathrooms are fab with heated floor tiles and modern shower and fittings. Everything very clean. Breakfast is included and has the usual range of bread, cheese, ham, fish, boiled eggs, muesli, juice etc. Tea and Coffee are free in reception all day - a very nice touch. Now for the best part ... the Staff are outstanding! Incredibly helpful and friendly, nothing is too much trouble and they will make sure you have a wonderful stay. They were a great help to us recommending bus routes, activities etc (as others have mentioned, a bus ride on the island is a very nice way to get a tour of your surroundings). Tromso familie park (about 40 mins by bus) was also fun. Lots of different animals that can be petted and horses that offer rides for children in summer - just check the bus timetables as they are often infrequent at the weekend.", "title": "3 Star Hotel with 5 Star staff, very friendly and cosy", "user": "FayeW", "date": "March 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 58243163}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled solo", "text": "The reception area is a great place to speak with the staff, either to pick their brains for info or just to learn a little more about the area.
