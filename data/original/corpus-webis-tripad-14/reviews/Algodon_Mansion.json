There are shops and wonderful restaurants right around the corner as well. Each time we went out we felt like we were returning to an oasis. The staff was stellar. When we asked for restaurant recommendations, instead of offering up the usual tourist options, they gave us suggestions that would appeal to my daughter and they were excellent. We ate steak in Palermo Hollywood at Miranda a very cool and hip restaurant and the next night went to a very funky yet exceptional italian restaurant.

Quite a disappointment. We found it very inconvenient to use unstaffed as well.
