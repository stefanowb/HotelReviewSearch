There was a nice rapport in the waiting area, and staff were very attentive. The food is very much fine dining. With every course, you will get several versions of what you have ordered. I had the soup for starter, which was nice. It had a dumpling in the middle. Then I had a duck dish consisting of duck cooked four ways. The foie gras was amazing. Then I had the dry aged beef. It was alright. Just like a nice roast beef with gravy. My wife had the pork, and it was in a different league altogether. Desserts and petit fours were lovely. The star of the show here is definitely Neven Maguire. He was so nice to talk to and genuinely friendly, and grateful to see us. The bill was pricey, but you are paying for the quality and the name. A minor gripe was that we were booked for the 9pm sitting, but ended up starting our meal at 10pm, and finishing around midnight. It's very late to be finishing a heavy meal really. On the whole I won't be back, unless I get treated to a special occasion again !

We choose the dinner menu as opposed to Prestige menu. Every course was a culinary delight. Taste and presentation was outstanding. . What we liked in particular were those little surprises that came to us between courses. An atmosphere of congeniality in the dining grew to the point that we had a wonderful with the couple seated next to us. The food was exquisite and the atmosphere was homely.We really liked the explanation that the table attendant gave to point out the culinary delights of each dish.

We stayed out in the courtyard house, which was a beautiful two bedroom house. With loving living area etc. We checked in at the hotel and were then driven to the house. We told them a time to collect us at and they collected us and brought us to the restaurant. Imelda Nevan's wife greeted everyone and was lovely. We had the taster menu with wine selection, The food was divine, the wine was great and the service was great. Glass of champagne to start and then various white and red wines. The staff explained each food and wine course. Everything was perfect. We will definitely return and tried to book it again for this year in June but it is fully booked for accomodation. When we return the four of us agreed that we will not go for the wine selection as it was quite a bit of wine, we would just order our wine separately. After our meal we were brought back to the lounge area. Nevan himself was walking around and I stopped him and explained it was my mothers birthday and he came over and met her and we all had our photos taken and he give her a DVD. So he was really nice. We also had the option of getting our breakfast served in the house or having a bigger range of breakfast in the restaurant, He recommended that we get the breakfast in the restaurant as its a good experience. He was right. The breakfast was fantastic. A real treat. Overall for 4 meals including the wine courses and the accomodation we paid around \u20ac700. So it was costly enough for one night, but a lovely treat and well worth it. Would definitely recommend it and will return.", "title": "Excellent food, excellent accomodation, will definitely return.
