We arrived at 12:30 a.m. -- and stayed only after the gentleman at the registration desk assured us we could have a late check-out. The room -- it was called a \"suite\" but was more a large room with 2 television sets -- was nicely decorated but a bit cramped -- though it had two spectacularly large bathrooms (without tubs, only showers, very PC). The lighting was inadequate and made use of the ugly new fluorescent bulbs, and though it was well below freezing, we were tempted to leave the heat off because the room is heated only through a very noisy space heater mounted on the wall and belching dusty air across the room. And needless to say, the hotel absolutely refused to honor the late check out promise -- even to the extent of another 15 minutes. The food was mediocre and the service surly.

Do nothing or #2 open the door and be told to go F myself. That would have resulted in the Police coming to restore order. If you ever wondered how a wedding party could end up in jail, we experience the how and why. They were too loud and NASCARish.
