The hotel is in a superb location overlooking the harbour which has a fascinating variety of sea-going vessels. An architectural gem, the rooms in the Skagen Brygge are spacious and fairly well appointed and the staff could not be more friendly or helpful. The lobby bar can get fairly busy but service from the well trained staff is swift, polite and efficient. Breakfast is as light or as substantial as you want it to be and there is plenty of variety in the fare on offer.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "luceo", "date": "August 25, 2005", "id": 3806569}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2005", "text": "If there is a downside to the hotel it is that at the weekend the harbour area is very busy and the street noise goes on quite late in summer - it leaves one little choice but to join the party!", "title": "Loved the view from this hotel", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "joelmari", "date": "July 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3664323}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice hotel, shame about the noise", "text": "We stayed here for two nights in mid June and delighted in the fabulous views from our windows of a working harbor. The staff was terrific and went out of their way to help us navigate the city. The rooms are not large by US standards, but are very well kept and attractive. The hotel is near the ferry depot, so it was easy for us to take the catamaran to Bergen, a pleasant four hour trip up the Coast. Parking is expensive, and the city is very accessible, so I would suggest dropping your car off before checking in here.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "JCW", "date": "August 19, 2004", "id": 2461818}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Made my stay a pleasure", "text": "Superb location and gorgeously photogenic from the outside. Pleasant room, and the hotel has some nice design features (such as a nice small coffee lounge on the fourth floor, open to all guests). Decent breakfast.

I have stayed in many hotels while travelling but few with such friendly and helpful staff as this. I had to stay for many weeks between June and October this year and my long stay away from home was made more comfortable by the way in which everything in the hotel was dealt with. The connection to the local restaurants is an added bonus making eating out easy and enjoyable.
