We liked the first unit as well and then checked on the second one and said this is it. All tile throughout the unit. The bedrooms had carpet. The master shower was huge with two shower heads and the second bathroom was in the hallway. The unit was clean and had an excellent view of the Gulf. With our stay we had two complimentary chairs and umbrella with the reservation which were just great for relaxation! The Kitchen had all accessories you might need and had a full fridge. There is a big dining room and the unit itself had a fantastic layout. I would highly recommend this unit for a family of four, although you can hit the pull out sleeper for 6 if need be. Would stay here again if I am in the area.

This is our fourth time staying here and let me say you will never be able to find a more georgeous view and beach area. The beaches are more quiet than Destin. Our son and his fiance, who were out of college for spring break, stayed here with us for the first time and they loved it. We were a little worried that the water would be too cool to enjoy, but it was warm enough to have fun in and the pools are heated. Our condo, which was C208 was beautifully decorated with comfortable king size pillow top bedding. It was stocked with any cooking utensils you could possibly need. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The beach attendant where chairs are provided each day knew our names and made us feel like family each day.

It was so wonderful to look out of our master bedroom and living room and see such beautifulness every morning, evening, and all throughout the day! The view was absolutely gorgeous I can't say it enough! The first day of our stay was cloudy but our view of the ocean was still incredible. We saw dolphins in the ocean everyday, (bring a pair of binoculars). I enjoyed staying in Fort Walton instead of Destin because I don't like crowds. Although our condos were in a line of other condos on the beach, where we stayed did not seem to crowded with people. They say in the summer it does get a lot busier. We stayed in a spacious 3br/3b. All kitchen utensils and cook ware was provited and it was not old junky stuff. All you need to do is bring food, saran wrap etc. They have 4 propane grills and I think 4 charcoal, we used the propane. It's first come first serve. I think they even keep up with cleaning the grills b/c we were surprised it was so clean. We also received a free beach umbrella and 2 chairs everyday of our stay (if you need to rent more there is a charge). And we were given an adult pass to a dolphin cruise in Destin on the Southern Star. It was family friendly, we so enjoyed it and got to see several dolphins in the bay and out in the ocean. (ask about the complimentary adult pass to this one). The ticket for adults is 27. We enjoyed it. If you go on the dolphin cruise make sure you get there 30-45 min early because it gets crowded trying to get on the boat at last minute. For our last minute shopping we shopped at Publix grocery store about a mile away. I think next time we go I will do all my shopping there. It's a little more than wal-mart but it's so easy being right there and it has several different selections of all kinds of foods. I was impressed and I will shop there next time instead of toting food all the way from Tx! lol. There is also free movie rental at the condos. We stayed on the 5th floor. There is a pier two miles down the beach you can walk to or drive to. It cost 2. to walk out onto or you can pay 7.50 to fish. We didn't have fishing equipment, not sure but you probally could rent it. The peir is called Anglers. There is also a restaurant and bar at the Anglers and the beach surrounding looked congested so I would smile when I thought about heading back to my 'low key\" condos at The Breakers. During spring break I would definatly recommend the Breakers at Fort Walton Beach because all the partiers are just not there.

Free DVD rentals included and came in handy once the sun went down. Just a couple of disappointments that we we had, but they didn't really detract from the great time we had. First, they don't provide you beach towels. Wish I had known this going in. Second, they provide you with laundry, dish and hand soap, but they don't have shampoo and conditioner which we thought was odd.
