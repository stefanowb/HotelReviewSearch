Difficulties encountered included brusque receptionist who added $30/night to our internet rate for an uncomfortable cot which was already in the room; musty smell throughout the hotel; poorly maintained recreation room - billiards tables had ripped felt, cues were warped, bridge was broken...;no air-conditioning in the rooms; broken window counterweights - sticks were used to prop open windows; walls between guest rooms are paper thin - every activity of your neighbors could be distincly heard. The biggest complaint was with the whale-watch reservation desk which apparently has a contract with a mediocre company that provided poor naration. This desk allowed us to book a cruise for a foggy morning - we should have been advised to wait until the afternoon when visibility was much better- after all, its a whale-WATCHING experience.

The guide book implied that itis just about the only place to stay in Tadoussac, but in fact there are quite a few other options worth checking out before you book. The location is unquestionably great, with a view across the hotel lawn onto the bay. My first advice would be to avoid paying the extra for an ocean view room. The window on our room was so small that unless you walked right up to it you had no idea what the view was, so unless you intend to pull up a chair and sit in your room right next to the window, the \"ocean view\" won't do anything for you. The room was clean and well equipped, but small. It was probably the smallest room we stayed in during three months of travel in Canada. The breakfast and dinner buffets are expensive, but can't be faulted in terms of quantity, and the quality was certainly adequate. Staff at both desk and restaurant were good. The public areas are rather dated, and as the hotel had lots of groups coming and going, they were also noisy and manic. The whole of Tadoussac is set up for whale watching and cruises, so you can book anywhere and the shuttle buses run everywhere, so staying at the Hotel Tadoussac doesn't give you any particular advantage there.There is car parking and internet, although both the internet and TV were fairly poor quality. The hotel does have other dining options, but we didn't try them. So, overall nothing was a big problem, but it was one of the very few places on our Canada trip where I felt slightly ripped off when I checked out.", "title": "Great location, but expensive and showing its age", "user": "golsonic", "date": "July 18, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71332624}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "While on an extended stay in Montreal, my husband & I decided to take an overnight side trip driving up the St. Lawrence River to see the sights.
