The Holland is preparing to open a restaurant on the premises and we are eager to try it out on our next visit.

Having grown up in Alpine, I have seen some of the changes over the years and this time, the Holland Hotel welcomes you with it's original beauty and feel. What a treat! Save the stays at the newer hotels in town for when you have no other choice. Choose the Holland when in Alpine, you will not be sorry. You will have more to share when you get home and talk about your trip. History galore at every turn. You will not be giving up anything in the way of comforts and services. The staff was totally service oriented, professional but miles away from stuffiness! Cool little bar tucked into the lobby so plenty of room to spread out and check it all out!
