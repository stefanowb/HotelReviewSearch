When I originally booked the dates I was a little aprehensive as I was going on the good word of other people on this site, but after talking directly to the management at the hotel I was convinced. When we arrived our check in was handled politely and quickly so we could settle in and start enjoying San Juan. The breakfast was satisfactory and simple, but the staff kept things neat and tidy and always politely answered any questions. The rooms were clean and bug free (not an easy task I imagine in a tropical country). If I could make one suggestion to the hotel it would be to update the rooms as they have the lobby. The hotel's site says that it is across the street from the beach, but it is practically ON THE BEACH!!! The sound of the wind and the waves was loud but lulled us to sleep every night (which wasn't hard after days of discovering San Juan and Old San Juan). If you get a chance check out the pizza/deli just up the street from Walgreens on Dr Ashford Ave across from a clothing store and beside a Mexican place - it is the BEST we have ever had!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "quincey1", "date": "April 8, 2007", "id": 7292099}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "San Juan for the weekend", "text": "Paula - Canada", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "SJQ", "date": "March 3, 2007", "id": 6907992}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Motel 6 with older hotel charm", "text": "Needed to find a not so pricey room for the weekend of Feb 24th to attend my sons college (medical school) HOORAY!! graduation held in Bayamon which is 10 miles fron San Juan.
