Fine. When we did check-in, we immediately went to the elevators to go to the 8th floor, where our room would be. However, turns out that the family we were sharing the elevator with were also given keys to the exact same room! They got there first as we let them out the elevator first. Back to check-in, for a half hour wait while they deal with others who are checking in for the first time. Then they apologize and give us keys to a room on the 6th floor. We go to the room. Wouldn't you know it - there was someone else already in that room also! (And, btw, our keycards did in fact open these other peoples' rooms.) Back downstairs again, to complain, and told the manager is \"too busy\" to speak with us. Finally get a third room, where there's only two towels/robes etc., even though we are a party of three adults. We also needed linens for the second bed. Then there was the broken shower and non-working tv (both of which got fixed pretty quickly, to at least give credit where it's due). When the manager finally spoke with us, he apologized and said we could have a free breakfast the next day. Really? That makes it ALL better. Wow. Not a cheap hotel, but kinda feels like it.

We had a very long stay (3 months) and we were never disappointed. Starting off with Felix and Antonio at the front door with smiles and greetings - always. Knew our names and used them. Front desk was so friendly and also knew our names. We had a very clean suite on the 11th floor facing the lagoon and pool area. It was great to have a small kitchen area and separate bedroom. We were told they are changing out the mattresses and that is a good thing - ours was definitely old. Thoroughly enjoyed the terrace - lots to look at and could enjoy the sunsets. We live full time at a beach, so beach view was not important to us. Concierge area with Michael, Cristina, Alain, Estaban and lots others was relaxing and enjoyable. This area has inside and outside seating. Every time we went in we were greeted like friends. It would be nice to vary the breakfast offerings, but it was still very good. Evening meals were tasty. This area closes for Sat and Sun which means you cannot access the sitting areas - would be great if members could still access the sitting areas during the weekend. We ate several times at Voga always sitting at the bar. Once again, greeted by name. Food was excellent and Balushka(I apoligize if spelled incorrectly) was delightful. The hotel has 3 pool areas. We went to the adult only pool - infinity looking over the beach. Doesn't get much better than that. Nice fitness area with beach views. Laundry facilities on 4th floor. We like the location of hotel. It is close to very good, local restaurants and a park that has local events(music and food) on some weekends. The beach has plenty of chairs and umbrellas, but beware the surf is very rough and I would not recommend it for small children. There is a casino and covered parking. Lobby bar can be very festive and fun. Cost of drinks is very high. One martini - $17.50 and margaritas at the pool were $14.00 each....", "title": "They Do it Right", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "2TravlinFools", "date": "October 11, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 180579082}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were sad to leave.

It was a last minute change from the Marriott by the convention center where I usually stay when in PR to here and im soooo glad that I did. My flight didnt get me there until 1am and when the taxi pulled up ($20fromtheairport) the outside greeters made me feel so warm and happy to be there. Pedro a Bald friendly employee was the 1st peron my Fianc'e and I met that made us feel at home. If he wasnt giving you a high five or making a joke they all was rushing to grab your bags and physically help me out of the cab. The greatest thing about them was that they DIDNOT beg or ask for a tip. This made me scramble through my purse to make sure that I could give them as much money as I could find. They then sent me inside to check in with a young man name Miguel who we found to be so smiley and warm. After giving us a Cabana room by the pool he did not just give us the key, he came from around the counter to direct us in the direction of our room. This was something that I saw all of the check in people do. It made us feel like our stay there was personal and not just a dollar that they were getting. When we got to our room I was so excited and happy on how beautiful it was. From the comfy robe to the to die for soft bed, I was happy. I loved the fact that even at 4am in the morning while we laid on the beach or one of the 3pools that they have I constintly saw security walking back and forth securing the resort. This made me feel very safe. I was even comfortable enough to doze off by the hot tub. The location of the hotel is perfect. If you do not want to eat there they have a 24hr resturant across the street that makes the BEST Empanadas for $2.50 each and serves $1 Heineken Beers all night long. You can also get Subways and Wendys if you not down for local food. There is also a Gucci and LV store down the block from the hotel. I also took a bus from infront of the hotel for .75cents down to Old San Juan to sight see. I was so happy with my stay I had to let the Manager Miguel know how happy I was to be there and speaking with him I can see how humble he was and appreciative he was for my compliment I could tell why his staff was so great. I must say that the ONLY problem that I had was that the Rum and Coke and Sangria that my Fianc'e and I had served to us while laying on the beach was weak.
