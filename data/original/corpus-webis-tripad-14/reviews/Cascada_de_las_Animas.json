What a great stay. We originally looked for something close to Santiago for a long weekend. We originally were looking to spend some time at one of the thermal baths. So I looked at Termas de Colinas, but found out they were more than an hour away. We opted for the stay anyway. Originally, we booked to stay in the Hostel but we were pleasantly surprised that a cabin became available when we arrived. The cost was about 20,000 CLP more per night but we decided it would be a well spent 40 USD\u2026 We arrived around noonish and were greeted with open arms and welcome smiles. I was a bit surprised because on the phone, the young lady seemed a bit tired and pre-occupied with other things. Pleasantly we were greeted with cold water to drink and a smile. Upon checking in and paying for our cabin we were shown where our cabin was located and asked if we wanted help getting there. I should mention that when you make the reservation, a 50% deposit is required of which only portions are refundable depending on the time frame involved. It will be wise to read the T&Cs required for any changes or cancellations. Once we got to the cabin, a lady greeted us with the key and showed us in. She made sure we had clean towels and asked if anything else was needed. It was very kind of her to ask as (from reading other reviews) I was concerned about the hot water. I asked her and within 10 minutes a man was there to light the hot water heater. We had steaming hot water all weekend! After settling in and deciding we for sure would not make the Hot Springs, we took a short walk around the place. It was beautiful. The outside of the cabin was separated by trees and bushes etc. so you had the feel of seclusion. The Walnut trees were huge and beautiful and offered plenty of shade for the area. The grape arbor next to the house was teaming with some of the sweetest grapes I have ever tasted. We walked down to the \u201cInformation Cabin\u201d and asked around about what to do. We decided on an all day horseback trek up the mountain with lunch provided. It was a little spendy but well worth it just for the views! We also opted for a massage and reflexology after the horseback ride AND (like dummies) we signed up for a river raft ride the following morning. We then retired to the restaurant for a light appetizer of Shrimp and Mushroom Pil Pil. Pil Pil is basically saut\u00e9 in butter and garlic with a few other \u201csecret\u201d herbs and spices. This was some of the best we have had in Chile. Done to perfection, the shrimp were very tasteful and just the right size; not the little tiny eraser shrimp not were they the giants\u2026just right. Additionally, the whole rafting and horseback team came over to the restaurant and made a large fire in the fir pit. We sat there talking and telling lies to each other for some time before my wife reminded me that they were in the mid twenties and didn\u2019t need a bunch of people in their mid fifties hanging around! Their hospitality was gracious and we could\u2019ve stayed all night with them, but the truth is, we were tired and had a big day coming!", "title": "Fun for everyone in the group!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "BillyAbroad", "date": "March 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154373430}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Well, the horseback ride up the mountain was a little more intense than what I had anticipated as the trail was sometimes very narrow. But, my wife and I felt completely safe in the hands of our guide CRECHO. He was great! The horses were very gentle and easy to ride. The climb to the top was full of spectacular views of the Maipo River Valley, \u201cCajon de Maipo\u201d, and the ride was enjoyable. Atop the mountain we took a quick (very quick I might add) in a spring fed stream of water that had a section of pool. I thought it was fed by a glacier! Then we had a fine meal of grilled steak, rice and some of the best Chilean Pebre I have tasted. Of course there was plenty of delicious tomatoes and avocado salad as well. Lunch was topped off with a desert of \u201cbanana peaches\u201d that Crecho brought along. After dinner we took a short nap in the Hammocks that near the lunch area and took in the beautiful view. The trip down was a little long, but beautiful scenery made it pass. Yes, we were sore! We couldn\u2019t wait for the massage! We had a short hour or so before our massage so we showered off and walked to the pool area where the massage \u201chooch\u201d was. It was very relaxing and SOLDAR (pronounced sole dar I think) gave the best massage I have ever had! Now I am not an expert on massages but I couldn\u2019t imagine it being any better. It hurt, but in a good way after a full day of horseback riding! After the massage the we opted to go to the restaurant and order rather than cook and we split the grilled Salmon. It was to die for.

While she was in school during the week, we decided to leave town for a little getaway. I did research on Tripadvisor and liked what I read about Cascada de las Animas. This place is beyond wonderful. As others have said, the luxury suites at the lodge are like living in a fairytale. Much of the property is made with geodesic dome structures but the suites are shaped like mushrooms with whimsical wings on the windows. Some of the suites have a skylight to look at the stars at night. The number of stars and the galaxies that can be seen with the naked eye are amazing. There are cabins and camping accommodations as well as horseback riding, swimming, kayaking, zip lining, canopy zip lining, hiking, rafting and tours of the wineries in the area. We had a van pick us up at our hotel in Santiago and return us to the same location for $70.000 Chilean dollars which is about $140 for both of us. It was worth not having any hassles and the van was very comfortable. The best part though, was meeting the staff that run the lodge. We were greeted by a beautiful young lady named Maria Salvador. She showed us to our room and gave us towels for the private pool, just for lodge guests (beautiful, but not heated by the way). My husband and I hiked to the Cascades. It was a nice easy trail but pretty views. The next morning, we had breakfast at the lodge. They had a fantastic spread but also a chef that offered to make us anything we wanted to eat. My husband had french toast and I had eggs. The food was outstanding. At that time, we met David, the brother of Maria. He was extremely professional and runs the lodge like a 5 star hotel. He was a wealth of knowledge about Chile, the area and just a wonderful guy. By the way, he speaks English. By the end of the stay, we felt like we were family, and we were only there for 3 days. We have traveled throughout the world, and this place is now number one on our list. It is a wonderful get away that is only about 1 hour and 20 minutes from Santiago.
