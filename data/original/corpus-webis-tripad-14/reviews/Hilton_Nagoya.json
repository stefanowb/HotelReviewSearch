We had a room on the 22nd floor which was renovated. The room was quite big, well equipped and we received 2 free bottles of water per day + free cookies. The beds were a bit too small but comfortable. The negative aspec of this hotel was the food. We had taken a bed/breakfast/dinner rate but what they don\u2019t mention on the website when booking this rate is that you can only go to the Japanese or to the Chinese restaurants, not the French one nor the Brasserie. We tried the Chinese one and other bad surprise, you can not choose your menu. It was a set menu of 7 or 8 dishes from the starter to the dessert, too spicy for us, and the beverage is not included. (the less expensive bottle of wine is a Ros\u00e9 d\u2019Anjou at 5800 Yen, and it was not so good). They don\u2019t speak English very well and they are running between the tables which was disturbing. We checked the Japanese restaurant for the next day, but it was also a set menu so in the end we decided to pay the dinner at the Brasserie. There is a daily dinner buffet and you can also have a \u201call you can drink\u201d buffet for wine (but they put only 3 bottles of white, 3 of red and only 1 of each is open so you need to ask them to open a new bottle quite often). The food was not exceptional, only the desserts were OK. The breakfast is also average: the bread is so hard that you could break a window with it, the choice is not large for European. I tried their omelette, not really good, same for the cheese and they pretend to offer fresh juices but the orange one was definitively not a real fresh one. When coming in, they ask if you want tea of coffee but we had each time to ask again because nothing was coming \u2026 This is really not the best Hilton we\u2019ve been to for the food aspect, and their English is really bad.", "title": "A great Oasis amidst the summery Nagoya outside", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dunkinky", "date": "August 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 19561537, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The services of Hilton Staff & central location", "disliked": "\u2014 The little miscommunication re late Check Out time"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed at Hilton Nagoya for 2 nights from 14-16 Aug 2008 for holiday.", "title": "Great Hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "cricketa", "date": "March 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14672825, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 convenience and cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 night front desk employee can hardly speak english"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Overall it was a great hotel as expected from a 5 star rating in Japan.
