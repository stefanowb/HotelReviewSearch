Rooms are small, unless you get an upgrade with two bathrooms. Buffet breakfast on first floor is great, but you would be hard pressed to find something simple within walking distance from the hotel because it's located in commerical area. If you take subway, it's very near, however (but like any city it can be less safe especially later at night, yes, really!).

I had excess luggage that Emirates wanted to charge 1000 RMB per 5 kg overage. I shipped 15kg with the hotel for $580. I didn't like to 20% service charge that they applied to everything in the hotel and especially disliked the food from room service (spicy chicken dish). The bed was very comfortable compared to other hotels I've stayed at in Beijing. I guess Starwood properties know how to get it right. The hotel shows its age and one of the first hotels I've stayed at with a tube tv instead of flat screen. I didn't go out, but did notice 2 subway stations near the hotel. At 4AM I decided to make my way to the service counter and ask for some water and then they sent it to my room for free. Beijing hotels usually charge extra for this. The buffet breakfast was decent, but very overpriced $25-35. They have a pool with a nice fitness center. The only downside is charging for internet service which seems to be standard with Starwood properties $12 for 24 hours.
