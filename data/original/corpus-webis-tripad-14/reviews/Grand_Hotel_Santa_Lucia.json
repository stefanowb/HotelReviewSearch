Very professional at reception, and any extra information that we needed (eg, how to get ferry to Positano next day) was provided with a smile. We had booked a \"Delux Sea-View\" room from the hotel's own website, at \u20ac190 per night incl. breakfast. The room (509) was much bigger than we expected, and had the promised sea view - in fact it couldn't possibly have been a better sea view. The room itself was directly opposite the lifts on 5th floor, which concerned me at first in case there were noise issues, but we heard absolutely nothing. On entering the room, you are first in a kind of lobby area with 2 double wardrobes with full-length mirror fronts (handy for the ladies!), there is a door from this area into the bathroom - marble, has everything you'd want - and then there is a large opening into the bedroom area, which has a couch and armchair, a table and 2 chairs, a large telly, full mini-bar, tea & coffee facilities, lovely big bed, and 2 floor-to-", "title": "I LOVED this hotel!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TinyLittleFeet", "date": "July 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17883026}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "ceiling doors, each to a small balcony - and the view!

Anyway, the room is huge (for something that isn't even a suite), has fully-effective air conditioning and electrically-operated (from the bedside switches - that took us a while to find!) black-out shutters etc. We had a quick drink in the beautiful marble bar area before bed - massive measures! Breakfast in the morning was in the beautiful main restaurant - buffet style with hot and cold dishes - different to what Irish and English people are used to, but it'd be no fun if the food was the same all over the world! If you have a sweet tooth, you'll be delighted with the selection of cakes at breakfast! Again, the service was exemplary. We really couldn't complain about a thing. They ordered a taxi from the street for us to get to the port, about 5 minutes drive away. I would so recommend this hotel.

The staff could not have been more helpful, pleasant and accommodating. The hotel is within an easy walk of three terrific and highly rated restaurants (we had fine meals at Bersagliara, Antonio y Antonio, and Mussels and Soul) and at least ten more scattered all across and around the waterfront, right at your doorstep. We'd read some reports of street noise creating problems for sleepers, and although this might be a bit more of a problem in high season during the summer, we never had an issue with it, and slept with the balcony doors open each night. Our room rate included the buffet breakfast at the hotel -- quite a variety, beautifully served, and the milk which accompanies the coffee is hot and frothed. We did a fair share of traveling during our visit -- to Pompeii, out to Sorrento, the Amalfi coast and Paestum -- but for shorter trips and the airport, the taxi stand is located right next to the hotel.

The hotel overview says there is swimming nearby - we could not find any! Not unless you wish to swim in the marina and surroundings with all the rubbish floating in the water. Absolutely disgusting.
