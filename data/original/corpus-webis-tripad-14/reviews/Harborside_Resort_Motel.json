I am also very particular about where I stay - cleanliness is my number one factor. And I almost never stay at motels - I prefer the chain hotels, but this is not an option in Montauk. After searching the net and finding numerous Montauk motels, which either had minimum stays, prices over $200 or poor reviews, I decided to give the Harborside a call, given all the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Luckily they had 2 rooms available - I chose the 2nd floor which is normally my preference. For $165, it seemed like a good price, so I was wondering if there was a catch. I checked out the photos on the motel's website and it seemed fine though.", "title": "Lucky to find the Harborside", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "ejm1385", "date": "August 2, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5539680, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 Could not walk to beach"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "What a find - great place", "text": "Driving toward the hotel, I was nervous about what it would look like, but upon getting to the Harborside, I breathed a sigh of relief.

A genuine and unpretentious atmosphere; simple and well kept.

The hotel was very clean and pleasantly decorated (the rooms were unusually large). The pool was very clean and warm with a lot of seating. But best of all was the owner, Merle, and her staff. She couldn't be nicer and all of her suggestions for restaurants, delis and beaches were terrific. I suggest that the person who reviewed this hotel poorly call around to the other hotels. They will find few vacancies in mid summer and triple the prices. This was a great hotel in a nice quiet area --walking distance to the docks and minutes away from everything else!
