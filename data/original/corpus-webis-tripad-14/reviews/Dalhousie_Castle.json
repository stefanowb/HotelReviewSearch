You cannot help but love the Dalhousie Castle and go with the thought that king and queens have stayed their. The idea of spirits roaming the corridors and rooms adds to the experience. Set in beautiful grounds will only add to it. If there is a negative it has to be down to human intervention and I only say this having paid \u00a3295.00 for photography to be rushed on the day and then feeling disappointed with the overall finish. Again another nice touch would have been for the staff who coordinate weddings to have greeted us on the wedding morning to let us know the protocols for the day but not to worry there are worse things in life.", "title": "Dalhousie photography", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "fenners40", "date": "November 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 185958631}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We booked an overnight stay at the castle lodge through Laterooms.
