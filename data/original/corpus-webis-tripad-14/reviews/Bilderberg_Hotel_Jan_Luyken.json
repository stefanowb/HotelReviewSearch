I have to say that the hotel was out of this world, great for getting away from our stressful careers. We stayed on the top floor and had a good view. The room was compact but really well furnished. The bathroom and room was spotlessly clean and nice and warm. We couldn't have asked for more and was far better than expected. On arriving we ordered a bottle of wine to the room which didn't arrive after half an hour. On calling room service again they couldn't apologise enough and it was in the room within a few minutes followed by even more apologies. The staff were very well presented and very polite.

The food was great and couldn't find any fault at all. It was also on time by the way ! I have to say that probably the best part of our stay was when we had been out for the day, frozen to the bone and tired. We decided to hire the leisure facilities for about an hour and half which consisted of a jaccuzzi, steam room / power body jet shower, sun bed and massage chair (which was quite funny !!), oh and a mini bar. The receptionist will give you a guided tour and show you how everything works for the first time. We also got a discount with a voucher that was in the room but cost around 30 euros for an hour and half. When we had finished in the room we came out really relaxed and red in the face, probably a combination of the steam room, jaccuzzi and the bottle of wine that we finished off between us. (They didn't charge us for it either).
