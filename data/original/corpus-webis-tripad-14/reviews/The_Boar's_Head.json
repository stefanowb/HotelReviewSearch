Yes, there are more modern hotels and yes there are cheaper hotels but having travelled the world extensively and stayed in some top class hotels on business and holiday I doubt if you will find many that combine this quality and character.

They are fantastic! I enjoyed what I had on the lunch buffet so much, that I came back to see what was on the evening dessert menu (unfortuntately I had to eat in the Bistro since my very expensive, linen coolots were deemed inapropriate dinner wear... although someone went in right before me in a tattered jean skirt). I had the Strawberry Experience and my husband had the Chocolate Explosion. All I can say is WOW! I had my doubts about strawberry basil frozen soufle, but that pastry chef knows what he or she is doing.
