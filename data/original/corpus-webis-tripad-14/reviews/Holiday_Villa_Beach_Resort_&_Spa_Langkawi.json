Although the hotel's a little old, the room/bathroom were clean and everything were in order, not forgetting the hotel staff were very friendly and responsive at our requests too. We loved the huge pool and the ample capacity of the hotel here, and the fact that there's a good mix of tourists. The beach is connected from the pool area, and the beach is clean as well. There are water sports available nearby, eg; parasailing. Breakfast provided at the hotel is okay, but we did not try any lunch /dinner. Instead we found SUNDAY Bistro & Restaurant which is located some 200m away , to serve extremely good food and drinks at very reasonable prices. We loved the ambience and the wonderful service rendered by the staff there. They have such bright smiles and welcoming air as you walk in the mini-manor-turned-restaurant. Another must-try is The Loaf, a bakery cafe located at Pantai Kok Harbour Front. Give their Iced Latte a try, it's worth the visual satisfaction. While HV is located at Pantai Tengah, do try to check out the beach stretch located further up called Pantai Cenang, Langkawi main beach.

The room was clean and tidy with a great view of the pool and beach with fabulous air-conditioning. A good sized bathroom with the room cleaned daily. The pool is just amazing. We spent hours swimming, meeting other guests from various countries, playing water volleyball, sunbaking and having a snack from the pool bar. The location of the resort is excellent. There is a convenience store just across the road and a collection of restaurants but worth working a few kilometres up the road to a larger variety of restaurants and bars. The Orchid Restaurant has the biggest prawns we've ever seen which is located a few shops away from our favourite little pizza haunt \"Artisans\", best pizza we've ever had. The Holiday Villa offers an amazing buffet breakfast, the choice is endless. I will definately return to this magic island and fabulous hotel.

We stayed at HV with a group of friends; then just the two of us moved on to Casa Del Mar. As a couple we usually stay in 4 - 4.5 star accommodation, so we were pleasantly surprised with HV. For what we paid we considered it was pretty good. The breakfast was very good with freshly cooked eggs and waffles. Drinks were cheap at the bars. The pool and beach areas were excellent and the aspect from the beach was beautiful; with an archipelago of islands nearby. There were plenty of sunbeds and good opportunity to place them in either shade or direct sun. Our room had a couple of minor problems initially (fridge not working; safe locked) but these were quickly fixed. The room and bathroom were clean - although there was a peculiar smell in the fridge (just what did our predecessors leave in there?). We found the service to be pretty good; at reception; responding to our minor problems; and for room service (eg buckets of ice). We had a balcony looking down on the garden area in front of the pool and this was a good aspect. The bedding was comfortable but poor for couples - 2 single kings, each with separate bedding, pushed together. Inside the room (and others we visited) there's a type of day bed / divan and we thought this was quite useless, having a metal frame and inadequate cushioning. We were lucky that the weather was great for our 8 day stay; as I think the room would have not been very comfortable if bad weather had kept us indoors more. The location is great - apart from the beautiful beach environment, there are convenience stores and some really good restaurants in close walking distance. There was a group of 14 of us and on a couple of occasions we were able to eat and drink to our content for $30-40 AUD per couple. We also ate at more expensive places which had great food but were closer to Australian restaurant prices. A few friends used the spa and thought it was great. There's always plenty of taxis outside and taxi rides to anywhere are cheap. There's not much shopping of note nearby but it's easy to get to Kuah by taxi and some good shopping there (Lagkawi Fair was very good). Holiday Villa guests represented a wide variety of races; which made the experince more interesting. If you're on a tightish budget, then HV is very good - it was a higher standard than we expected beforehand. The two of us continued our holiday alone, in a suite at Casa Del Mar. CDM certainly lives up to its No.1 rating - but then, we also paid a lot more money than HV. Our attitude was that because we saved so much on accommodation at HV, then we could afford to treat ourselves to a suite at CDM. If we hadn't gone to HV specifically with a group of friends, then just the two of us would have probably been in just a room (rather than suite) at CDM or a garden view room at Pelangi. Both of those options would have cost a lot more than HV and I'm not sure that there would have been a great difference in end value. So, while still a believer in \"what you pay is what you get\" I do consider that HV proved to be excellent value for the money.", "title": "Great location", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "whizforty", "date": "August 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8462380}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We were a little apprehensive about the hotel after reading some of the reviews, however it wasn't that bad.

I booked the Superior room which is the cheapest room possible, facing a garden view and on the ground floor. The workmanship is on the flooring is not good but what do you expect from a hotel which has been built for quite sometime! The pool is excellent because it is huge, the shape is nice( unlike the rectangular olympic pool), it has a jacuzzi, child pool, plenty of beach bench, pool bar, great beach and place for beach volleyball. Other amenities include 3 well maintain tennis court and 2 ping pong tables. The bed is not so soft, aircon is cold and room comes with safebox and hair dryer. My room is not carpeted and I am not sure about other more expensive rooms. So, bring along your bedroom slippers for cleanliness and also to avoid stepping on cold floor. Bathroom is huge with a bathtub. All rooms comes with a balcony with 2 chairs.
