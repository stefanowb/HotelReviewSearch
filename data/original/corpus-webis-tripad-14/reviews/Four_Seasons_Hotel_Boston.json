Shortly after I settled in my room, an answer to a knock on the door brought the added generosity of a fruit and cheese snack, courtesy of the front desk. Let me just say, the Four Seasons gained a raving fan for life! They could have just checked me in at a last minute rack rate and moved on, but instead they kept me financially whole, upgraded my room, and went above and beyond to take care of me. In reflection, I experienced the difference in what a customer experiences when responsible employees are permitted and empowered to make decisions.

I surprised her with a night at the Four Seasons, overlooking the Gardens in which I popped the big question. I was expecting a special night of luxury for us - what the hotel and its staff delivered was so much more. Of course every corner of the hotel was stunning: the grand and gorgeous lobby; the perfectly appointed room; the whole place was just an incredible treat for us - two young, modest 20-somethings who don't typically have the money for such luxury. But while I was a little intimidated by the sheer supreme class of it all, the staff made me feel immediately at ease the second I checked in. It didn't seem to matter that we were young, potentially a little under-dressed, or a gay couple. EVERYONE (down to the car attendants out front and the voices who picked up the room service phone) was so overwhelming kind! They delivered a special, complimentary dessert treat for us: delicious berries dipped in chocolate on a beautiful plate with 'Congratulations' scrawled perfectly in delicate chocolate drizzle. Even though we were just staying one night, and they certainly have more prestigious guests than we, the staff made us feel like we were royalty - the most important couple in the whole place. I got respectfully, knowing smiles from the other staff in the lobby and glowing, genuine well-wishes as we checked out. They made the stay absolutely PERFECT.
