So if you are going to Iguazu Falls in Argentina it is definitely worth the extra cash to spend a night here. And since you are here go the extra mile and pay for a falls view room which is why you are staying a this hotel in the first place. We were on the top floor and it looked like most of the rooms had been very nicely updated. Our room was extremely comfortable. One thing which was very odd was that the central A/C was cut off for about 5 hours over night so it got very very hot in our room. I don't know if this was an exception to the rule or what. Also something that was very odd was a $15 a day service charge if you wanted internet access on an unlimited basis in your room. I thought this was a bit cheap when the room rate is almost $400US a night. The park closes at 5pm and guests are requested to stay on the grounds of the hotel. If you want to go out to eat you have to take a long cab ride to Puerto Iguazu or eat at the hotel. At the hotel they realize they have you by the short and curlies on this so meals are of extremely mediocre quality at about twice the price of meals in town. I suppose this is the cost to the consumer for isolation vacationing. However the breakfast which is included in the room rate, was a buffet of everything imaginable and just about a breakfast feast fit for a king. Something to meet everybodies breakfast pallet in a multitude of varieties. The pool area was not very well kept up. The lounge chair mats were pretty mouldy and all the plants around the area had been very neglected. But we did not stay here for the pool. So there you have it.

Here is the best tip for visiting the falls. Devils throat is the most popular area to visit in the park. The first train leaves to Devils Throat at 8:30 am arriving at 8:45 am and they keep coming with 250 passengers on each train. The platform at DT can only hold maybe 200 people and even at that it's 5 persons deep. So the thing to do if you stay at the Sheraton is wake up and be at the start of the path that is next to the train at 8:00 am (park opening time) and walk the 25-30 min beside the train track. You will beat the first train arrival and be the only people on the viewing platform for 15 - 20 min.
