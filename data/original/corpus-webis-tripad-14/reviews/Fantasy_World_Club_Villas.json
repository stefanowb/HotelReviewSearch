The staff were very helpful and friendly and the pool area a real bonus. The main attraction for us with this resort is that it is so easy to get to all of the major attractions with a short drive along the close-by freeways. We would have no problem in using this resort again on future visits - it is relaxing, clean and a great place to stay.

My grandsons are 5 & 3 years old. We were only staying two nights & three days as we had to get back to the office. The villa wasn't ready when we arrived in the afternoon around 2:30-3:00pm. The front desk girl was very nice & gave us bracelets for the water park & a card to open the gates, so we could use the water areas. However no towels & no changing facilities. My son changed his clothes with the boys so they could use the kiddie water area. We had our suitcases in the car. It would be hard if you had traveled by air, as where would you open your suitcases, as the lobby had no facilities either. It started raining a short time later,( we are Florida residents & expect showers especially in August, our rainy season) everyone had to get out of the water & away from the entire water park area. By this time the boys were wet & in their swim trunks & no towels. I went to the front desk while they were changing as I walked the entire area looking for towels. No one said towels were in the room or you had to bring your own. She went to get me towels & only had 3, mind you we were six people. She informed me she would get more from housekeeping. I went back to the front desk @ least 3 more times & still no towels. Once the rain started & our room still wasn't ready we were told to go to the activity center. Off we went in the pouring rain. We changed the children into their dry clothes in there. The center had some sort of odor which wasn't pleasant. It just seemed like an old age home facility.They had coffee in carafes, no cold drinks. Keuring brewer had \"out of order\". Game center you had to purchase a card then put money on the card. I ran into the lobby several more times to see if our room was ready. FINALLY we got our two story villa. It was clean & nice. I'm not sure what building it was in but it was room 3101. We never did get to use the water park anymore. My son & daughter-in law said neighbors were loud on the outside lanai & they couldn't sleep. We left after one night as the children became sick with high fevers. Wonder if it was from the water park as that's what the Dr. said when she took them the following day. They are still both sick & on antibiotics. It was suppose to be handicap accessible room it was not,I don't think. Be wary as the steps are steep & no room for a wheelchair downstairs. The villas are small. Two bedrooms one with a queen & the other two twin beds. The children slept on air mattress that my son brought but it was literally in the closet area. They opened the doors squeezed the mattress in the open closet & the bottom of the bed. There was NO room to walk in that bedroom & my daughter-in-law is pregnant. No extra pillows for the twin beds. There were two for the queen bed but they had to be used for the boys. Publix very nearby for all supermarket needs. Smokey Bones next to publix wonderful. The location is very good for Seaworld, Aquatica etc.. If you lose your bracelets $25 each, room keys $5 each. We put the braclets on the boys ankles as they were much to large for their wrists & would have definitely come off.", "title": "Weekend getaway with family", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mssee", "date": "August 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 137457060}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Firstly, despite phoning several times before arriving to request that we have one of the refurbished villas, we arrived to find we had been placed in a really old dirty one.

Our group of 3 came to spend almost a week here in Sept, 2011. Thew new pool areas and ammenities are very nice. The unit we were assigned had been remodeled and looked nice, but backed up to a busy road that had service vehicles whizzing by all day starting early. Nice sized screen porch faced this busy road and while there is a wall between porches, this provides no privacy and you can hear everything going on nextdoor. Unit sounded like it had NO soundproofing insulation so we could hear almost everything going on nextdoor for the whole vacation. There is a limit of 6 people per unit, but our neighbors on one side were 7 adults and 2 children and 2 infants. Being on vacation we usually go with the flow, I am a nightowl myself, but when neighbors were partying loudly still at 1 am and we needed to sleep since had busy day planned, I called and reported the loud noise to the management, who said they would have security talk with the people. I never heard or saw anyone come to talk with the neighbors, but guess they could have called. At 3am the party nextdoor was still loud enough to keep all of us awake, so called the management again and they acted like they didn't believe me since suppossedly they had talked with the people, but said they would try again. The next day our group saw our neighbors several times while we were coming and going and spoke with them in a friendly manner to get off to a better start that day. They were not happy with us and gave us dirty looks, acted mad, spoke among themselves in Spanish, which I didn't understand. We felt they were angry enough at us for reporting them and might get confrontational, so we parked our car several spots away from them in hopes of avoiding any further contact. The next morning, we went out to get in the car and found our SUV vandalized. Someone had gotten on top of the vehicle and hit in a downward manner with a sharp object the top of the windshield glass, putting a sizable crack in it. Someone knew what they were doing, intentionally. We called and reported the vandalism to the front desk and they acted like it wasn't thier problem, didn't offer any help or even to look at the damage. When I suggested they or the police talk with the angry people nextdoor, the woman just said to report to the police or to our insurance company. The neighbors checked out early, so they were not around to question. We had to have the whole windshield replaced. At the time it didn't occur to me to ask if there was any survelliance film. There was remodeling construction going on across the complex at the time we stayed and few if any parking lot lights were on especially in front of our building there were not any on. Being an owner, I was upset that the front desk/management didn't seemed concerned about a crime commited on thier property. While we understand it wasn't thier fault, we feel that lack of lighting contributed to the opportunity and wondered what else has happened there that might not be getting back to the Board members or the Insurance company that covers thier property. Hopefully it was a one time thing. You never know who you are renting to or how they might act, but that is why there are rules posted for the general good of the whole complex...could have happened anywhere I guess.", "title": "OWNER says...No soundproofing between units/Noisy neighbors/vandalism, indifferent front desk help", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "DriveMeCrazyinSC", "date": "August 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 137252152}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Everything you needed to make it home from home.
