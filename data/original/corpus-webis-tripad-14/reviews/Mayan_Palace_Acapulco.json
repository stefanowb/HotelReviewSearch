The tennis facilities are remarkable with clay and even a grass court. The hotel was below average. There was a distinct smell and things were in disrepair. Response was very good however. They seemed to want to sell the upgrade and hinted that there would not be any Mayan Palace accomodations in the future. Parts of the Mayan Palace were being demolished. We did not upgrade and were treated respectfully. We had the best taxi driver---we had read about him and made contact and he was amazing. Personal pick up at airport---made a hotel reservation for us for one night, took us on a tour----he demonstrated his pride for his hometown--great english---can't say enough. Contact me if you don't get his info from someone else---Ismael. Also found a great guy doing fishing and boat tours.

Ironically, it's not the place that we stayed at that has finally inspired us to write, but the amazing Alarcon brothers-Roberto and Benjamin. Everything good that you have read about these two is true--and more. You don't need to rent a car or deal with the Mayan's conceirge. These guys will pick you up and take you anywhere, in big, clean air conditioned Suburbans. Start by having them pick you up at the airport and the rest of your stay will fall into place. In no small part did they help make our vacation a very good one. They were a quick study on learning our likes and dislikes, and it took them no time at all to realize that we weren't the typical gringo touristas. They helped us plan our week accordingly. Not only did they make our dinner reservations at some of the best local cuisine restaurants (Su Casa, La Tortuga to name a few), but made sure we were seated at the best tables. If you want a feel for how the real locals party, have the Alarcon boys take you out to La Lomita for a real Mexican Festival. Not only was it one of the high points of the week, but 7 of us ate (the best grilled red snapper and camarones!) and drank and danced into the evening for $120 (including tip! Unlike the vanilla Festival at the Mayan that charges something like $68 p/p). It's important to add that they were very warm and friendly to our children as well. They were great with our kids.

We stayed the first week in April with my wife and our two kids. They loved the pools, especially the water park. THe kids club was nice so they could play with other kids while we soaked up some rays. The weather was beautiful (90 and sunny every day). I would recommend the taxi driver we had, Benjamin. He was great. I arranged to have him pick us up at the airport and we was only a cell phone call away if we wanted to go somewhere. He took us for an afternoon tour of the city ending with the nightly cliff diving show. I can give you his contact information if you would like. He speaks very good english and has an air conditioned suburban. We ate most meals at the resort. THe buffets were a little pricey. A couple days, we walked up to the Mayan Sea Garden and ate at that restaurant which is a little more affordable. The accommodations were a little outdated but we didnt spend much time in the room. The people were all very friendly. The resort is definitely away from the main drag as a taxi into town will cost $15-20 one way. But with kids, we didnt venture far from the resort.

Our suite wasn\u00b4t huge, but it had a separate bedroom with king size bed for us, a full bath and kitchenette with sleeper sofas in the living room. There were two televisions, so the kids could watch one thing while we watched the news! The kitchen had everything-coffemaker, microwave, stove, toaster, blender and all the utensils and dishes we needed as well as a fridge. (Sorry, no oven.) Since we didn\u00b4t have much money budgeted for the trip, we bought an entire week\u00b4s groceries at the nearby Wal-Mart and saved a bundle in eating out. We went on the timeshare tour for a four-person water park pass and 25% off all food and beverages for the week (which we didn\u00b4t need because we didn\u00b4t purchase anything.) In fact, when we checked out, our bill was 18 pesos (about 1.75) for a bottle of water we used when we first got there before getting groceries. The pool wasn\u00b4t too deep (only 3 feet) and so I wasn\u00b4t as nervous about the kids. My son is a beginning swimmer but he could easily stand up in the pool. The beach was amazing-a true paradise. Two people we met there who had been to Hawaii told us it was remarkably similar. The waves were huge and the beach was very clean. (Watch out for the very strong undertow!) The sunset was the most spectacular one I\u00b4ve ever seen. There were many free activities-poolside-as well as a train tour around the grounds and free boats to tour the canals. The Kids Club, though we didn\u00b4t take advantage of it, looked really nice and was economical. They charge 20 dollars a day per child and it includes lunch and activities from 9:30 to 5:30. They did let us join them for a tour of the turtle camp. Over 100 sea turtles had just been born and we and the kids got to take them out of their nests and put them in sand boxes(they were only 8 hours old!) That night at about 2am they were going to release them into the ocean.
