Two rooms, so they can get up to mischief, one big room ,so that none of us get any sleep or privacy, or a suite that may or may not have decent sofabeds.. The Hard Rock Hotel suites solve this problem . As well as the beds in the masterbedroom there are two day beds in the living room that make perfectly good single beds. No, complaints from my mini consumers at all ,and lots of room for all of us. This hotel is excellent for familiies in this predicament. Also its fun. The pool is really huge. (I know everyone says that, but it really is). Cabanas round the pool are worth hiring for a chill out.. Location is very good in the middle of Kuta, with the beach across the road,with a on site Surf school, and tour office. (Of course more expensive than outside, but not a rip off, and you feel that you can trust them with your little dears. ) Breakfast is pretty good, though we ate outside of the hotel most evenings, as it is typical big hotel fare.,and there are many local options. (We liked \"Uns\")The bars are expensive, (fun sitting in the pool up to you tummy in water,and sipping a beer though.)and I wouldn t go to the Hard Rock Hotel looking for a Hard Rock boozy experience.The bands were just ok.

Booked through a travel agent with Singapore Airlines tickets. It is a rather fun hotel by the beach. Had a free welcome drink at centrestage. They have live band there everynight. Breakfast is included and rather good. But got bore of it after 5 days even though they changed it slightly everyday. The deluxe room is clean and spacious. We loved the extra long louge chair in the room. The pool is huge with sandy beach like feature. There's also a pool basketball net and beach volleyball. Cool! There is another VIP pool which is rather quiet but we did not swim there. We did an hour and a half SPA treatment which is great. We also took their surfing class and I manage to surf quite a few waves! Bali is really fun (and cheap with good bargaining).
