The hotel was quiet. I only saw two other people the two nights we were there and that was at checkout. The hotel rooms are dated and the tv's are very little. The shower was okay. The beds are dated and not very comfortable. The pool and hot tub were being remodeled so weren't available. Which was fine. The lady checking us in offered to move us to jordan resort if we wanted a pool. We had issues with our tv remote and called the front desk. Our remote finally started working after 20 minutes and still no sign of maintenance..called the front desk to tell them it was working and they didn't apologize that no one ever showed up. There is a restaurant at the hotel. we didn't eat there though. This is probably a fun place to stay in the winter ski season but I wouldn't probably stay there again in the off season.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ajlangford", "date": "September 28, 2007", "id": 10016326}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Grand Summit at Sunday River the week of July 4th. We stayed in Unit #368. Overall, the room was very spacious and clean. Only 2 complaints about the room: the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable. The sofa bed was more comfortable. And the shower had low water pressure. Other than that, not bad. As timeshare owners, I would expect a comfortable night's sleep and we did not receive that. Helen, in concierge, was awesome! It was cool during our stay so the heated outdoor pool was nice in the evening. Hot tub was decent. We did not eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on that. We brought a portable propane grill to use on our deck but were told they were not allowed. So when we wanted to cook out, we had to cook in the parking lot. You also cannot store your bikes in your room. We had to check them at the front desk each day (which was a hike in itself). Take a hike up the mountain - you may come face to face with a moose as we did. We kayaked on the Androscoggin. There's a small B&B down the street (Briar Lea), I would recommend eating there. If you sit in the bar, eventually you will be socializing with everyone. Also, check out the trails and sights in Grafton Notch State Park. Because of the rainy weather and the fact that we wanted a good night's sleep, we actually left a day early. But overall, I would recommend this property. Sunday River is definately a winter resort as there's not much going on in the summer.

We arrived early, picked up our lift tickets, left our bags at the ski check and we skied from the Summit over to Barker and South Ridge. Upon our return to the Summit, we checked in early to our standard hotel room with 2 queen beds. The room was average hotel quality but very clean and well maintained. The outdoor pool and hot tub were perfect (compared to our past visit when it was too cold). We enjoyed dinner At the Peak! We took the Chandola up to the lodge and had a great dinner experience. Sunday River\u2019s good attempt at fine dining experience on the Mountain\u2026a little over done but it was a fun time with great food and music. We slept well with no neighbors on either side of us or across the hall which was great! (One stay we had banging doors in the hall all night) The buffet breakfast the next day was filling and good quality. The Starbucks coffee hit the spot. I would not recommend paying full price for a stay at the Grand Summit\u2026.but you can\u2019t beat the convenience of staying on the mountain.

We wanted a ski getaway before Christmas. I liked this hotel very much. Check in was great. We arrived in the early evening. There was a lot of snow and it was cold, but a valet parker was very eager to help us out with our bags. We did not valet park but he helped us anyway. Our room was VERY SMALL (studio kitchenette) but nice. We had a room with a Murphy bed. I couldn't get the door to the balcony open but that was probably just because it had snowed over 6\" the day before. The bed mattress was not the best of comfort but what do you expect for a Murphy bed. The kitchen in the room was nice. It had everything we needed to cook our lunches and dinners. The breakfast was AMAZING. It was included in our package and I was shocked at the amount of hot food available in the buffet. There was even a women that cooked an omelet for you. Oh, and the coffee was Starbucks! The pool and hot tub were both outside but you never had to walk out in the cold because they had a feature where you could swim through the curtain that took you outside. I thought this was real nice. Also, inside they had a sauna and steam room.
