One of the many wonderful surprises he had in store for me on this perfect weekend was booking the hotel Europe, as I have always wanted to stay here. It was an amazing experience! Our room was very modern, spacious and had a huge bathroom. The view from our room was just spectacular \u2013hotel is located straight in the city centre, close to the old part of the city. Service was great. If you\u2019ve been in Minsk before you probably noticed that people are wonderful but in the hotels, restaurants and bars quality of service is not the best, you will be lucky to get a smile and don\u2019t expect to hear hello or goodbye. Hotel Europe proved us wrong - our outstanding memory will be of the staff - helpful, knowledgeable and anticipating our every wish. Front desk girls were so brilliant, check in and check out took us less than 5 min and they were delighted to answer any of our questions. Oksana, front office manager, speaks perfect English and has a great sense of humour; she always has a smile on her face. Hotel\u2019s restaurant was quite an experience. The waiters were wonderful and attentive. The food was nice and delicately presented. Bar service was outstanding, great cocktails and selection of wine. Overall we had such a great time that we are already planning our next trip to Minsk and you know where we will be staying :) If you want a bit of luxury and relaxation \u2013 this hotel is a perfect choice. I would recommend this hotel for a romantic week-end or business trip, as the location is spot on.", "title": "Fantastic hotel!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "nadiasmyth", "date": "December 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 22870456, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 staff", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008", "text": "Presently Hotel Europe is the best Hotel in Minsk, far better than the 2 - 3* Hotel Minsk.
