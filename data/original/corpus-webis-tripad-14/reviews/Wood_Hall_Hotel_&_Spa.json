Staff very good and helpful. The main 'niggles' in our room related to the poor lighting. Perhaps meant to be 'mood' lighting but was not sufficient when dressing for the wedding/evening. The only full length mirror did not have a light nearby; the socket I had to use for the hairdryer was not in a comfortable position as I had to use a small mirror. One of the wardrobe lights did not work and no replacement bulb was available in the hotel. The light in the cupboard where the drinks tray was stored did not work but did get replaced, although the working light was not sufficient for the cupboard area. There was no extractor fitted in the bathroom.
