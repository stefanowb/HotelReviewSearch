The lifeguards especially Andrea the last night were very attentive with my children. Watching them even though we were there. We barely missed the wine tasting everynight. Too bad.

A very nice touch, but there was no note or letter from the manager for me to personally thank him/her personally while there.

So thoughtful! Complementary breakfast (our choice, and was excellent- many options and no stale pastry buffet) OR evening wine reception is included, and a really great pet program (next time we will bring the dogs) that was fun for pet lovers, but not intrusive for those who don't like animals. Room was modern...maybe a bit too \"cold\" decor style for my taste. Needed more art, but the furniture was tasteful and in perfect condition.

We had a goldfish put in our room named Hannah, which was a cute touch you don't find everywhere! The rooms and hallways are all very dark, but it made it feel cozy, especially as the weekend was cold and rainy. Rooms are small but nice, and I didn't feel like we were crammed at all. The room service staff was EXCELLENT - we had ordered lunch for the bridal party, and then continued to keep requesting additionals plates, glasses, scissors, super glue, you name it - we asked for it. The delivered each item quickly and with a smile! Its nice to know when you have a million other things going on, that the staff at the Hotel Monaco is there to help you with anything you need to ensure your day goes smoothly. The decor is bright and slightly funky, which made for some great pictures.
