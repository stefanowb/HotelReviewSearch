The hotel's beach was beautiful and you don't get bothered by people trying to sell you things it was very chilled out (the Bajan way) We can strongly recommend this hotel to all. There was also entertainment on every night but we'd definately recommend a night at St Lawrence Gap, especially Jumbies Bar & Restaurant. We also hired a Mini Moke for the day for about \u00a330 and went touring the island. Found a lovely beachfront restaurant at Holetown called Cocomo's where the food, drink and beach were fantastic.
