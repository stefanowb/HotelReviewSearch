We had a goregous balcony room overlooking the Persian Gulf. It was a short walk to the beach with an attentive staff to look after your every need. Every set of chairs had an umbrella and a beautiful view of the ocean. Every night there were little treats on our pillows. The room service was quick and efficient. This hotel is on the same property as the Al Qsar hotel and as such we enjoyed a short walk to their beautiful pool area and restaurants. There are also golf cart shuttles and the abar boats to transport you around the property. Our favorite restaurant was The Wharf where the steak and fish were both excellent choices. The Souk is a shopping and dining venue located between the two hotels and we did all our \"souvenir\" shopping there, plus if you're looking for a break from the cultural cuisine there are some American style fast food places there.
