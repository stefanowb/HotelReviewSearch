However on arival was pleasantly surprised and while check in went with a few minor hiccups, ie being charged too much due to a computer error as well as being sent to a room that wasnt ready and having to check into another on a different floor, staff were quite efficient in trying to resolve the matter. The room was big enough to accomodate myself and my friend and our two young children and was clean and airy and relatively quiet considering its city centre location. The only downfall was on entering there are a number of steps up to reception which is not very wheelchair or pram friendly and its difficult to manage bags and a pram and young children in prams when you go in and out, but staff are helpful if you ask. The breakfast included was very impressive and a fair amount of choice, the waiting staff were very efficient and on the second morning the waitress automatically brought us tea/coffee, remembering from the day before which was a lovely touch and she was very friendly with the children. The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of many shops on Connolly street but also within close proximity of the luas and buses should you wish to go further or reach other landmarks. Overall we were very happy with the hotel and would consider staying here again.", "title": "Good value for city centre loaction", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "shalin35", "date": "June 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 114481937}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I HAD A LOVELY STAY IN YOUR HOTEL , STAFF VERY FRIENDLY . rooms very clean and comfortable, but when i went down for breakfast the room was very busy . i was shocked to see a member of your staff working as a waitress was wearin trainers and a jumper and also here hair was not tied up when she was makin toast were all other staff members were dressed appropiate and looked the part .I COULD NOT BELEIVE WHAT I SAW !

Looking at the reviews it would appear we got one of the better rooms- a Premier Club King Room. We booked it on a hotel booking website and not directly with the hotel and paid 59 Euros. There were signs in the hotel advising to book directly with them for a better deal, however their website states the room we stayed in starts at 95 Euros a night. Aside from that, the room was absolutely brilliant! I couldn\u2019t fault it in anyway. CLEAN, spacious, tea and coffee making facilities, ironing board and iron in the room, large telly with adequate channel selections, shower, bath, hair dryer and the bed was very comfortable. We were a bit travel weary when we arrived by train so the fact it was so close to the train station was a bonus! The staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful. As my husband and I are both smokers so having a balcony was also a bonus. (The hotel we stayed in previous nights you had to get completely dressed, go down 6 floors and stand in the rain. In the mornings we were continuously approached by homeless people wanting money or cigarettes in the evening we had to deal with lout-ish drunks from the pub across the street). But thankfully we didn\u2019t have to experience that at the North Star. We had one meal at McCoy\u2019s bar, 2x burger and chips and 2x cokes. The food and portion size was great, however we thought that 26.50 Euros was a bit steep for burger and chips. The trains are about 100 yards away and run right past the hotel frequently however we are not light sleepers so that noise didn\u2019t bother us. Admittedly the hotel is in what could be a considered a dodgy part of town after dark which may be a bit intimidating to some travellers. However we weren\u2019t put off by that nor is it the hotel\u2019s fault. There is a cash point right around the corner and a Spar shop which I found helpful. We didn\u2019t mind carrying our bags up one flight of stairs to get to reception, can\u2019t believe people moan about that. I\u2019m sure if you are elderly or handicapped the staff were so helpful I\u2019m sure they would be happy to assist.
