The bathrooms were in a state of disrepair and though the cleaning staff had obviously cleaned the fact that the chain has clearly chosen to \"forget\" about this hotel is evident throughout the property. Besides the bathrooms in the suites we stayed in there was evidence of it being a poorly maintained hotel. The carpet in the hallways was hazardous as it has many large ripples, door handles were falling off and the hot tub was broken with no signs of a repair in the near future. The staff were very friendly and willing to accomodate and I genuinely feel the Rodd chain of hotels has cast this one aside.

After calling three motels/inns and finding them all booked, I chanced on the Rodd Mill River, the desk agent who took my call was very sweet and laughed when I was shocked at the reasonable $89 room rate (the lowest rate of our entire trip). I wasn't too optimistic, until we arrived to the beautiful resort. Our room was a beautiful, spacious kind bedded room overlooking the golf course. The room was clean, comfy and as I mentioned, reasonable. My husband thought it was cool that this was the place for \"The Big Break\" (some golf show), but was really ticked off that he didn't have his clubs.

I was excited as this hotel is considered 'fancy' in the area. Overall, I was not impressed at all with the service. The meal and bar service at the reception was great, but there were several other negatives. We stayed at the hotel the night before the wedding and paid extra so that we could check out of the suite anytime the day of the wedding. This was confirmed with the hotel a week before the wedding. Myself, and 3 other bridesmaids had booked rooms for the night of the wedding, and we confirmed with the hotel the week before the wedding, that we would be able to check into the rooms early on the day of the wedding. The reason for this was that the bridal party were all getting ready in the suite the day of the wedding, and wanted to be able to move things from one to another before we left for the wedding. This was also the purpose of paying extra (almost 40% of the cost of the suite) so that we could check out of the suite anytime that day - we didn't want to have to move everything from that room before we left for the wedding. Again, all this was confirmed with the hotel a week before and they assured us it would not be a problem. Needless to say, it was a problem, and NONE of the extra rooms were available for check in before we left for the wedding (1:30 pm). They also informed us we had to be checked out of the suite by 2 pm (which by 2 pm, we were walking down the aisle at the church). So that meant, 2 bridesmaids running up and down the stairs a dozen times moving things out of the suite and into another guest's room (also note - the hotel has 3 floors and NO elevator). This wedding took place in the off season, and essentially the only guests at the hotel that weekend were wedding guests, therefore the issue with the rooms couldn't have been lack of available rooms.", "title": "not very accomodating for a wedding...", "user": "PeiNurse99", "date": "November 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 120514427}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Another issue is the hotel does not have air conditioning.

However, apart of the onsite resort amenities, the rooms are clean and adequate however they are showing their age. I doubt that there has been much in terms of upgrades, and any time/money spent on the rooms was for replacement or maintenance. One might find it easy to wake up in the morning believing that you are in a hotel from the 1990s as the decor and room amenities are certainly not trendy or the latest industry norms. The rooms still feature tube televisions, window A/C units (loud!), wall-paper and a push carpet. However, I must say that the hotel has done a fair job keeping the rooms clean and in full working order. The onsite restaurant is good and fairly priced.
