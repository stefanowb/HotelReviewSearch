It is a beautifully decorated small hotel. Our room was comfortable. We had some minor gripes: We didn't like the pillows and there was no disposable shower cap. The pool area is pretty. The staff was really nice. The food at the hotel's restaurant was very good. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner there. I also had a 60-minute massage at the hotel's spa \"Exhale Spa\" and it was fabulous. Please know that there's only valet parking at this hotel and it costs $20/night.

One of the drivers who took us around several times became like our friend for the week, very friendly and nice. The first impression of the hotel however was a guy (Mike?) who helped us get our bags, took us to our room, and made us feel at ease (since hotels.com screwed up our reservation completely, thanks guys). We got an incredible deal through hotels.com BUT next time I'd probably just keep an eye on the Palomar's website because they offered something like 30% off of room rates for an advanced booking.", "title": "Honeymooners Delight", "user": "tripaj", "date": "October 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 82067997}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room was wonderful. Very nice bed, linens on the bed, couch, tv, etc. My wife forgot a curling iron and they were able to provide her with one. I was able to charge my iphone daily with the provided iHome dock. The wifi was free because we signed up with a free service with Kimpton hotels. They delivered strawberries and champagne for free with a note welcoming us to the hotel for our honeymoon. They were able to recommend incredible restaurants and things to do as well as drive us to many of them (within 3 miles of the hotel, for free). The pool was incredible (we spent a lot of time there): An infinity edge pool, free water, restaurant service available, private cabanas with comfy bed/couches, hot tub, great music, and giant towels. Also, daily they had a wine tasting in the lobby and one day they even had an ice cream bar! My wife and I were very blessed to have found such a great deal for our honeymoon. We've been thinking of excuses to go back because if you stay in a Kimpton hotel 10 nights in a year (I believe it was 10) then you get 2 nights free when you sign-up for the free service (that gets you the free wifi as already mentioned).", "title": "Better Than The Best", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "keejrd", "date": "September 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 80651709}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Complaints, there had to be some!

It was our honeymoon and we could have splurged on the restaurant, but instead went shopping and bought more stuff. If you have the money, it looked very very nice, but I'm enjoying the coat I bought instead! The same goes for room service. PB&J shouldn't be $15. Lastly, the spa attached to the hotel leads you to believe you will receive a free massage session just for staying at the hotel when in the fine print it says you'll receive a free one with the purchase of like a 2 hour massage.
