It is advertised as 5 Star but the room prices you pay are not really five star. We paid about \u00a395.00 per night so we were shocked when it was 3 euros just for a bottle of water. We didn't eat breakfast as this was about 25 euros each. We found a supermarket not far away like most people seemed to do. You never saw many people around the pool with drinks. We did eat at the main restaurant twice and the food and service and the setting were all excellent. The rooms are are clean but a bit like something you would get in an all inclusive hotel in the carribean. Poltu Quatu is a very small port with just a few restaurant (expensive) but the food is very good. Baia Sardinian is a bit more lively and more affordable. You definitely need to hire a car as everything is far away but we didn't as the price we were quoted was 90 euros a day so we got taxis instead. I did enjoy the 8 days we had there but the whole holiday cost us about \u00a33000.00 for a week in Europe! I wouldn't mind if it was a real luxury five star but it wasn't.
