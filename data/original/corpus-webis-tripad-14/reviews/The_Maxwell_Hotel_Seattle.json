There is no complimentary breakfast, but The Maxwell is a very short walking distance to two markets where you can stock up the minifridge, plus there is a limited cafe in the hotel where you can get a quick bite in the morning.

Wide assortment of room types. We stayed in a Prima Donna room, well appointed, excellent value, plenty of space (two very comfortable kings for my wife and me plus my mother and daughter, plus a sleeper sofa with a memory foam mattress that my teenaged son, who while traveling with us usually has to sleep on uncomfortable sleeper sofas, said was very comfortable and definitely the most comfortable sleeper sofa he had ever experienced). The room's corner position gave us partial view (upper portion) of the Space Needle, otherwise unremarkable view out over Roy St., but the proximity (one block!) of the hotel to the Seattle Center complex (Space Needle, Pacific Science Museum, EMP Museum, Monorail (to Westlake Mall and Pike's Market), etc.) and the free parking that every other hotel wanted to charge $20+ a day for, made the hotel a definite Win. Additionally, the lobby was large and well appointed, virtually everything in the hotel was well maintained (see below for the only two exceptions), *all* staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the in-hotel restaurant was excellent (and apparently quite locally popular). The free shuttle service to nearby sites and the free-to-use bicycles were nice amenities, too. My son very much liked the food he got at the tiny breakfast/coffee shop in the lobby, too. The only \"problems\" were slow WiFi and spotty satellite TV service on some channels, but we weren't in the room all that much and were too tired at the end of each day's touring for these issues to have soured our experience. All in all, we found the Maxwell to be a very nice, well-located, great-value, quite enjoyable departure from the usual chain hotels; I would definitely consider staying there again with family, though if I were on business (and on an expense account), I might look for a more upscale chain hotel with better Internet service.", "title": "Hidden gem", "user": "afrinl", "date": "June 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164848858}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "I chose the Maxwell Hotel originally as I got a great deal through Expedia and it had some excellent reviews.

Our king room was nicely appointed and suitably spacious--very modern. However, while the shower was spacious, there was no bathtub. Nor was there a door on the shower, which wasn't a problem for me, but my wife likes it steamy, and instead felt cold drafts. There was also no soap provided, just dispensers of shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner in the shower. The sink area had soap and hand lotion dispensers. Water pressure in the shower was very weak. Wifi worked well, but was slow. While their website noted there was breakfast available, it was really just a kiosk, with vastly overpriced items. Staff was very friendly, but not very well informed. Accurate answers to questions depended on whom you asked. While I was standing around waiting for a computer to free up to print boarding passes, a staff member asked if I needed help. When I told her I was just waiting for a computer to free up so I could print boarding passes, she directed me downstairs where there was another computer. Great, except there was no printer there and I had to come back up where meanwhile someone had grabbed the computer I was waiting for, and so I had to wait some more. When I inquired about a taxi to the airport, I got good infomation on how long it would take for one to show up and how long the ride would be. When I asked another staff member later the same question, he told me it would be better to rent a car and driver, which saved us about $15, so good for him, but not for the rest of the staff. When you print your receipt for your booking, it will not indicate the taxes, which were substantial. And finally, and this is my fault, it appears that the hotel overlooks the square where the space needle is located, but it does not, because there is a parking garage blocking that view. I should have taken a look on Google Earth before hand.

Great value for money considering the shuttle service they provide. The staff looked startled when we enter and I have to say on first sight they are not what you would call friendly but they were efficient and helpful. Perhaps it's just a bit of shyness.
