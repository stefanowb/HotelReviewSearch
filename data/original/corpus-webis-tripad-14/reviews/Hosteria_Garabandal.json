It's not a place people go to otherwise, as it is well off the well-beaten tourist trail. But it is a special place-- beautiful scenery and wildlife; deeply spiritual. And it wasn't as inaccesible (by rental car from Bilbao) as we thought it would be. The Hosteria Garabandal, where we stayed, is a lovely place-- basic accomodations, nothing fancy-- but nothing is lacking, either. The rooms are spotless and very spacious, with fully-equipped bathrooms with shower. The staff (especially the woman who runs the place) is very friendly and helpful. Meals are fresh and delicious home cooking. Our stay here was a highlight of our recent European trip.", "helpfulness": 27, "user": "revjeff", "date": "August 15, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 2450935}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Cantabria", "continent": "Europe", "city": "San Sebastian de Garabandal"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 3}, "slim_ranking": 0.5}
