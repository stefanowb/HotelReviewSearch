Fortunately the majority of our stay was spent in the barn. Our experience of the actual hotel was much less positive. On arriving at the hotel we discovered that our room was being redecorated, so while we dropped our bags off we had to manouvre around a man painting the door, we were also unable to shut the door until going to bed, which meant that we had to leave our suitcase with all our belongings in the room, which anyone could walk into. However, the redecoration was much needed. Our room was horrible, especially the tatty bathroom, and was very grubby - certainly not worth the price we paid for the room. You are much better off booking into a travelodge (although the breakfast here was quite good).", "title": "Over-priced", "user": "vicki1978", "date": "August 23, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 8489280, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Nothing", "disliked": "\u2014 The dirt"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We had a family Reunion here to include cousins from South Africa and cousins I had never met and the staff of the Barns couldn't have been more helpful. We had a lunch overlooking the river for 10 people. The table was beautifully decorated with fresh flowers and the food was very good. We spent the afternoon catching up with family in the snack bar, which we basically took over and again the staff made us so comfortable and even took group photos with eight different cameras! We also had dinner for 7 and a child which was delicious and we were waited on hand and foot. The rooms we had were very comfortable, large and spotlessly clean. I have travelled all over the world and stayed in 5* hotels and this one is hard to beat and the setting is really beautiful.
