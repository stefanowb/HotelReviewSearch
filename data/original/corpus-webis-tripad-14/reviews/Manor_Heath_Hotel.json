It was very clean but our room stank of smoke and all of the corridors had a very overpowering smell of air freshener that will make your eyes water. The rooms are very tiny and the walls so thin that you can hear everything from the other room. The car park is very tight and has a stupid system of forcing you to park in the lowest number available. If you park in a higher number they are straight out telling you to move. If you are unlucky enough to be in space one good luck getting out without scraping along the fence in your way. The spaces are also far to close together to get young children in or out of your car.
