We rented directly through an owner rather than through the rental office at Infinity Bay. We saved about $1000 for the week doing this. There are no accommodations in West Bay that can touch Infinity Bay (IB). Lovely property. The food at La Palapa which is their beach bar/restaurant was very good and very reasonably priced. We got groceries for the week at the Plaza Mar grocery store in Coxen Hole which had an excellent variety but was a little on the dumpy side. The grocery stores in French Harbour are nicer but they aren\u2019t convenient to go to from the airport. There is a variety store which is just a few minutes walk away from IB but keep in mind that it does close at 5pm everyday and is not open on Sundays. The sweetest person at IB is Emmanuel\u2026you will meet him at the towel hut\u2026he takes great pride in his job and many times will even get your towel set up for you and angle your beach chaise just the way you want it. A real super star. George a server at the restaurant and Carlos who is a bartender were great. There was another girl that was really nice at the beach bar as well but I forget her name. There were a few girls working at the beach bar that had a bit of an attitude but we just ignored them and got our favorites to wait on us. If you rent directly through an owner you will receive housekeeping service every 3 days when they will come and clean, give you new sheets, towels, etc however you can request clean towels whenever you need them. You get your beach towels at the towel hut by the beach. You are provided with bare bones things in the condo\u2026just handsoap, one roll of paper towels, one pack of coffee. So if you stop to get groceries on the way to IB keep in mind that you need to buy dishsoap, laundry soap, dishwasher soap, etc\u2026these things are not provided (or stash them in your luggage). I bought a lot of dry light things in my suitcase, coffee, tea, Kleenex (no kleenex will be provided\u2026just toilet paper), crackers, munchies, a couple of rolls of paper towels etc. Our condo only had two dishtowels in it so the extra paper towels came in handy. You may want to consider bringing a small travel reading lamp if anyone is stuck on the pull out couch in the living room as my friend was \u2026it was hard for her to read before bed in there as the lighting wasn't the greatest at night. Our condo only had one lamp and it was in the bedroom. Also a makeup mirror or hand held mirror might be handy. Just one mirror in the bathroom. Some owners probably will have added things to their condo\u2026like makeup mirrors not sure. I was glad I brought a mirror with me as it was helpful for taking my contact lenses out and other \u201cprimping\u201d rituals. Last year we had toured through a condo and the queen pull out mattress in the couch was significantly better ( like 300 % better) than the mattress on the pull out couch in our condo\u2026perhaps owners have a choice of what quality they want to put into the pull out couch??? There were always security people on site and we felt extremely safe and secure there. Anyone who has been there knows that the beach in front is primo and the snorkeling is right there\u2026just swim in and 30 seconds you are on a great reef. You really can\u2019t go wrong staying at Infinity Bay. Would highly recommend this as the best accommodations in West Bay. Every time I walked from our unit to the beach I couldn\u2019t believe the beautiful turquoise colours of the ocean. I was thinking that it wasn\u2019t LIKE a corona commercial\u2026it WAS a corona commercial. Oh and the trip to Cayos Cochinos is a rip off\u2026it is $150 per person and an all day affair\u2026we almost went but then we asked a local person and he said it was BS.He said the snorkeling isn't that great there as lots of rivers drain into the ocean off the coast of Honduras and Cayos Cochinos is very close to the mainland so he said it wasn\u2019t really that great for snorkeling there\u2026so be forewarned\u2026it is a lot of money to spend when West Bay is nicer for snorkeling. Like a lot of Caribbean/Mexico destinations you will be safe and have an \"event\" free holiday if you stick to where there are tourists/other people around\u2026but as anywhere things happen in Roatan too\u2026so use due diligence and don\u2019t be gallivanting off into remote areas by yourself (safety in numbers)\u2026you might have been able to do that in Roatan years ago BUT you can\u2019t do it now. Sign of the times. No matter where you stay please buy add dog food and cat food to your grocery list and buy a couple of bags and feed some of the animals that look starving...especially if you see any outside of West Bay or other places that you might be touring through (i.e. Coxen Hole) . There are some ex-pats on the island doing some good work with the cats and dogs and trying to help them, setting up neutering/spay clinics etc...but if you run into any strays in your travels they will probably appreciate a huge meal just to help them survive another day. Breaks my heart...when we were waiting outside the airport enjoying the extra sunshine when our flight home was delayed I bought 4 hotdogs and 2 chicken wraps for a dog that was at the airport...she was gentle and I could see in her eyes that she was saying thank you...I know that she appreciated the food...when you are there...don't just feel sorry for them and turn a blind eye....please go get some food for them!!!!", "title": "Nice hotel", "user": "bphawk64", "date": "February 3, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 95432890}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed at Infinity in a 1BR condo I rented from a private owner.

They offer free use of their snorkel gear and with a unbelievable coral reef about 25 meters off shore, I only went scuba diving once (through Bananarama Hotel a short walk down the beach). You can see beautiful tropical fish that swarm around you, moray eel and even turtles (lots of people saw them while snorkeling but I only saw one while diving). They also have a $3 water taxi to West End which is great so you can see that part of the island and go to other restaurants, try Tong's Thai Restaurant it's amazing. The food is actually quite good at the hotel, but there are less expensive options down the beach, also try Bite on the Beach. The pool is great with a swim up bar. We met quite a few of the owners and they were all super nice. The only advise I can give is bring lots of bug spray and put it on liberally, all over your body, no joke, any spot without bug spray will get bit. It'll save you from itching.

We wanted a variety of hotels and we definitely got that. IB is gorgeous. The people were great. Carlos, Freddy, and Kevin gave us great service, always happy and smiling. The room was nice, super clean but we didn't spend much time there because the snorkeling was amazing. We brought our own gear and would just walk out from in front of the hotel and snorkel for hours. We saw starfish, turtles, rays, barracudas, and at least 15 different kinds of fish. The fish swam with us and it was absolutely gorgeous. We met Captain Brooks on the beach and he took us deep sea fishing and snorkeling....caught 4 tuna, one was 15 pounds and we all shared it with the kitchen staff at Palmetto Bay. DELICIOUS! We took a water taxi from IB to West End ($3 per person) and ate baleadas ($2 each) at Chapi Catrachas. Delicious local food. Vintage Pearl is a great restaurant, excellent food, wine and service from Christine. We rented a motorcycle from Murray at Captain Van's for the whole week so we could tour the island. The roads are fine, but you do need to watch for potholes, spped bumps, and the occasional stray dog that will wander across the road. The cruise ships are there on Tues, Wed, Thurs, and Fri. That was the only drawback to IB. We had Sunday and Monday quiet and to ourselves, then the waves of people and children came in. Most of them did not snorkel though, so that was nice. They did however put up a big blow-up slide and trampoline for the kids just to the left of the hotel. It was a little annoying if you are not a kid person, plus it blocked the beautiful view. Lots of beach vendors, but they are really nice and not pushy at all. In general, we had a GREAT time, check-in, check-out was smooth and easy and Infinity Bay is a really nice place to go and we would definitely return.
