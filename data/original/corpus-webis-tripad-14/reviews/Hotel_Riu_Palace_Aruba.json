The only thing is dat the C building has French balconys and A and B have bigger balconys. But because of the hard winds not many people stayded on their balcony. The food in the hotel is excellent, we are not really \"buffet\" people, but the buffet here is really great. Also the a la carte restaurants are really good, they have more sphere than the buffet restaurant (because it's really big). The beach is great at the Riu, it looks like if there is more space than at the beach with the other hotels. For example the beach at the Marriot is so crowded. The Marriot is very expensive but if you walk at the beach there it looks like Benidorm, it's really busy there! If i could say one thing that's not so good at Riu than i would say the music at the pool. It was far too loud. If you stay at the swimming pool it feels like you're on MTV.

Make sure to ask your travel agent to give you some form of documentation to get the free DePalms Tours shuttle to the hotel, because ours forgot. We were still able to ride the shuttle (we told them we were on our honeymoon) and all was well. Check-in was painless and we were given a drink immediately upon arrival. We were impressed with our room and with the speedy arrival of our bags. We overslept then spent too long at breakfast the first morning so we missed the dinner reservation timeframe, but were happy to eat at the buffet. My husband really liked all the restaurants and we had lunch most days at the buffet (Don Nicholas) or Nautilus. Everyone was friendly and we met quite a few Americans. When we were there, I can honestly say we only saw three or four children. It seemed to be predominately couples (a lot of honeymooners!). We didn't really venture into the Casino, but the nightly shows were entertaining and the poolside BINGO games were fun. The weather was perfect, which is pretty typical for Aruba, and it only started to storm a little as we were checking out. The only excursion we did was the Pirate Ship snorkeling/rope swing adventure and we loved it!
