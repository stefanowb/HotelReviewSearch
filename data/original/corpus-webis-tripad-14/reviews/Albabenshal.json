Each and every room is unique and large. All rooms are on different levels. The dining experience is fantastic and the best part of staying here. You eat your meals on the roof terrace overlooking Siwa. The fire burns in the evening to take the chill off. The food is sublime and so much of it. The waiters cannot do enough to please you. The chicken, the pita, the olives, the potatoes, the soups, vegetables, the deserts, jams, the goat cheese, etc. It is all heavenly. Ever heard of olive jam? Wonderful.
