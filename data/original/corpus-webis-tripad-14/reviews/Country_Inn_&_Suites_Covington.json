After I checked out of the room I was told I had a dog in my room and was charged a 200 pet fee. I NEVER had a dog in my room and have only been sent a photo of a stain that was in the room when I got there. The staff are very unprofessional in handling the mess, they say they will return phone calls and don't ,claim they are the manager and they aren't and their story keeps changing. We wish they would just listen to REASON! Please do NOT support this hotel. And just in case you take the chance please make sure you leave your room clean or you might be charged as being as filthy as animals!", "user": "J M", "date": "May 16, 2012", "id": 130056048}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Hotel", "text": "This is a great hotel with a fabulous and caring staff.

Made several trips downstairs and checked every time we went in and out and only had cookies available about 10% of the time. How are we supposed to have our bedtime snacks??
