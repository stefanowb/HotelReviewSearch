The staff are real Papuan natives and extremely friendly and accommodating. There is a South African couple in charge, and they make everything seem effortless. One has to understand that this is FAR off the beaten path and supplies etc. are not easy to get. The owner has carved out a piece of heaven from the jungle in the most beautiful spot on earth. The food was excellent, the dive-staff could not speak English, but they were 'superman' below the surface. We had a sensory overload on every dive. We had never seen so many fish; not to mention the amount of mantas at manta point. The only 'annoying' thing was the many live-aboards that 'camped' on our doorstep, because the best dive-sites in the Raja Ampat are literary minutes away from our doorstep.", "user": "naturaldiver", "date": "April 14, 2010", "id": 61272595}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "heaven on earth", "text": "The bungalows are massive and right on the beach.

The staff is very friendly and the dive masters know all about the landscape underwater. They all worked incredibly hard to make sure we had a good week. The food was plentiful and Max (the owner) shared most meals with us. Max is really making a difference in many people\u2019s lives. The reefs are pristine and because not many people are willing to make the long journey hopefully they will stay that way.

And indeed, it is really fantastic, small scale diving tourism, maximum 10-20 people in Sorido and about the same in the sister resort Kri Eco. Maximum 6 people in a boat with 2 dive guides and 2 supporting people on the boat. It is really luxury. The resort on the small island Kri is very well setup, excellent service, nice bungalows, clean, breakfast/lunch/dinner together with other guests, very good to get to know each other and to chat. I really liked the fact Max Ammer works together with local people. The staff is mainly Papuan, the dive guides as well. And the diving is really fantastic, you can see a lot, a lot of fish, coral, 'small stuff', a large diversity in sea life. It is difficult to say, that this is the best dive site in the world. I do not like these superlatives. But surely, Raja Ampat is extraordinary. There are only few points of 'criticism'. The food is a bit lopsided, even if you accept the difficult logistics. It is chicken or fish (sometimes beef), very small diversity in vegetables, no special food for vegetarians and no shellfish. There was a 'funny' anecdote, a cuttlefish jumped coincidentely into our boat. And the Papuan on the boat was really happy to cook this cuttlefish in the evening, because he would not get this kind of food from the resort kitchen, which follows the 7 days adventist rules (no shellfish, cuttlefish, et cetera).", "title": "Fantastic diving, nice resort, excellent service", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "omier", "date": "April 12, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 103813568}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled with friends", "text": "But the desserts, fruits were very excellent.", "title": "Ecotourism at its best - amazing reefs, amazing views, amazing people.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "RandiDR", "date": "March 17, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 100453371}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "A second point of attention: I missed a bit expertise about marine life from the dive guides.

The man behind this gem of a place, he pioneered ecotourism in Kri (Raja Ampat). I have been diving on coral reefs for 11 years and the Sorido Bay \"house reefs\" are among the best in the world. From pygmy seahorses to manta rays to 100% coral cover, you will be thrilled with the underwater scenery. Above water is just as pretty - Max has created ocean-view accommodations dotted with authentic Papuan artwork, and ever convenience (eco-friendly, of course!). The food is incredible, the dive guides are phenomenal, and the diving is world-class. Max is a delight, and his resort epitomizes simple elegance. The boat ride from Sorong is the only downside - cramped and long, it is not the most pleasant experience. However, 1 bad boat ride is COMPLETELY worth the fabulous experience at Kri - I have never written a report this glowing before, but this place deserves every accolade.
