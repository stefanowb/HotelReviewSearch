Just off la Ramblas down Hospital St, the exterior is glass and cream stone with a really modern look. Good security, you have to press buzzer to let you in (security man in background at night). When you walk in, it's so quiet and peaceful, long reception desk and easy check in, staff were polite. Good lifts that arrived quickly at all times of day and night. Rooms are ultra modern again and so clean, the whole hotel is almost sterile, I've never stayed in anywhere so pristine. The rooms are ultra modern again, with a massive bed and crisp white linen. The decor and curtains are lovely and modern, the floor is a grey resin sort of floor that matches the modern decor, so don't be expecting a plush carpet! There is a double sliding wardrobe and shelving that contains an easy to use free safe and also a good sized fridge that contains the mini bar at very reasonable prices, but if you're stingy like us, you can put your own stuff in there. There are two white bedside tables and a matching larger one opposite with a big mirror above. There is a flat screen TV on the wall. The bathroom is excellent with quality white modern fittings set in a cream stone, a good sized mirror and excellent lighting. There are some nice touches like an extendable mirror, hairdryer and lots of toiletries and bits and pieces like nail file and shoe shine, in fact I've had lesser things in some four star hotels I've stayed in. Lots of white towels. There isn't a bath but the shower makes up for it, it's so big you could could fit three people in it and easily the best shower I've ever come across. Fab air con as well.

Don't get a taxi from the aiport as they can be very costly. Come out of the aiport , go left and walk to the Aerobus stop. It's 5 euros to Plaza Catalunya, the big square at the top of La Ramblas. It announces the stops in different languages so you know exactly where you are. About 30 mins on the bus, get off and walk straight down La Ramblas and Hospital St is on the right, a good walk down. Coming back, go to the square again and get a Terminal 1 or 2 bus and they run approx every ten mins. The open top bus is a great way of seeing the city, it has red, green and blue routes and you just hop on and off as you please. You can spend all day on this if you wanted and it costs 22 euros or 29 for a two day ticket. It's so worth it as there is so much to see and it's a brilliant way of seeing it all. The whole system is so well organised and you hardly wait anytime for the next bus to come along. Shopping is fantastic and so are the many restaurants and bars, all serving quality food. The market off La Ramblas is so colourful and vibrant and you can buy ready prepared fruit and freshly squeezed juices which are great after nights out.
