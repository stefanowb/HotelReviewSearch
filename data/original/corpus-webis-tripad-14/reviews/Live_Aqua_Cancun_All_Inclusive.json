Thanks to everyone on TripAdvisor for all the great comments on this Hotel. You reviews helped us pick this hotel and gave us great tips. I've been to Cancun 3 times in the past and each hotel has been nice (all 4* and up) but this is now my favorite! Here are my thoughts. When you walk into the lobby this wonderful spa smell greets you. Instantly you start feeling relaxed. Everything was very clean, fresh, and well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful. The front desk made sure we got a room we were happy with (we booked an oceanview and they originally offered us a 1st floor room. The front desk lady took us to the room to see it first, but due to the trees you could barely see the ocean. She then found us another room on the 2nd floor which was perfect). Rooms were not large but plenty of space for 3 ladies to share. Beds were very comfortable and had both feather and foam pillows so you could pick your preference. We stopped in the lobby to smell the 5 scent choices and picked our favorite. It was so lovely to be greeted by our chosen scent each time we entered our room. You can hear people who talk loudly in the halls (but in Mexico everything is glass and tile and anything that absorbs sound is going to absorb moisture and go bad faster) but the hotel was not full of crazy party types). We couldn\u2019t hear anything from the rooms around us, just the hall and very infrequently. They have 8 or so pools and most were different temperatures. Unfortunately we had 2 cooler days (not Live Aqua's fault but I know they would have tried to fix the weather if they could have!) and enjoyed the heated Club/Bar Pool and hot tub (not super-hot which is perfect for Mexico). The waiters at the pools were so good - fast and accurate and always smiling. We were a little concerned the first night at the skill of the bartenders due to so-so drinks at the indoor bar on the lower level (bar name escapes me) but the bartenders outside at all the pool bars \u2013 swim-up, swing and main pool - were AWESOME!!! Manual, Oct.... , Leonardo, Saul made the best drinks, shots and were so much fun. They came up with fun shots and new drinks based on our likes. The 30+ rainbow shot run that domino'ed into the glasses of Sprite was soooo cool. Now let me tell you about the food. When you go to an all-inclusive the food is often pretty and nicely presented but boring or ehhh.., but not here. Everything from the buffet at breakfast, to the restaurants, to the pool service, to room service was actually really good. We were so happily surprised. No the steaks are not $50 a steak prime, but everything had nice flavors, well cooked - tender when it should be, and well-seasoned. Ask and you shall receive at Live Aqua. Thank you to all the staff - I hope to come back with my husband in the near future (as soon as I can find someone to watch the kids). Also the people who roll all the towels can really roll them tight so don\u2019t get in a rolled towel fight.", "title": "Wonderful - best stay I've had in Cancun", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Bridget M", "date": "March 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153953080}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013", "text": "We had an excellent time. The staff at Live Aqua was always professional and friendly. Their mission is truly to make your stay an enjoyable one. Being all-inclusive they do it without the expectation of tips and instead are driven by a strong community sense of pride. They took extra steps to make my birthday special including sending a birthday cake to our room, and on a separate occasion decorating our room with balloons and confetti. This was done without request. I can only surmise that one of the front check-in staff noticed my \"Dirty 30\" birthday shirt. That is a ridiculous level of attention to detail that this place provides. Rooms were spacious, AC was cold, be prepared! Food was top notch, although deserts could be improved. Perhaps they lacked a sweetness our American tongues are accustomed to. Everything was first class. Perhaps the only thing missing was some evening programming to provide diversity to the nights. At other all-inclusives they held events to help couples mingle and interact or offer live entertainment, ie. mariachi and trio bands. Nights basically turn into meeting at the upstairs bar/lounge and DJ on staff did an excellent job of playing a mix of music.

The pool area is outstanding with many choices and has about 8 different pools. The Azul bar was very nice and the food outside was great! The hotel restaurants served great food as well, both a little pricey and would have liked to have had one choice that was more child and family friendly for a casual dining experience though as both were more upscale.
