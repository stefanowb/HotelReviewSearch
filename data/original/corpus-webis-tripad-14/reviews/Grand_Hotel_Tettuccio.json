From this small town we used the trains to see Florence, Lucca, Pisa, Cinque Terra, and other small Tuscan Villages along the train line. The hotel looks just like the website, however they must have used a wide angle lense! That's okay, rooms in Italy are small. Room was clean, house keeping very excellent. Front desk staff, professional but not friendly. Morning breakfast was awful and after 3 days we stopped going down. Not much food to choose from and what was there was poor quailty and cheap. What was odd about this hotel is there is nothing in the room! No clock /radio and when I asked for one I was told \"no\". (we forgot ours!) No directions on how to use the phone, no book on the hotels offerings, no phone book, no directions on the TV....nothing. Very odd. I would have thought they would have had a book with everything about the place in the room, but they don't. Room was very clean, and view out to the main street was nice. I know we were there off season, and I have a feeling all the guests staying were on the same floor, which was the 3rd floor. Location perfect and this is a great little town if you don't have a car and just are going to use the train system, which is a perfect way to fit in and live like a local.", "title": "Some great things & some real bad things!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lawin4cr", "date": "November 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 50206161}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "The mini refridgerator never real cooled the drinks down and they do have some items in there, but don't buy anything from there. 3 euro per soda!!
