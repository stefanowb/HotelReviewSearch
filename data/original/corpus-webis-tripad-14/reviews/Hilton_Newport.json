I had 2 excited children who were expecting their Dr Who items to be waiting in the room for them. The room was booked for 2 adults and 2 children but only had towels and cups for 2. The \"deluxe\" room had no bathrobe, no wine, no shower gel, no milk. There was a hole in the sheet in one of the beds and the shower curtain was filthy.

The telephone was dirty and room had no atmoshpere or ambiance. The bed was comfortable though and I did get a good night's sleep! The breakfast was good - everything you could wish for.
