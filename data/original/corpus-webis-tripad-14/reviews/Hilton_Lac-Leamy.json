The check in was quick and easy and express check out was even better. The hotel has a beautiful indoor and outdoor pool. The Casino is attached through a walkway and is lots of fun. Even though I lost lots of money at the casino the hotel and week-end was still fun. The restaurant \"Arome\" at the Hilton is wonderful.
