Upon checking in, the man was extremely friendly, and made a point to say hello each day we were there. I got a very good price on priceline, which made it even better. The only complaints I have are that housekeeping did not do a very good job, the bartender was very rude to me, and the 2nd floor hallway was sweltering hot. Our room was clearly not vacuumed very well the 5 days that we were there. They did not replace tissues or toilet paper on one day, and they didn't clean the bathroom floor the entire time we were there. The coffee and condiments were not replaced, nor were the drinking glasses. There were 4 of us in the room, and everyday we had to ask for an extra towel because we were only provided with 3. The housekeeper couldn't understand what we were saying, and it was fairly frustrating. I don't know if the A/C was broken in the hallway on the 2nd floor, but it was really hot. One evening I went down to the bar to get a glass of wine. The bartender was busy talking with 2 other employees, and seemed irritated that I was \"bothering\" him. I ordered a $10 glass of cheap zinfandel; no thank you, no have a nice evening, nothing. I should have pulled that tip out of the glass, but I didn't. The pool here was very nice, and the lifeguard was friendly.", "title": "Nice hotel, but they do need to review housekeeping and staff ...", "user": "Ercokat", "date": "July 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 115397430}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "$10 for wireless internet... unbelievable", "text": "This hotel charges for wireless internet.

No problem with that since we knew that going in, but wifi was $10/day for each device--we thought all of them would be covered with the one rate. Kind of a pain. My husband ended up using his laptop in the lobby, where wifi is free. We had a long drive and were looking forward to using the indoor pool when we arrived at 9:30, but it was closed for maintenance. We asked if we could at least use the hot tub, and we were given special permission to do that. Management should follow the posted hours (pool was supposed to be open until 10 PM). The desk staff were very courteous. Rooms were large and beds were comfortable. The AC was noisy and kept going on and off through the night-luckily I used earplugs, but my husband didn't and woke up a lot. Bathroom was small. Breakfast was not included and we thought it was pretty pricey, so we ended up eating elsewhere. If we are in the area again, I would probably choose to go to the Hampton Inn in Marlborough. The Hampton includes free wifi (for every device!) and breakfast, and the rooms are just as nice, so the money we saved through the Hotwire rate at the Doubletree was spent on internet and breakfast, making it a wash.", "title": "Nice hotel, but a few problems", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "StJohnFan", "date": "September 18, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 118264796}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled on business", "text": "During a business visit to the area, we were put up in the Doubletree Westborough.
