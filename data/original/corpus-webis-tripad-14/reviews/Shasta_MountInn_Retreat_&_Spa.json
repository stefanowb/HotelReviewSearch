Not only is David an amazing host and chef, he is wonderful to talk to and makes a very comfortable space to be in. My boyfriend and I were spoiled and had the entire place to ourselves the first few nights, but even with other people in the house (on our 3rd night) it did not feel crowded. The beds are INCREDIBLE (both my bf and I got one when we went home), the entire house is clean and the breakfast area is very comfortable. Every room has a gorgeous view of the mountain, there is a very cozy/intimate 2 person hot tub and a sauna on the property. Staying here saved me my insanity during the holiday season.

We slept better there than we do at home. The outdoor swings were so nice to sit in and sitting in the jacuzzi felt great for our sore muscles.

The relaxation room had these great leg massagers, and there were dvds, books and even gloves and a ball to toss around on the lawn.
