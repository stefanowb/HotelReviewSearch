I could see the beach from my room, an outstanding view, without mentioning the breakfast in the top floor. Staff is very friendly, the problem is that you need them more than you would like. The hotel building looks to be an old apartment building, with small rooms, old furnishing and mostly everything requiring some restoration.It is clean, breakfast is good enough. It looks overpriced, but in fact, almost everything in Copacabana is overpriced. It has triple rooms, which is good if in family vacations.", "title": "It could be much better, deserves some restoration", "user": "Pianta", "date": "June 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164995638}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Location very good basically a block off Cococaban a Beach.

There is no car parking which was a real pain as I had to find a space in the side street and keep the parking tickets up to date as well as pay the street minders over night. The hotel itself was ok but in need of a bit of an update. The desk people were friendly and informative but the door staff did not lift a finger to help with the bags or even open the door for which i guess they are employed to do so. One guy was on his mobile for the entire length of out stay. We only had breakfast which was good. We did not eat at the restaurant an the first floor as we ate out. it was a shame they did not utilize the top floor breakfast room as a night time bar as the views were excellent form there. It was an ok hotel but you pay for the location and not the service.There is no pool or fitness room at this hotel.", "title": "Hotel Debret - Rio de Janeiro", "user": "Frank M", "date": "March 31, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 156188371}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I stayed one week, 3th floor room was fine .
