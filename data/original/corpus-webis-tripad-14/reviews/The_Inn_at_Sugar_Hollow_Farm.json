Fantastic food just 15 minutes away in cozy downtown Crozet...several top-of-the line resturants without the crowds. We booked the Shenandoah Suite for added privacy...perfect! Extra touches in the room were pleasant surprises--refrig stocked with drinks, calling card, coffee & hot chocolate, popcorn, etc. Great information from the inn keepers for folks like us who aren't familiar with the area; no matter what you're looking for, Dick & Hayden know where to send you. We didn't mind having breakfast with the other guests, although this may detract from the experience for others. Bottom line--if you're looking for a quiet, clean, relaxing place that's outside of town, a place surrounded with beautiful scenery and wildlife, a place with outdoor activities and great food just around the corner, a place that's only a 20 minute country drive away from downtown Charlottesville, then this is the place for you.", "title": "Just what we were looking for!", "user": "WorldTravelers001", "date": "July 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34462211}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and the attention to detail.

I will always remember his boyish smile and his laugh, his graying red hair and those blue eyes that forever looked into my soul.
