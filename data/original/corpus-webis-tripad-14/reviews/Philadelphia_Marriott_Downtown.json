As we were giving her directions and pointeing out where she should go, her boyfriend who was sitting on the other side of the couch - with his back backing to us - slipped his hand through the couch cut out (which he had conveniently draped his dry cleaning over to obscure his hand movement from his side of the couch to ours) and removed my wallet from my purse. We didn't realize this of course until an hour later when I went to buy a cup of coffee and my wallet was gone. After calling my credit card companies and finding out thet my cards were being used at that very moment at several shops in the mall next to the hotel, I went personally to those shops and asked for a description of the person or persons who had used my cards. Each store gave me the same description of the woman I spoke with at the hotel and her boyfriend carrying the drycleaning (one shop even offered me the video footage of them using my card).", "title": "Location and great service", "user": "smokemon", "date": "June 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 17221198, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Staff, location, rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 fee for internet use"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "When I reported this to hotel security, they informed me that the area I was sitting in was not monitored by the security cameras and was located in a spot that was easy for \"undesirables\" from the street to gain access.
