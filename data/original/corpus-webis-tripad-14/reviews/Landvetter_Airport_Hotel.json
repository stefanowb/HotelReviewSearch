{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 185, "name": "Landvetter Airport Hotel", "reviews": [{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Avoid -- Unreliable and unprofessional", "text": "I reserved a room after negotiating a short-stay rate for 745 SEK (for arrival at 11PM and departure at 5AM: my flight was at 6:30AM). The reservation clerk asked for, and I gave, my credit card number (a standard procedure for a late check-in). But when I arrived at 11PM the night (May 23), the desk clerk told me that my reservation was canceled, allegedly because the clerk who took my reservation mistakenly gave the wrong rate (the excuse was that he thought I was to arrive at 11AM, not 11PM \u2013 but why did he ask for my credit card number for a daytime arrival?). The night clerk then told me that I should pay something like 1550 SEK, not the 745 SEK promised initially \u2013 although she acknowledged that the reservation clerk made a mistake! Had I known that my reservation was invalid, I could have stayed in a downtown hotel which offered $600 SEK rate for the same service. But I could not go back, because the airport was 30-minute drive from downtown and taxi costs 350 SEK one-way. I refused to be \u201chad\u201d by the hotel, and took the only other option of staying at the airport since there was no other hotel at the airport. I think these guys think they can do whatever they want -- like canceling low-rate reservations when there is shortage of rooms -- because they have the only hotel on the airport.

I arrived and went to check-in and asked could I have a room with a double bed but the receptionist advised that she only had a single as they were full. I was directed down the corridor to a room on the ground floor - room 171. This was a small single room, but in fairness had everything I needed although the bed was a single bed with one side against the wall which I hate. The room was stifling hot when I arrived, so I turned off the radiator to let in a little air to cool the room down. I did some work and then went to close the window as it was 0 Degrees, but the radiator still seemed hot. I closed the window and tried to get to sleep, but the combination of the room heat and the heavy duvet made this very difficult and I tossed and turned for two hours. I called reception and they advised that there was nothing they could do and were very unsympathetic and just told me to leave the window open even when I mentioned about the cold and the aircraft and other noise!
