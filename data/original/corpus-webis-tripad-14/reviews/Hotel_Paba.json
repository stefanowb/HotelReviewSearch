First of all it is a total steal for Rome. The location is AMAZING... just a block from the Roman Forum and only a few blocks from the train station. We actually walked from Termini one day. It took about 20 minutes but was all downhill. Also, the two women who work there are so sweet. They spoke very little English but with our broken Italian we got by just fine. They even called our long lost Italian relatives to help set up meeting them. Our room was massive and very clean with a sitting area, walk-in closet and bathroom. Nothing fancy but lots of space.
