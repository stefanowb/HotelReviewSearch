I do alot of traveling for work and I have stayed in a wide variety of hotels, but this trip was for pleasure so I looked into B&Bs in the St Albans, VT area. The website for The Inn at Buck Hollow Farm was easy to use and had some great pictures of the Inn and the setting. We went in October 2008 and the fall foliage was unbelieveable. My sister, my daughter and I, all stayed in the foliage room. It was small but very homey. It had it's own bathroom and had a nice, large, comfortable bed. The television is tiny, but who stays at a B&B to watch TV? The room had a very country feel to it. They also had a sunroom that was open for everyone to use and an outdoor hot tub that my daughter and I had all to ourselves. I almost forgot to mention that the grounds for the Inn are wonderful for a morning hike. It was just a short drive from The Inn to Burlington, VT, which is a wonderful city to visit. It is also close to St. Albans, Vt which is a quaint little town where many of my family members were born. Brad and Jacquie were wonderful hosts and made you feel right at home. Jacquie's cooking is fantastic and I am an extremely picky eater, so I'm not easy to please. She served a homemade, delicious breakfast every morning that we were there. I wanted to stay an extra day, just so we could have one more breakfast before we had to leave!
