The food was perfectly good and well worth going for. If I had any complaints, and they are minor, the service was a little slow.

It's well placed for touring, and the nearby road quietens at night. Breakfast was very good, and our room had a settee so somewhere to sit other than the bar in the evening. No noise at all could be heard from the bar. Bed very comfortable. Food was good, but not cheap. The house wine was watery and thin, pay the extra pound and get a far better bottle.

Already a well known and very busy restaurant, there are now four brand new hotel rooms, all en-suite, with free internet, Sky TV, and all those little things you expect from an AA Four Star Highly Commended facility. Our food also has an AA award. Real ales and an ever changing menu, both as local as we can make them."}
