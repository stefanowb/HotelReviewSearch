Well, it's just not my scene, that's all. I like modern, chic, minimalist and this is the polar opposite. But that doesn't mean it's bad. On the contrary, the service element was lovely if somewhat too intense for my liking. There was a porter at every corner if you know what I mean. But they were lovely so I really can't complain. If you are looking for that Woody Allen 'Midnight in Paris' feel, look no further. I went for a run around Villa Borghesia which is right beside the hotel - lots of lovely hills and magnificent views of Rome, but it was all those couples making out in broad daylight that made me surmise that Rome remains the true city of love... Back to the hotel. Room I was in wasn't that big and not particularly impressive (when compared against similar type venues such as Excelsior) but again, the service level, such as turn-down service, bedding etc. was excellent. Extras cost the earth but that is the norm around here (\u20ac8.50 for a cappuccino). Wifi was \u20ac15 but free in the lobby (wow something for free close to Via Veneto...).
