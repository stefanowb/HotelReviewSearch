The room was very nice, clean, and had a great bed and shower. There was a nice chair & ottoman in the room that was incredibly comfy. Also had a desk, and TV cabinet - no refrigerator.

We park at the Smart Park by the Pioneer Place mall, which is about 2 blocks away. Most stores will validate. One time we stayed for 2 nights and our parking the whole time came to $13. The rooms are nice, the bar is good (for a hotel bar), the buffet is great, and I LOVE the fitness room. It's also a block from Nordstrom's (my favorite!) and next to Peet's coffee. We walked everywhere so it was nice to not use our car. I definitely recommend this hotel - we've stayed here about 8 times and have never had a bad experience. Plus, when you shop downtown there is no tax!!! One time we took the train down (which was okay, not sure if I would do it again. It took 4 hours from Tukwila because it was stopped for 30 min. in vancouver each way). Our father-in-law picked us up when we arrived and he left his car in the valet area for 15 minutes and they were really nice about it.
