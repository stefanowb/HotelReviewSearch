The price was great, the location perfect and the extras provided by the hotel (beach mats/chairs, coolers, snorkelin gear, etc) terrific. We stayed in February, and I would say that you definitely want a/c for maximum comfort. We did not find the tile floors to be exceedingly warm as did a previous reviewer. The room was very large and had a queen bed and two twin beds (we put them together for a double bed). It also had a dining table and chairs, a spacious counter area with sink, coffee pot (and Kona coffee!), microwave and refrigerator. It was definitely large enough for the four of us and would be ideal for parents with two children. The room was slightly dated, but very clean.", "title": "Good price, nice extras", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "H2Opia", "date": "February 27, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3233117}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good and Bad - read on and you decide", "text": "The location is great for exploring the island.

The place we were at, Kuhio Shores (no A/C), did not have room when our stay was up (Don't stay there in the summer-you'll be sorry!). The first room at the Garden Inn, downstairs, was pretty awful. Old, worn-out, etc. Just plain BAD. We got an \"upgrade\" to an upstairs room that was larger, a little nicer looking, and had AC! (It was humid!) But, we found evidence of roaches. So, unless your desparate for AC and want a really low price, $75.00, stay there; otherwise, find something else.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "Smiths", "date": "December 12, 2002", "id": 823211}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 34, "very good": 76, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 206}, "aka": "Garden Island Hotel Lihue", "slim_ranking": 0.111111111111, "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "The Garden Island Inn is a quaint, affordable boutique hotel by the lovely Kalapaki Beach and Bay, the Kauai Marriott and Lagoons and the Nawiliwili Harbor.
