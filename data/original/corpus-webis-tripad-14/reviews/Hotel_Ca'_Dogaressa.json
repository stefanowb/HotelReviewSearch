The area is so great because it is a little less touristy than near St. Mark's so the prices are better too but it is still an easy walk to all the major sights. One of our favorite meals in Venice was 2 blocks away on the same street at the Gam Gam. Awesome falafel and shawirma! We went back twice! Our room was beautiful and clean. Guests can go down to the breakfast room for breakfast or have it sent up to their room which we did and it was so great to eat breakfast in bed. Good food too.

Breakfast served by the very charming Paolo can be taken outside by the Canal if warm enough and luckily enough it was for us on the Sunday morning. Fabulous breakfast with warm brioche, juice, delicious coffee and we were able to eat the fruit we had bought in the market earlier - try the peaches as they were like nectar! As mentioned, Paolo is a great host and nothing is too much trouble and we were treated like royalty!! The hotel is in a fantastic, quiet area that is well worth exploring in it's own right and very close to the Jewish Ghetto but it is also only a 20 minute walk to St Marks square and very close to a number of vaparetto's. Burano is well worth a trip as it is so pretty but the best way to enjoy this beautiful city is to walk, walk and walk and wonder off down the quiet back streets and canals. The hotel can be easily reached by taking a number 5 bus from the Airport and walking from the Bus Station - you can also buy a joint bus and vaparetto pass for the number of days you are staying, which proved very cost effective.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by Gianpaolo, the owner, who showed us to our first room, which in and of itself was a beauty. As we were getting settled, he stopped in to offer us an upgrade to one of the suites on the second level, overlooking the canal. His reasoning was that we should not be distracted by the noise of the check-in desk and the eating area (which the room was sandwiched between) and hence, offered us a more spacious suite with larger bed, stand alone closet/bureau, a large sitting area with pull-out bed, and a luxurious bathroom with spa tub. He told us he would keep the same price as the other room - we had booked the night before on an online website and were only there for one night. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the main thoroughfare that connects you to the rest of the island. The only drawback I could say we had was that it is located opposite the majority of the attractions, hence a longer walk. For some this may not be an issue (it really wasn't for us). Gianpaolo's wife, Graziella, offered us a great suggestion for lunch, where we had one of the best meals in our 10-day excursion of Italy (and that included visiting other cities like Rome, Florence, and Bologna!) Their hospitality in the morning during breakfast and at check-out were beyond all expectations. Fresh squeezed orange juice, homemade croissants, offers for cappuccino or American Cafe, etc. all added to the feeling of welcome.
