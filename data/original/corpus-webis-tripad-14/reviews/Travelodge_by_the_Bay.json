We checked in and our room was ok. It's one of those rooms that you can't really find anything wrong with but you just don't feel quite comfortable. At bedtime we could not sleep because the walls are paper thin and the guy beside us was snoring sooo loud we felt like he was in bed with us. We tried sleeping the opposite way on the bed, but no luck, so eventually we had to call front desk and switch rooms. (I have never done this before!) They gave us a way nicer, cleaner, quieter room the second time. It was fine, and if my original experience was the second room I would have a lot more nice things to say. It wasn't fun carting suitcases at 11:30pm.. but oh well. The next day we were able to walk to most of the famous downtown sites from our hotel. Walking distance to the Crookedest Street, Pier and cable cars. I guess we paid more for location.. because I wouldn't say it was a $100 room!", "title": "You get what you pay for!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SparklySilver", "date": "April 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 15171159}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "San Francisco"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 52, "average": 140, "very good": 170, "terrible": 18, "excellent": 86}, "aka": "Travelodge By The Bay Hotel San Francisco", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333}
