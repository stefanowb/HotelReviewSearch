I travel quite a bit for work and I often travel with my dog and this is by far the best place to stay. If you are looking for an alternative to the standard hotel stay with the big crowded lobbies, noise, too many people and constantly waiting for the elevator then this is your place. It feels like you are in an apartment not a hotel room. The furnishings are very generic but very clean and comfy and the beds and bedding are very comfortable too. I love having my own coffee maker,refridge and microwave so I can do my own cooking if I choose. The only downside is the hotel is in an area that is mostly businesses so there is really nothing to walk to but the beach, some great beach towns and freeways are a short drive away. The positive side is its really quiet at night.", "title": "My favorite Residence Inn............Home away from home", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "bellabellabella", "date": "October 20, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5973800, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Big rooms, quiet grounds, cleanliness, pet friendly", "disliked": "\u2014 I have stayed here 3 times and all have been good stays"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "we stayed here mid Sept for 3 nights after a flight from Hawaii. we are a family of 5, from Australia, and we stayed in their 2 bedroom 2 bath suite.

The hotel was great, it was spotless, the staff were ultra friendly and very very helpful. The rooms are massive, they seemed to be cleaned every day. The breakfast selection was a bit limited and the choice didint change much or maybe its just me being picky and trying to find a fault. As the hotel is a drive away from any restaurants the staff will act as a free taxi, by dropping you out and picking you up. I would strongly recommend travelling to Manhatten Beach and visit the `Rock n Fish` restaurant, it was brilliant, i`ve had alot of food in alot of places, this place would rate as one of the best, great for the seafood lover.", "title": "Great", "user": "LPKent", "date": "October 31, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6032703}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "El Segundo"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 11, "very good": 60, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 123}, "aka": "Residence Inn Lax El Segundo Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.2}
