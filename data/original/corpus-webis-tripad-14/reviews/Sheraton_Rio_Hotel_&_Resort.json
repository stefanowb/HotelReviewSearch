We stayed in an Executive suite on the 10th floor that had stunning views of the ocean, Rio and the local Favela - one of the few times i did have to pinch myself when we got to the room because the view was so amazing. The best moments were watching the fire works on New Year's eve and then watching the sun rise the next morning when we got back from a new year's party. Leblon is a 10-15 minute walk down the hill (or a $R8 taxi ride back up) where some of Rio's best restaurants are located. Its very safe to walk into Leblon.

The hotel is very very tired and well overdue for a face lift. The Sheraton's website has obviously used photoshop on this hotel as the exterior of the building is crumbling. The rooms are adequate but nothing special. The gym equipment is old but functional. There are two pools but the temperature in one is like having a bath...not what you really want when its 33 degrees outside. The sea water is not the cleanest. On our first trip to Rio i got an ear infection - would seriously advise not to put your head under the water. Also there were days when rubbish and other crap would wash in. The most annoying thing however was the food quality and cost. It was incredibly expensive (now that's saying something given i live in london and eat out alot!) and very very average. I'm very happy to pay top pound (or even dollar) when the food is exceptional but i object to paying overly inflated prices for mediocre dishes, especially those that are not even executed correctly (i'm sure a Ceasar salad comes with a Ceasar dressing - not at the Sheraton!)

The locals will tell you this hotel is in Sao Conrado but in reality it\u00b4s in neither place. Standing on its own on a high piece of coast road beyond Leblon, the Sheraton is an ugly Stalinist building with a beautiful view and access to a small sandy beach. It is clean and shiny - a typical international business hotel, (although the business centre was shut on the day of a Brazilian public holiday when the rest of the business world was working.) On first impression, it is well staffed and welcoming but scratch the surface and you\u00b4ll find that while they\u00b4re efficient at opening doors and hailing cabs, the service is extremely hit and miss. One of the delightful pool attendants launched a massive search when we lost our sun lotion yet the front-desk staff had zero information about the Fifa World Beach Soccer Championships which were kicking off in Rio the following day. Being a 30-minute drive from Centro, we asked if the concierge could help us book tickets for the Teatro Municipal. He just gave us a phone number. We had to deliver our own laundry to the generally grumpy front desk because no one came to collect it, then they charged 50% extra because of the public holiday.
