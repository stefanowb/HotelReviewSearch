I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews; however we were pleasantly surprised to find a clean, pleasant room with a functional bathroom. We had room 11 (at the top of the house!) and although we faced the street, the room was quiet. The twin room was not large, but wasn't tiny either. As mentioned previously, the linen was not brand new, but was definitely clean and the towels are indeed changed daily. The bathroom was tiny, but had plenty of hot water except one morning towards the end of our stay when the hotel was full. Other than a shaving outlet, there are none in the bathroom. The outlets are in the little alcove where the small TV sits. It would be nice if they placed a mirror there so you can actually see yourself while blow-drying your hair. There is no elevator, and the stairs can be quite steep, but I'm not in the best shape, and was able to manage them (slowly). Getting luggage to the top rooms is a challenge, but doable. The location is very central; easy walk to the British Museum, Kings Cross/St. Pancras train station. There is even a stop for one of the London bus tours nearby. The breakfasts were good and plentiful with something for everyone. I felt the area is very safe - we didn't see anything or anyone to be concerned about - even New Years Eve. On the whole, I would recommend this hotel; while the Mentone is not the Ritz, it is most definitely not a dump.", "user": "yogadroid", "date": "December 16, 2006", "id": 6448075}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Mentone Hotel OK...", "text": "For the price, it's centrally located and the staff was pleasant but that is all I can say about it.

I would never go back - the walls are paper thin and the noise in the hotel is dreadful. Our first room stank of smoke and was a bed and a half rather than a double, so we asked to be moved. The second room was only slightly better - there was no hand towel in the bathroom and nowwhere to fix the shower handle to, so it meant bathing all the time or trying to hold the shower handle. The bed was terrible - I could feel the springs in the mattress and the pillows were lumpy. The breakfast wasn't great either, and on weekdays they only serve until 9, 9.30 at the weekends.

We had two rooms, just off the main stairwell, through a firedoor, and as they were the only two rooms there, it was like having a suite. In the daytime we could wedge the doors open (they faced each other) so we could keep an eye on the kids whilst still retaining some privacy of our own. In the night time we could lock their door and relax in the knowledge that they were only just across the small \"private\" hallway. The breakfasts have been written about before and we can confirm a 10/10 score here. One criticism, is that there was no place to leave your bags once you had checked out. Not really their problem I suppose, but most places have somewhere secure to leave your stuff if your flight is later on in the day. All in all, The Mentone is great for tube links, fairly central and the neighbourhood seemed really safe - the 24 hour Tesco is good as well.
