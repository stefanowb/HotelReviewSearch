If you decide to purchase at the small store at the resort you will end up paying triple the cost. For those of you that are wine lovers and like having a glass in your room, you are not able to through room service. They do not inlude bottles of wine through their all-inclusive package. I purchased wine at the grocery store and saved a lot of money! Also, the all inclusive package included their room service menu which can come in handy.

If you can get it as part of your package it's highly recommended since all the food and bevarages that are available on-site are very expensive. The only negative thing I can say about their all inclusive is that you have to sign your bill every single time you order something. So if you are ordering drinks and snacks while at the pool you are not able to run a tab and have to sign the bill each and every time. Which can be annoying. I do not understand why they do it this way, especially since we all had bracelets indicating that we were all inclusive guests! And only one slightly negative comment about the all inclusive is the lack of on-site dining options. They have one buffet restaurant and one a la carte restaurant. We are used to more choices at larger resorts. With that being said, the quality of the food at both the buffet and at the a la carte was very, very good and better than most resorts we have stayed at.

Also, it feels safe here with the extra security checks into the resort. There is no nightlife at the resort but that keeps it safe and quiet for those nights that you want to stay in. A couple of tips - to go downtown Puerto Vallarta, take the city buses there for about $2 versus $25 or so for a cab. Of course, take a cab back though if it's late at night. Bucerias is a sleeping little town but I actually found some nightlife there this time. Shamrocks and the Drunken Duck were both a lot of fun.

Some friends of ours just purchased a timehare at a different hotel down the beach, so we thought, why not? You get a free buffet breakfast with the timeshare person, $50 dollars (US), a bottle of champagne or tequilla, and a Gold Card, that allows you to get a discount at the deli (excellent sandwiches), and the two restaurants and Spa. The villa is so nice, it should sell itself, and it would, if the timeshare presentation was not so high pressure. We were told it was only a 90 minute presentation, but for us, we waisted 3 hours. \"You would buy into this, if you loved your wife.\" \"Think of your children, and their children (my son is only 14)' \"If you do not take this deal, then obviously, you do not like good vacations\". \"I can't guarantee the price, if you walk out that door. Price is only good now, won't be available later today.\" I would recommend that they avoid these types of presentation strategies. The program is good, but with that type of presentation, and the fact that we had three other people try to close the deal after our guide left us, was not very pleasant. I would avoid the sales pitch, unless you are ready to write the check right away.
