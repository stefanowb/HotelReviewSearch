We were immediately impressed upon check-in on how great the customer service is at this hotel. The staff greets you by name after the first interaction. The rooms are spacious and large. Our suite (upgraded as a Platinum member) was as large as a 1 bedroom city apartment with a walk-in closet and a separate living room. The complimentary arrival gift and buffet breakfast was also a treat. We will definitely stay at this Marriott the next time we are in Toronto.", "title": "Wow!
