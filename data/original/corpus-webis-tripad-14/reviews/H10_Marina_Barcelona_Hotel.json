However if you go there for turistic reasons consider that the area is quite far from the main attractions and that you necessarily need to take the metro to go to the city center (or walk 30-40 minutes to get to the \"Born\") , also in this area it is quite difficult to find a restaurant (outside the hotel one) to have dinner. So you would need to take the metro also to have a dinner in the city center. On the other hand this make it possible to have a quite good price/quality ratio in comparison to other solutions in Barcelona.

All staff courteous and helpful . Superb breakfast buffet including bucks fizz if you want it! Had balcony room at the front with panoramic views of city attractions, spectacular when lit up at night. Rooms were clean, comfortable and functional. Loved the quieter location near Blue Bus Route pick-up points, beach, restaurants, Casino and the Zoo at Ciutadella Park. Felt safe walking back at night. Taxis nearby, easy to hail, reasonable fares to city sights. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.

A great location for the beach and marina, taxis are easy to get, just flag one down for yourself instead of asking for help all the time, and so what if it costs ten euros to get into town!!
