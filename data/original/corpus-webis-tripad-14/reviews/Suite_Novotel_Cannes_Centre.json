Some excellent points and some not so good. The parking is reasonably priced (8 euros for 24 hours) and in an underground car park under the hotel (easy parking, but not an easy up/down ramp if you have a larger car). The rooms are inexpensive. We paid 90 euros.The staff are all friendly and very helpful. A couple of great details like free 15 minute chair massages in the reception area on Thursday evenings and, apparently, free use of a Smart car if you ask ahead (we didn't need this service) are also very nice. The bar area is pleasant and the whole hotel is clean. The room/suite was quite spacious and we liked the fact that the table was large and on wheels, so you could move it around according to your needs. Same with the TV. Also plenty of room to put a baby cot and to let children play on the floor if you're travelling with little ones. Mini fridge with two free bottles of water, and a few nice touches like tea, coffee and hot chocolate along with a microwave (microwave meals and yoghurts etc. for sale in the lobby) also nice. Toilet separate from bathroom, which makes life easier if you're sharing a room.

I've had this problem before with Accor chain hotels (Mercur, Ibis...) in the winter, when the AC is switched off and for some reason warm air is circulated through the whole hotel. This is fine when you're stepping out of the shower, but infernal at night, given that you can only open one window a crack. Temp hovered around 25 degrees C (77 F) we reckoned. Pillows not great, though beds were fine. Soap/shampoo in the shower was marked clearly with 'avoid contact with eyes' so you might want to give that a miss.The other thing is breakfast. Frankly, avoid it. 13 euros for a few small things that felt like afterthoughts (the only tea on the buffet was mint, the grapes were brown, there were no bowls whatsoever available to put one of the two cereals in, the plates were cardboard....) is a bit scandalous. Have had much better buffet breakfasts at Ibises and Mercures in general, so this was odd.

We're Australian and have the best beaches in the world so that part of the south of France didn't impress us. Plus it was just a big city that was quite over priced- expected, but at times unnecessary. In saying that, we still had a nice stay in Cannes & in the Suite Novotel. We found the staff very helpful and very good English (which is hard to find in France). Parking was 8\u20ac per day which is quite good considering how expensive everything else is and the maniac drivers. The rooms were very nice & spacious. Although beware, our room said queen plus single- the queen was great but if you do have a 3rd person, the single is a small day bed with no sheets. The room had a great bathroom, microwave, safe, bar fridge- pretty good if you're self catering like we were. I have read other reviews & a few mentioned the air con not working. We stayed in October & it wasn't hot, however we still found the rooms a little stuffy and the air con didn't help much so there could be some good truth to this. But if you're staying in the colder months- no worries. Also, we had breakfast included in the price, but if you have the choice to pay for it- you'll probably get better value going to the gorgeous patisserie just a few doors down (breakfast was nothing special).

The public areas are decorated in a pleasingly quirky mismatch of armchairs and cushions, while the bedrooms are of the usual high Novotel standard of convenience and cleanliness. Unlike the Marrakech Suite Novotel, this room was kept well supplied with soap, tea, coffee and biscuits. Breakfast is a little strange because in addition to the usual bread, croissants, butter and jam there are little refridgerated pots which appear to contain substances similar to laboratory specimens and described as 'healthy'.
