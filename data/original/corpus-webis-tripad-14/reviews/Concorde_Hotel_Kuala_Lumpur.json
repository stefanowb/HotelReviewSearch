It's a pretty old hotel that's still stuck in a recent past era and the rooms show it. Took a premiere room which was a really good size but fixtures all from late 80s early 90s. Nicely big though and great location BUT if you leave something bpehind like I did, in the shower room - brand new, fresh from duty free skII toiletries etc....you wont get the back. I called an hour later after checking in to another klhotel and only ot a response a day later, which later pingpong'd. 3 days later the exec chef says they're gone. Lots of back and forth till I realized it's a lost cause. ShAme on you Concorde. It's not like a csi investigation.
