I was surprised. The hotel room we had was slightly outdated, but our friends had a better room. The food to me was great, they cook fresh meat and fish in front of you as well as pasta. The breakfast was great with many options with freshly made omelets and creps. The 3 restaurants were great, mexican, italian and chinese. The staff were all so friendly and happy. The entertainment staff was one of the best I have seen. They provided great activities for everyone and all of them were very friendly, making our trip even better. I can't say one bad thing about any of the entertainment staff. We made great friends and want to return very soon! No regrets for choosing this hotel. Was better to be on the Sol Sirenas side because it was more family oriented. Many kids stay at the Sol Coral side on group trips, but we went during march break.

The food was ok to good. The fresh fish and chicken & turkey was the best bet. Good to check out the restaurants for some variety. The beds are hard. The lobby restrooms are clean but really in need of updating, some stalls had no seats, doors with no locks etc. The Michael Jackson Tribute was great, don't miss it! The beach was the best one I have ever been to. Lots of live music in the evening. We enjoyed the beach grill at lunch and most days there was live music there as well. You have to put a 15 pesos cash deposit for each towel at check in and return them between 9-5, then get a note saying you've returned the towels to get your deposit back. Exchanging towels sometimes a problem, they would run out. Might be easier to bring your own towel from home. Overall the staff were very nice and most helpful and the hotel is good value.
