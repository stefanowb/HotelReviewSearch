They made my stay very pleasant and comfortable which is what good hotels should be doing. The location was excellent as it was about 5 minutes from Tsim Sha Tsui station. However as it is along a busy street, it can be quite noisy. I booked a superior room but was given an upgrade as the hotel was crowded. The room was big and comfortable, there was ample space to move around. With free wifi, I was able to face time with my family anytime I want. Plus the wifi connection was good and had no disruption. If only the hotel had a 'no smoking' policy, the cigarette smell do linger in the lift and along corridor areas. A sign to remind customers to tone down is required at the lift area, it can be quite noisy which was what I experienced as my room was directly facing the lift. Overall, this is a good hotel which I would come back to as well as recommend to friends going to Hong Kong.", "title": "Friendly service and big room", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Goodtrip2012", "date": "April 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 128030116}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I only stayed one night at this hotel.
