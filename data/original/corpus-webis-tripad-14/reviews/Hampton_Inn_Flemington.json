What seemed to set it apart is the service., From the moment we walked in, we were special. The woman who checked me in called me a few moments later to ask if the room was satisfactory. Rob, her partner behind the desk, was evidently matching her act for act in the service derby. Finding that there was no tea with the coffeemaker (an unsettling occurrence which has happened often since the fall - the last two times in large hotels, one in which we were simply told there was no tea and the second in which we were exhorted to get it from room service, for about $10.00 of course - plus delivery charge, tax and gratuity) I went to the desk and asked if there were a couple of tea bags I could have. Rob asked what kind I wanted and, when he turned to get it, was approached by a group of women from one of the meeting rooms who were trying to tip him for being so helpful. He was trying to explain to them that he couldn't accept tips and in that second, the woman from the desk came back and asked what I needed. I told her that he was getting me some tea and was just briefly interrupted. She demanded to be the one to get me the tea, took me to the breakfast area and showed me where I could get all the tea, in all the flavors, I could possibly want. after grabbing a couple of bags and thanking her I turned to go but Rob, now free, asked where I'd gone. I told him the tea situation was taken care of by his cohort but he insisted on helping even more. \"I am going to set you up. I take care of my guests,\" he said. I told him that I had the two bags and that was fine, but he took me to the kitchen, where he had me pick out more teas. Needless to say I was in tea heaven. I haven,t had service like this since at a Fairmont hotel. In how many hotels do desk staff practically trip over each other trying to help you? I chatted with this pair later on and they are really two very nice, very helpful people who take pride in what they do. They made the stay, rather than simply very good, extraordinary. I realize this a long review but it seems that it illustrates how great the staff is better than I could do otherwise.
