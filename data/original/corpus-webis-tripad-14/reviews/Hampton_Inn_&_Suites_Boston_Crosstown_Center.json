From the price, I expected I'd be staying at a big-city hotel with muffins or donuts and coffee for breakfast and few amenities. Instead, I found an attractively modern, comfortable hotel, with courteous and prompt no-cost shuttle service to and from the hospital and airport, and a full, hot breakfast available, at no cost, in the morning. A couple of local restaurants delivered reasonably priced dinners that didn't taste like fast food. Staff were pleasant and helpful. A pool and exercise equipment were available (alas, I left my bathing suit at home), as were rental movies and wifi connection.

The shuttle even took us to the JFK Museaum one morning (also great). The front desk staff were very accomodating. The pool on the 9th floor was very nice. Given the price of Boston's hotels, this one is a good value.

I would have given it a 5 rating except for the fact of its location. It is in a bad area of town and unless you have transportation accessibility, it's not a safe area. As for the hotel, it is a very clean, well-maintained facility with friendly and helpful staff. The buffet breakfast was a plus and the manager of the hotel mingled with the guests during breakfast, which I thought was good public relations. There is a Boston tour that comes to the hotel and picks you up. That was a real convenience. The hotel also provides a free shuttle to and from the airport. We did wait for the shuttle almost an hour, but that's to be expected in Boston. Another guest staying at the hotel told me that the shuttle never came, maybe because they didn't realize that it could be a long wait, so they took a cab to the hotel and the hotel was gracious enough to pay the cab fare. There is also a hotel shuttle that takes you to a few local destinations. I didn't take advantage of the service, but one person I spoke to said the service was very helpful. The hotel recommends that you do not depend on the shuttle for your total transportation. We were in town for a convention so it had it's own shuttle to and from the convention.

You have a great breakfast in the morning with sausage, fruit, french toast sticks, eggs, muffins, bagels, and cereals. My advice is just to weigh the choices.
