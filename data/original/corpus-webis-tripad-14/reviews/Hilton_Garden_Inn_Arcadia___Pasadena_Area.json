(When I stayed in the Embassy Suites, my room had a thermostat, but I eventually learned from the front desk that it did not work at all, and could only be used to make the room colder regardless of how you set the thermostat.

It is practically brand new. Everything is clean and well-tended to. While they do not offer a continental breakfast they have a deli where you can get whatever you need provided you don't mind paying an arm and a leg for it. There are restaurants nearby including a Denny's where you can get a nice breakfast. The room is decent-sized, comfortable, and has a refrigerator. The biggest difficulty I had was finding the hotel. The street where it is located is off Huntington Drive, a very windy road and it is easy to get confused. I had difficulty getting directions from the front desk agent when I was lost. Bottom line, if you are going there, get detailed directions from someone physically at the hotel. Get landmarks. Arcadia is a cute little town.
