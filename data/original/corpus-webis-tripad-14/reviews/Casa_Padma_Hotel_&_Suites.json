Double glaze the windows and problem would reduce, doors at end of corridors would also keep some noise out, although cost probably prohibits that. Room condition was average, but we had a superior suite and size was ok for 10 day stay. As with most things in Bali anything over 5years old is likely to look a little tired. Our hot water was hit and miss, the towels grey but clean. Bed was ok but pillows need replacing. The staff lovely and friendly. The pool needs heating as was very cold as shaded most of the day but if you need a refresh wake up then it's the pool for you. Totally recommend the banana pancakes or nasi goreng for breakfast, last visit to Bali we visited drops on 3 occasions but didn't get a chance this time. Wayan and friends across road very very good food which I would totally recommend as alternative if the menu at drops doesnt entice. Quite a resonable place to stay, but, that pub across the road really is loud and for 4 days straight frequented by 3 loudmouth drunk Aussies, one a female who you would swear was a stripper.. I was totally embarrassed to be Aussie those days.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Tracy L", "date": "September 7, 2012", "id": 139699088}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "Wouldn't stay again unfortunately and that's only because of the pub.", "title": "In one word; Perfect", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Dean M", "date": "August 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 138733929}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "We stayed at Casa Padma Suites in February last year.", "title": "wouldnt come back", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "netty58", "date": "August 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 138266619}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The outlay is awesome! the pools are clean and have swim-up bars.

Most of what the other reviews say is true, but no place is perfect. The pub across the road is loud but the music only goes until about 10.30pm. There are good options for breakfast and the food is nice. The pool tiles are an odd green color but the pool is very clean and big, there are not a lot of lounges around the pool but there never seemed to be many people on them anyway. The bathrooms are nice and there isnt much pressure to the shower but i have found that alot in hotels in Bali. We had booked a superior suite which had all the amenities it states on the Internet but it did not look like the pictures. I think there are 2 suites on the corner that are a little different, room #106 & #107, and we just happened to stay in both of them. We left Kuta for a few days and then came back to the Casa.
