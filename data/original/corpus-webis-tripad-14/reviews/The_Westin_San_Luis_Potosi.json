This was my first trip to Mexico so I was not sure exactly what to expect. But the Westin was certainly pleasant. The hotel/resort itself is gorgeous. Beautiful artwork, excellent deatail with an authentic Mexican feel. My room was very nice and quite comfortable. The bed was AMAZING. The most comfortable hotel bed I have ever been in. I think they call it the heavenly bed-it certainly deserves that name. I had a cute little balconly that you could stand out on. There was a small table near the balcony window which served perfect for solo room service meals. I LOVED the bathroom. Gorgeous marble flooor with a oversized marble bath. I took baths everynight because it was so relaxing. Even the artwork and detail in the bathroom was beautiful. My room very clean. the maids did an amazing job. My floor was vacuumed everday. Be aware that if you are in your room and you want privacy, put the lock on-the maids will come in at various times to leave candy, clean, or leave a note for free drinks at the bar (which is nice). I learned quickly that if I didnt want to be bothered then I needed to lock the door. The gym was very roomy and easily accessible. I ate at the restuarant almost every night. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The dining room itslef was gorgeous and if you came at the right time, there was someone playing the piano and/or singing- very relaxing. Wireless internet was not free :(. Huge drawback for me and I'm sure for all the other business travellers, but I was able to access intnet in the business lounge when no one was in there. The pool was beautiful and centrally located. In the afternoon the sun beats right down on it. But the \"heated\" pool was freezing. Keep in mind that this on of the nicest areas for weddings, parties, get togethers in the state. So be prepared for all of that on the weekends. I think that they're a few girls' birthday celebrations happending in the courtyards on Saturday which was nice, but that night there was a wedding reception---boy do Mexicans know how to party. It was beautiful, but loud-until about 3am. The hotel forwarned us and offered ear plugs that day-I thought it was a joke at first, but they were serious. It was loud, but it was the weekend so I wasn't mad about it. Overall the service was great--the staff will do anything for you and do it with a smile whether they understand you or not :).
