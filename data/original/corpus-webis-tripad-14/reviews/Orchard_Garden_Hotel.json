The sheets and comforters made it feel like we were curling up in a cloud every night, which was very nice after long days of meetings and/or sightseeing. The room looked out onto the street with a great view but was still very quiet, and we never heard people in the neighboring rooms, so sleeping was easy. The hotel is \"green\" and has wonderful environmentally-themed decor and stylish recycling receptacles in the room, which we greatly appreciated. The flat-screen TV was awesome, as was the DVD player in the room and free DVDs available at the front desk - we recommend \"Escape from Alcatraz.\" Front-desk staff was friendly, and the hotel was very willing to accomodate several of our special requests.
