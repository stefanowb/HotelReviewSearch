A very nice set up downtown close to the sky tower and really good restaurants. It was a large sleeping room, clean, new bedding and furniture. And curtains that stayed shut and kept it dark. With a separate small kitchenette (sink, microwave, burners, coffee pot etc...) and tv area. Very close to some student housing but no noise problems. We thought we got an awesome deal for the dollar...about 100 american dollars a night for the three of us, with two queen sized beds. The only problem is that July is winter in New Zealand and they have a small plug in thermal heater that was a joke, on high it kept the room at about 58 degrees, but we weren't in much.
