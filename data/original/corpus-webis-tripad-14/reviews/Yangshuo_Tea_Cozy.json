Huge crowds sign up for early morning bike tours and clog the roads. We avoided that. The location is near Li River raft wharf, also crowded at times. Opt for the longer raft ride (more scenic) where you can be dropped off and picked up downstream,rather than the one that just goes back and forth a short distance. We did that, rather than the half-day cruise from Guilin. A two-night stay was perfect. We saw the extravagant 900-person water show one evening. Be prepared for crowds--3000 per show and 3 shows.
