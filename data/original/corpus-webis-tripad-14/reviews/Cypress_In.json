This hotel is more of a hostel but charges rates like a hotel. The rooms we had were on the third floor and the stairs were small and hard to navigate with our luggage. The rooms were basic and bare with no views out the window and A/C only worked in one room that we had. The rooms had 2 twin beds and space for our luggage and that was about it. The 2 showers and bathroom were shared (not adjoining the room) by everyone on the floor. The hotel is in a great location for nightlife, restaurants and especially shopping BUT it is right next to a club which BLASTS music until 6am. So members of our party couldn't sleep. I would not stay here again and was happy I only had to stay for one night.", "title": "More of Hostel than hotel near Palermo Soho", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "lolomojo", "date": "January 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6575238, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location was convenient", "disliked": "\u2014 Loud clubs played music all night, A/C only worked in 1 room, Shared bathroom"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007", "text": "I agree with the other reviews.
