The new facilities are beautifully appointed, with stylish furnishings and stunning views across the valley. It is situated in the heart of the region making it a great launch-pad for visits to the various estates and being a 5 minute taxi ride from Regua made it quite accessible. Helpful staff and a beautiful buffet breakfast made for a very pleasant experience overall. Could have been even better with the offer of food/ room service throughout the day.", "user": "DTLC78", "date": "April 29, 2012", "id": 129042796}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "A perfect retreat in the Duoro Valley", "text": "We stayed in the just newly finished hotel and would highly recommend it. Our room had a beautiful view overlooking the vineyards and a patio with comfortable chairs to enjoy the view with a glass of wine. The rooms have every modern luxury and spacious enough to feel more than comfortable. The new addition has great attention to detail with plenty of sitting rooms inside and outside to truly appreciate the property. The breakfast was a delicious feast of pastries with fresh jams, meat and cheese, homemade yogurt, fresh juice with oranges from the trees on the property and other fresh fruit. The wine tour and tasting was enjoyable and we discovered a new liking for Port! With GPS we had no problem finding the house and immediately spotted the orange houses built into the hill. A fantastic stay to recharge in the Duoro Valley at a beautiful hotel with attentive hosts.", "user": "ZZinger", "date": "March 22, 2012", "id": 126516784}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful Wine Estate Experience", "text": "We stayed two nights at this quinta. Like other reviewers, we had a little trouble finding it. The house and setting among the vineyards is absolutely lovely and the Douro Valley as a whole is stunning. Much more beautiful than Tuscany and Napa. We stayed in the green room, which was spacious and very comfortable with a comfortable bed and modern bath. The breakfast was good. Antonio provided very good service and answered our many questions about the quinta and area. Sonia gave us an excellent wine tour, which is complimentary with the stay. We enjoyed the wines immensely and bought several items to take home. We also did the hike up to the top of the vineyards behind the quinta. It was lovely and we had a great view of the Douro river and surrounding area. There are stone tables for picnics. Sonia gave us a great recommendation for dinner - Castas e Pratos - a restaurant and wine bar in town. We had excellent tapas and wine in the wine bar. The service was lacking a bit, but the food made up for it. We also did the scenic drive to Porto. A bit long, but lovely at many points along the way. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the quinta and touring the Douro Valley.", "user": "atdrg", "date": "December 3, 2011", "id": 121363239}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "We will be back", "text": "It also took us a little while to find it - The directions posted on their website are good - we were working with a GPS also, and I got confused when combining the two.", "user": "cwitkows", "date": "October 12, 2011", "id": 119240802}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "...

Only few rooms (6) at the Quinta so it is very exclusive, although they are under construction to have 8 more rooms soon. Breakfast was nice, fresh, country style.
