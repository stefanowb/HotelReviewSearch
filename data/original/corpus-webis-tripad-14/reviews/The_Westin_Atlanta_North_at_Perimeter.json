Downhill from the sliding of my room key. A very stale odor greeted our nostrils as we opedned the door, as if the room had been locked away from the public for a few years. The large television was excellent as we started through the room, so with my manly short term memory the journey continued with renewed hope. Cords, tangled and chaotic, dangling behind a cup ring stained desk was next to catch my eye. Beside it was a slumping, sloppy chas lounge around 5 years past its prime. My optomism began to deminish. I had to continuously bump down the thermostat until I reached a 60 degree stop (as low as it would go) that barely kept the sweat at bay. Later that night after my shower to freshen up I noticed the body towels ranging the color spectrum from off white to a slight grey also varied in size and shape. It was strange, and I've never seen this before at any other hotel. I then noticed the shower and bathroom tile could definitely use some Scrubbing Bubbles and a little (or maybe alot) of elbow grease. I left the bathroom and walked around the room in my fresh out of the suitcase socks for 10-15 minutes getting ready for bed. As I laid down my wife made a ghastly discovery!! My fresh socks had changed from a good clean white color to a very dark greyish color. Disgusting!!! Overall, the cleanliness was 1 star maybe 2 masked by 5 stars worth of friendlyness.

And the head of the bed seemed higher than the foot of the bed, so I was sleeping on a reverse incline (warning to those with acid reflux!). The chaise lounge looked (as my fiance put it) like a prop from a porn flick. It was dirty, stained and sagging. I didn't even want to put my luggage on it, let alone my body. I understand hotels charging for internet in the room (though I think $12.95 is a bit ridiculous) but offering NO free access in the lobby?! What part of the game is that?!
