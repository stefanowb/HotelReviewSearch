Although previous reviewers complained about the noise level in this room, we did not have this experience. Our stay at the Nice Garden Hotel was comfortable, convenient, and pleasant. Marion and her staff are most friendly and helpful. The room was very quiet at night. Of course, once breakfast service starts, one can hear some activity, but my wife and I were always up by 8AM anyway. Yes, the shower and bathroom are small, but this is a 2 star hotel. The breakfast in the garden is a most enjoyable experience. Given the price, location, friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, I think this is an outstanding value. I definitely would stay here again.", "title": "Excellent Experience !", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "HansJuergen", "date": "October 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10031272}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Lovely place, very friendly, I felt very well looked after!

(Ironically I think it was Marion or her staff walking up and down providing their friendly service which was one of the main causes!). I also agree that the bathroom was very small and each night I had to move the bed away from the wall. However, on the plus side, the welcome and service was great, the location is fantastic and remembering that you're in a 2 star hotel it was good value for money. Would I stay there again? Perhaps for a city break when you're on a budget and want to be up and about early every morning.
