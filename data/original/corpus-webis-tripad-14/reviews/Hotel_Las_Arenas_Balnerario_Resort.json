We chose the hotel for its location and we weren't disappointed. Across a pedestrian walkway is the beautiful sandy beach - although we found it hard to leave the hotel. We booked a junior suite so the 3 of us could share and although we had a side view, this wasn't a big problem as we didn't spend much time in the room. We were shown a sea view room and we decided it wasn't worth the extra cost. The hotel is big (253 rooms?) and hosts its fair share of corporate events and weddings. However, we never felt that such events dominated the hotel and we could always find space by the pool. The room was very comfortable and clean, with a good bathroom. My wife and daughter both enjoyed treatments at the spa. There is a kids' pool quite separate from the adults' pool where we spent most of the time reading and swimming in the enormous pool. Sadly the diving boards are no longer in use. The pool attendant was very efficient moving beds, bringing towels and setting up an umbrella. It did get quite windy by the pool, but this was very pleasant since the temperature rose beyond 30 degrees. Breakfast in the hotel wasn't cheap at 23 euros per person, but the buffet was very generous. For lunch, we went down to the variety of beachside restaurants to the right of the hotel and enjoyed delicious seafood and paella. As a base for visiting Valencia, it's not ideal as the journey in takes about 20-30 minutes. However it's well worth it as Valencia is charming with some good restaurants and shops, not to mention the ultra modern Palace of Arts and Sciences. We'd definitely go back to this hotel and the city, which is like a smaller, calmer version of Barcelona.", "title": "Stylish resort hotel on the beach", "user": "Donk-Argyle", "date": "June 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164803773}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were in the hotel for one week.

Good but not great rooms (take the one with sea views because facing the other side would have been terrible), very nice breakfasts and good spa. The hotel area is far from city center and next to a large port; so, the neighborhood is rather scary and not too suitable for walks around, unless to the sea. Two options: either take a taxi to the city (15-20 minute drive to city center) or just hang out at the beach or in the hotel. There are several good bars and restaurants lining up at the seafront. Also, there is some fun activity at the beach in the evenings, with a fun local band and local capoeira amateurs. Beware of some noise (rooms are not fully soundproof and in the evenings it may get noisy at the beach or from the parties in the hotel restaurant), but nothing critical.

Overall I would recommend and I will return but some helpful tips are make sure you eat in one of the many restaurants all lined up alongside it instead of the hotel because not only are they a helluva lot cheaper, but food is far tastier and they all have bucket loads more atmosphere than the hotel.
