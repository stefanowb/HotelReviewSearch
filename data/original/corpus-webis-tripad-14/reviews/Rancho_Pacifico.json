We flew into San Jose on December 1st and stayed overnight at the Hampton Inn at the airport (which I have also reviewd on tripadvisor). The next morning we took a taxi to Tobias Bola\u00f1os International Airport for our Nature Air flight. Note that this airport is about 10 miles away from the Juan Santamaria International Airport, which is a 30 minute to 1 hour trip (depending on traffic) from Juan Santamaria, as compared to Sansa Air which flies out of Juan Santamaria Airport. While Nature Air plans to move its operations to Juan Santamaria Airport in the future, until that happens you may want to consider taking Sansa Air instead to avoid the additional travel (and taxi cost). There was a huge traffic jam en route to Tobia Bolanos Airport, but we arrived 45 minutes later thanks to some taxi driver heroics and were able to board our plane on time. Once we arrived at the airport in Quepos, we had to wait about 15 minutes for the driver from RP who was a bit late. He apologized for the delay and was very nice. The ride from Quepos to RP is about 1 hour, most of it on good paved roads. The unpaved road up to the lodge is very bumpy and you will probably not want to drive it more than once or twice a day. It's walkable but difficult because it is very steep and unstable with loose gravel and rocks (although we regularly saw Garrison the owner and Tito the min pin making daily walks on the road). The driver offered to stop at the supermarket on the way to the lodge and we stopped and bought some fruit and trail mix and beer. Particularly if you plan on sticking around the lodge for most meals, we recommend stocking up on beverages and snacks-", "user": "Barbara L", "date": "December 21, 2011", "id": 121953141}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Once we arrived we were greeted by glasses of fresh tropical juice. We stayed in a second floor luxury spa suite which was a good size, and had a coffee maker, small fridge (which we had a little trouble with - it stopped working a few times but was fixed by the staff) with two refillable bottles of purified water, an armoire, and a sitting area with a small futon-like sofa, two leather armchairs and two coffee tables. Note that unlike the first floor spa room, the second floor does not have an additional outdoor space other than the balcony (the first floor appears to have a patio). Two pairs of shades in the particular room we stayed in were decorative only - they did not extend fully down to cover the window, which meant no privacy from the villa next to us, which had a view through our room and into our balcony (and the soaking tub). The balcony had two small chairs and a soaking tub with some tealights. There were two suites in the building we stayed in, and it was possible to hear the occupants in the suite dowstairs (and I'm sure they could hear us upstairs).

While RP draws mostly honeymooners and couples on their anniversary it seems, I enjoyed a mother-daughter trip and felt very welcome. The beauty of the place can hardly be put into words. The location is stunning and private. You really have to experience it - falling asleep to rain, waking to the distant sounds of monkeys, discovering the flora and fauna, seeing the clouds roll in and engulfing you and the mountains, watching the toucans in flight, exploring the rainforest and walking to the waterfall, indulging in the outdoor spa. The accomodations are lovely - fresh coffee, nice bedding, and a lovely bathroom with a shower that opens to the rainforest. Most of all, it was the staff that won my heart! A few tips: first, the road leading up to RP is steep, curvy, and requires an off-road vehicle. We were so thankful we chose RP for transportation rather than renting a car. Also, we visited in early November. Rain came every day, sometimes all day, but that was part of the wonderful experience! When you read \"rainy season\" trust that there will be rain.
