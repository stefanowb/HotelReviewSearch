Loved the location on Canal St bt West Broadway and Wooster. Room was clean with big windows and light color interior. Seemed much more minimal in design compared to other Sheratons. Nice big shower. Club Lounge was open on the weekend and breakfast was served until 11am which is nice on a weekend. While I liked the location one must realize it is on the Tribeca/Soho line... I found it very close to Soho, Tribeca, West Village, NoLita and Chinatown.", "title": "Great Sheraton", "user": "nychellzkitchen", "date": "January 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 123203224}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012", "text": "Valet Parking is $55...", "title": "Great location, very clean", "user": "Rayrachz", "date": "January 16, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 123179900}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled with family", "text": "I loved the location!!!

This hotel has a great location and helpful reception staff. We got a good deal on booking.com. Rooms were pretty spacious compared to other hotels in Manhattan. Negatives: hidden charges were a nasty surprise at check out, and the cleaning staff were rather aggressive asking for tips. Parking is a ripoff - we did it one night and then managed to find free parking in Manhattan!

However this did not live up to Sheraton expectations. When I checked in the room I requested was not available so I was moved to a room for the physically challenged which had no bath. Whilst it is claimed this is right in trendy Tribeca, it is not in the nice part of Tribeca, the hotel is right on canal street and right in the middle of the area where people hustling and harrassing you trying to sell you fake louis vuittons from garbage bags. Also full of tacky souvenier and electronic shops, whilst I felt safe I would not stay here with children. The concierge was helpful however now on reflection and after reading some reviews post event, I think the concierge actually over charges, eg my ticket to warhorse $139 + the same again as a 'brokers fee'. If you are travelling at a quiet time of day take the subway or a normal NYC cab to the airport the hotel cab is a rip off at + $100. Internet charge was $9.95 per day, yet when I checked out I had been charged multiple times multiple days. No mini bar and room service till only 11pm, I expected more from a sheraton.
