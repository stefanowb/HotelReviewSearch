The Movenpick is an exception. The staff and service we received were excellent. Pinar greeted us with a warm welcome and checked us into our room. She was also helpful in setting up a doctors appointment. Arda took us to our room and pointed out everything we might need (time for breakfast, gym, items and services available) . The restaurant manager, Sayit Sahin, did an excellent job ensuring we were well taken care of. My wife stated that this hotel really offers the service its star rating states and I can now see the difference.
