When we arrived on a Thursday evening for a 3 night stay, we were informed that the hotel was sold out and they had given away the suite we had reserved.

The TV remote didn't work and the room was small, with a queen bed and tiny closet. The service problems continued the next day when there was no maid service and they hadn't done anything about the TV remote. There was no hot water for showers on Saturday morning, but by the time we got back to the room Saturday night, the TV remote was repaired, the maid service performe, and the hot water was plentiful. There was no soap in the bathoom, and it took 20 minutes to get some delivered. At no time did management make any effort to apologize for the series of service foul-ups.

We read reviews here and asked not to be put in a room with a view of the highway on-ramp. Guess what we got.

We were blandly informed that the happy hour had just ended -- They never told us about it, even though it was going on a few feet away from us when we were at the front desk. We did get free breakfast with our stay -- Only it seemed mainly designed to keep people from stealing. When you check in, you get a sheet to fill out with what you want for breakfast. The only problem was that no one ever explained this to us, so when we went to breakfast, we were told to go back to our room and get our sheets. Very accommodating! Almost like prison or a high school cafeteria. Also, the wireless Internet requires a password that is in the \"handout\" you get when you check in.
