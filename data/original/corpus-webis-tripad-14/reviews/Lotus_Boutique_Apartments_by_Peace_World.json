Danielle has done a marvelous job remodeling these 5 apartments and they feel modern and clean. They are built in a very open style, featuring little half-walls separating the various areas. All of the windows have glass shutters which can be opened to let in the frequent breezes. There is an outdoor spa pool for each apartment and the rooms are light and airy. The value was outstanding, and I plan to return next year if I can!
