The beaches were tiny and (I would guess) man made. The pools were very ropey and the food was absolutely awful! we booked a sea front room but had read previous reviews so werent expecting anything spectacular. However the only view from our balcony was a mass of palm trees and a tiny bit of sky. Pretty enough but certainly not a sea view and I resent paying extra for something we didnt get. In the end we changed rooms after the first night anyway as we were in the block closest to the bar and live music disturbed us and our 5 year old until 11pm the first night. Not late for some Im sure but when we knew our daughter would wake up in the early hours due to jet lag we desperately wanted our sleep. There is live muisc in, or outside, the bar every evening until 11 so if you like early nights or at the least peace and quiet to listen to the sounds of nature around you, this is not the hotel for you.", "title": "mediocre", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "minihally", "date": "March 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 26429173}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006, traveled with family", "text": "The Palms resturant was tatty and terribly understaffed.

For lunch they had a buffet that was different each day, but you can also order off the a la cart menu. Dinner was good in both restaurants as well as the cocktails.
