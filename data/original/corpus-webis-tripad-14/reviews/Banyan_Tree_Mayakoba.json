We could not have been more in awe. My husband and I are big golfers and we brought our clubs to golf at Mayakoba. They never saw the light of day. We fell so in love with our villa that we never wanted to leave. Other than breakfast and dinner, we were in our villa ALL day. We stayed in a spa villa and I cannot even begin to describe how amazing it was. The pool was huge and the jacuzzi was great and used every night.", "title": "It does NOT get any better than this.

It just creates an unforgettable dining experience. We couldn't get enough of the food from Tamarind, the hotel's other main restaurant. Our first night there, we had the pleasure of meeting Christian Roth, the Food and Beverage director of Tamarind and the hotel bar, La Copa. He set up a special tasting menu for us with fantastic wines from Mexico. We rated it as one of the top meals we have ever had (almost better than Laserre in Paris!). We loved it so much that we even had dinner at Tamarind a second night with Christian. We had friends in town so he set up a beautiful dinner for us in their private banquet room called La Cava (where they served the president of Mexico when he attended the opening of the hotel) which is room where they also store their wines.
