From check-in to check-out we had nothing but good service. The girls at the front desk were helpful - giving directions, recommending shopping malls to try, the room was spacious and comfortable. Passing houskeepers in the hall we always got a smile and a hello. Our first day there we made a trip to the casino via the on call, 24 hour shuttle.
