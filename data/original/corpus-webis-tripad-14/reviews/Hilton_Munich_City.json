We spent almost 2 times the price on this hotel because it was a German holiday/October fest weekend. For the price it was totally NOT WORTH it! With any Hilton brand, one thing that defines them above every other hotel is their attention to details and this is what we expect! The hotel room's wall paper was peeling off; there was spider web on the ceiling/walls. The coffee/tea container was dirty and had someone's hair clip left in it. Worst thing was when we took a shower, the smell of rotten, moldy water with the combination of steam made the bathroom smell horrible.

Wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't of just made it to bed 2 hrs before! Good luck trying to print a boarding pass, went to the executive lounge and had to wait 30 mins for people in line for the 1 computer. The lounge attendant said she couldn't do it from her computer.
