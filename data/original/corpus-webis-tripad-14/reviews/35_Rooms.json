I went with my wife for my birthday recently. Having read the reviews on tripadvisor we chose this hotel. We were pleased and impressed by 35 Rooms from the outset. I emailed to ensure we would have a double room, not a twin, and because I mentioned it was my birthday they upgraded us to an executive room. That was followed up with a lovely basket of fruit when we checked in. The staff are really friendly and very helpful. All in all, we really got the impression that these guys cared about making us feel welcome, and they cared about what we thought of the hotel. Which is good, because I feel compelled to give them an excellent write up on here. They had good recommendations of where to go for meals and drinks, and because I couldn't get my phone to work, they helped us make reservations. The decor is sleek, modern and quirky in a good way but not flashy. The breakfast buffet is really good too. A couple of other nice touches - later check-out is standard (12pm-1pm) and the wifi, I think, is free (though we didn't use it).
