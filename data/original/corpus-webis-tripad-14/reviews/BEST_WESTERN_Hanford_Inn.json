We have stayed twice in the past year. The first time a noisy group of children's sports team members was there and there was a bit of noise. This last stay we all noticed the noise from the nearby freeway. So, paradoxically, the motel's easy access from State Route 198 also makes for its worst aspect, noise that includes a loudspeaker system used at a nearby car dealership. However, the price is right, and it is convenient to relatives we were visiting on both occasions.", "title": "Hanford lodgings", "user": "Grampy_Bob", "date": "November 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 183333381}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The staff (Sonia) I met was extremely helpful in making sure that my needs and satisfaction were met during my stay.
