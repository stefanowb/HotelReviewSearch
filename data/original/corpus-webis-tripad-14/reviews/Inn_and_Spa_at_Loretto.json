Otherwise shopping, great restaurants, the museums are all within an easy, easy walk. Lorretto Chapel is literally next door. The downtown area is clean and safe so walking is the thing to do. The hotel lounge and bar area is very nice. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant so can't comment on that. The entire staff was friendly, professional and responsive and I have very high expectations in this area so I was very pleased with all of them from valet, to front desk. The hotel is very charming and appealing. Some have mentioned the rooms are dark. This was true for us as well but did not bother us as we weren't there much. We did like the decor. The room was very quiet we were in Room 210. There is a frig in the room so you can store your own stuff without paying the high price of hotel refreshments. My wife loved the Spa. The Cons: Most of the rooms seemed to have balconies but they are not very private with just waist high railing dividing them. That was especially true for us as our balcony was shared with the room next door (no railing) AND the table and chairs were directly in front of our sliding glass door as we had the view, not a good one but a little. This had an embarassing moment as our AC stopped working. I opened the sliding glass door and was cooling off in my boxers after a hot day horseback riding when the lady next door came and sat in the chair 2 feet away from me. Don't get Room 210 if the shared balcony would be a problem for you. The closet was in the bathroom and a bit small.The elevator was S-L-O-W so we used the steps unless moving luggage.
