We arrived late and they did not have a king size bed strip side for us, which is what I requested. Based on other reviews, I did not take a pool side room (based on construction noise), so we took 2 queens on strip side, 16th floor. They said they would hold a King size strip side room for us if we wanted to move the following day. Their key machines were broken, so we had to wait for security to let us into our room and come back later for keys. The room was clean and the view was nice, but we did decide to take them up on the king size since we were staying 4 more nights. After multiple attempts to see if the new room was ready, we finally moved into our new room at about 5:00 PM the next day. Now we had a room on the 31st floor! View was even better, room seemed a little cleaner, and we had more space without the extra bed. We definitely did here horns and beeping from the construction starting at least by 6:00 AM in the mornings - even being high up, strip side. I don't think there are any rooms that wouldn't hear it.

I tried for an upgrade but as we arrived mothers day the hotel was completely booked out. The room we had was a good size with a king size bed very comfy. The rooms are very dated really needs a refurbishment reminded me of the 70's. Pool area was huge but they pack you in like sardines very hard to find a seat and if you get one its not near one of the pools but further away and still no room to move. The cocktail service in the casino is very slow but on the positive you dont have to pay for a drink whilst playing the slots or tables. We had rude service in the Chinese restaurant when we asked to put tab on room. But forgetting all of this we had a great trip there.

We are a family of 4 with 2 sons (ages 21 & 25). When we arrived, the check in counter was a bit crowded, however the line went rather quickly. I requested that we not be placed near any bachelor or bachelorette parties, away from the elevator and no adjoining room door (to cut down on the noise). My requests were granted along with the refrigerator I requested, at no extra cost. The resort fee was changed to $15.00 from $20.00 since we booked before the price increase became official. The hotel is very clean and well decorated throughout. Yes, the rooms are a bit dated, but not worn or dirty. The room has a safe, room control AC, flat screen TV, comfortable bed and pillows, blow dryer in the closet, etc. - your typical hotel room. No problem with water pressure and bathroom was well equipped and maintained. The remote control did not work in my sons' room, service came up quickly and repaired that. The 1st refrigerator in my room was inoperable, but service replaced that one rather quickly. Maid service arrives between 8:00-10:00 a.m. which was perfect for us because we were out of our room by 7:00 a.m. daily. We used the gym daily at 6:30 a.m. which was well equipped with cardio machines and free weights, towels, water and cleaning wipes to wipe down your machine. The gym is located on the 2nd floor in the spa, however, the spa is not included in the resort fee (i.e., sauna & whirlpool use), however you can purchase an all day pass for $10.00. The hotel is a better fit for adults, only. Although, I do not believe Las Vegas is a place for children to begin with the reason I waited until my youngest was 21 years old to visit. The pool area was clean and well serviced. The pool does rent a float for $10.00/day, but you can purchase a ring at the CVS and bring with you. Do not bring any food or drink (including bottled water) to the pool. You may only consume their products. I've read a few reviews about the volume level of the music at the pool. Yes it was loud, but not so loud that I could not converse with my party.

We all enjoyed the buffet, including my sons. I tried the cupcakery and the yogurt place, both were average in taste and quality. We took the free tram north to the Bellagio then picked up the bus to go north on the strip to the Stratosphere. I dont care to gamble, but figured I would spend $20.00 and I won $170.00 at the roulette table at the Stratosphere! I cashed in my chips and left. My husband and son did the sky jump at the Stratosphere, expensive, but they enjoyed it. The skyjump is the highest free fall ride in the world - so we were told. Dont go to the observation level, you get a better view from the sky jump area and its free. They charge you to gain access to the observation level at the Stratosphere, but you can go up to the restaurant during happy hour (4 - 7 p.m.) w/out a cover charge, but there is a 2 drink minimum. We saw a great comedy show at the Laugh Factory in the Tropicanca and the Ultimate Vegas Variety Show (this was a recommendation by the concierge desk at the Monte Carlo) in the mall in Planet Hollywood. Both were excellent and I highly recommend them. The price was reasonable for both. We were not able to fit in a Grand Canyon or Hoover Dam trip, but I am sure we will return and will fulfill both of those \"must do\" activities. We visited the M&M store across the street. The M&Ms are found on the 2nd floor and priced by the pound, not exactly cheap, but the visit was entertaining especially when creating my own bag of M&Ms from the several varieties offered. On the 3rd floor, you can create your own personalized M&Ms. The people that stand on the streets and hand out cards were not overly aggressive or disrespectful. Do not make eye contact, keep your hands at your side and continue walking, if you want to avoid taking a card. In fact, they were far more focused on handing the cards to men, which was a plus for me! There is a roller coaster in NYNY and a Ben & Jerry's! Try not to get fooled into walking too much on the strip. We are city people and are stubborn about walking and paid the price. Just because you can see it does not mean its w/in a reasonable distance, LOL. There are areas on the strip, especially near the City Centre, where you can only cross the strip by way of pedestrian bridges the path to which may take you up and down a few escalators and stairs BEFORE you reach the pedestrian bridge only to meet a new set of the same. We had another adventure when we were headed home from the Stratosphere, however, instead of looking both ways for a bus stop, we immediately walked south on the strip instead w/out bothering to look north for a south side stop. We had to walk a few blocks before we hit one (mind you a block in Vegas or any other city is far longer than a neighborhood block). Despite eating at the buffet 3 times/day, with all the walking, we didnt gain a pound!", "title": "Read some reviews so you know what to expect.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "islegal13", "date": "June 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 131072447}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The all day bus pass is $7.50.

The location was close to the centre and it if you prefer to taxi to one of the further ends of the strip and walk it is a fairly cheap ride (ask to go the back way and NOT down the strip). As other reviews have mentioned the hotel is showing its age but the room was nice and was clean and the bed was excellent so as far as I am concerned all was good!! I am a little paranoid about dirty hotel rooms and after reading LOTS of reviews of other Vegas hotels I felt hesitant about this trip but after a close inspection of the room when we arrived I was happy and had no problems sleeping on the very comfy bed. We also ate at the Mexican restaurant (I think is was called Diablos) and the Chinese Noodle restaurant at the hotel and both meals were very good. The Noodle restaurant was one of our best meals in Veags and I would highly recommend it - there were six of us and we each ordered something different and then shared it and all the dishes had their own unique flavour and were wonderful! I also liked that there was a Starbucks and McDonalds downstair and in the morning there were short lines and hot coffee only a minute away!! I can say that I am not a big gambler so I wasn't expecting much when I decided to try the slot machines at the Monte Carlo but for the first time ever in Vegas I actually won money every time I played at our hotel !!! I have to admit I had fun playing them!! I do agree with other reviews that it is an average hotel for Vegas but for what we paid I have no complaints and if I did I would totally be telling you here as I value Trip Advisor and the honest opinions that people post.

We checked in and asked if there were any upgrades and were told they were booked. But in the same breath, he announced that he was giving us a good room with a view. We went up to the room only to find on the non smoking floor, a room saturated with cigarette smell. Housekeeping should have informed the front desk. Anyway, back downstairs to the front desk. Given another room. When we arrived at the door, the electronic key wouldn't work. Back down to the front desk. By this time, I was already unhappy. The desk reissued the keys and we finally entered our room,not a great view, but no cigarette smell. Tired, we decided to order room service. No room service menu. The front desk was adamant that a menu had to be in the room. There was none, finally a menu arrived. We had no numbers on the phone, just holes where the plate should have been, so we didn't even know what number to call for room service, we had to call the front desk and ask for the number to room service. The toilet lid wouldn't stay up for the hubby, therefore he had to stand to the side, hold up the lid. The door on the TV stand wouldn't stay open, so we had to prop it open with a towel. The tub took forever to drain, and their was mold growing in the shower. Mold in the desert, that's a new one to me. The restaurants in the hotel was another hot topic. It took forever to be waited on in the cafe. On one occasion, we actually waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order, we finally just got up to leave and the desk insisted we pay for our coffee and tea, even though we explained that we had waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order, and we were leaving upset. Unbelievablely, they still insisted on payment. When no ticket could be located for the drink order, they finally said, forget it. We already had! There is no signs for the high roller line. After standing in a line for 10 minutes waiting to be seated, we were told that we were in the wrong line, when I asked how was I to know that, she explained there was no sign, I should have asked. I said we had been there on 2 other occasions, and never given this information. She said, \"oh well\". Customer service is not their strong suit, matter of fact, it is no where to be found on this property. The bed was the only thing great in this hotel.

I have been reading all the reveiws prior to leaving and noticed there were some negative but mostly positve, so I was a tad nervous about staying here. We checked in wednesday the 23rd at 3pm and it was maybe a 5 min wait to check in, the front desk staff was nice and the whole process took less than 3 minites. the nice thing about the monte carlo I liked was that there was only 1 set of elevators and you don't need to walk through the casino or half way around the property like some other places. The rooms were spotless and I am a neat freak, smelt clean and the 2 other couples said the same thing about there rooms, the rooms are defenatly a not a 10 out of 10 though, we all thought the A/C was a joke I never looked into it but it was very weak and deffinatly didn't cool the room down, overall that was the only flaw I had with the room and the other 2 couples as well, water preasure and plumbing were all fine but the shower head is a little on the low side so if you are over 6ft you will have some issues. The casno was the best smelling casino we went in the whole trip, we were in alot and the monte carlo was hands down the best smelling, sure there are hundreds of people smoking but you only notice it if you are close to somebody smoking. We ate at diablos 2 times and the cafe 1 time, all the meals and drinks were very good and very resinable, the drink service in the casino was unbelivable, you are asked for a drink every 15 mins, they were very good at making sure your beverage was full. The pool area is nice with a good atmospere and tunes, there are alot of shaded areas in the pool so get a chair early if you want the sun or you will be against the wall at the beach vollyball court, that as well was a neat feature of the property. Im really not a breakfast person so having the food court downstairs was nice option for breakfast and a late night snack.
