I have found the rooms to be clean and quite spacious. The beds are large and comfortable and the bathrooms are large and well stocked if a little dated in the old wing of the hotel. The food is fairly standard but the service in the restaurant is poor with breakfast waiting times for orders of up to twenty minutes. The idea of having the restaurant area in reception with just a veil spearating it from the entrance is not akin to hotels of this supposed standard and this makes the restaurant look cheap and nasty. The rooms do not have minibars which seems a bit strange for a hotel of this supposed standard, necessitating a long walk to the gym to get a drink from a vending machine at 3am!! The decor of the hotel is good in places an poor in others and generally could do a lot better.", "title": "Not all bad....Great gym!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "AlecCampbell", "date": "June 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 5372065}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Very poor", "text": "Things that are good are the setting which is great (although I am not a golfer I can see how this would be a good course for any keen enthusiast) and the gym which is easily fitness club standard on three levels with plenty of equipment and facilities.

(this is despite us dining at 7.45pm and the restuarant being half empty). The meals were also small. Then on to the bar which stopped taking cash at 11pm (very early for a hotel) and after that the drinks were charged to your room (which allowed extra VAT to be charged on top).

We arrived Thursday afternoon and checked in early as our room was already prepeared. This was in the 'newer' part of the hotel and was very large indeed. Very big double bed, separate seating area and a new very clean bathroom with shower. Straight out onto the course, unfortunately there was a very large society finishing, so the round was very slow - 4 hours for 12 holes when we gave up. Dinner in the evening was very good, with plenty to choose from on the menu. Breakfast the next day was again very good, plenty of hot and cold food to choose from and you could help yourself to as much as you wanted. We played golf in the morning on the Friday and it couldn't have been different from the previous day. There was virtually no-one on the course, which was in fantastic condition, so we had a great day - 4 hours for the complete round. Dinner in the evening was as good as the previous night, with plenty of choice, the service was effiecient and the staff friendly. Breakfast on the Saturday was similar to the previous day, although there were more people as they were preparing for a wedding. Our final round of golf was again very good, more players as it was the weekend, but still a fairly quick round - 4 1/2 hours. All in all, we had an excellent stay and could hardly fault the hotel or the golf course. We wouldn't hesitate in returning.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "September 27, 2005", "id": 3943071}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Great potential, but needs a lot of work", "text": "First problem was when we arrived and they had no record of our internet booking. We ordered drinks and sandwiches whilst waiting for room to be allocated. Despite very few people in dining/reception area, drinks took 15minutes to arrive and white wine was warm. Sandwiches took another 10 minutes and the order was wrong - they said that they had run out of white bread but had not bothered to check if brown was OK.

The room was a good size, with views over the golf course, but the bathroom was extremely scruffy with a tatty hardboard side on the bath, crumbling plaster, the soap dispenser had come off wall and was stuck in the corner of the bath, etc, etc. The room was on the first floor and had a balcony running right around the wing, so people could walk straight past our full length window with nothing to stop them looking in.

When I commented on the state of the stairs, she agreed that it was a total mess and asked someone to sort it out. She was appalled at the bathroom and said that the tiles had come off and not been replaced and tried to get us another room. Unfortunately, whilst the bathroom of the second room was in a better state, it looked out over a rooftop and pipes, so we decided, on balance, to stick with the first room. Everywhere in this part of the building was scruffy - doors were left open showing the contents of cleaning and linen cupboards, paintwork was badly scuffed, hallways & stairways looked dirty, damp smell, etc. Room was adequate, but could have done with a really good clean.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "serenitey", "date": "February 7, 2005", "id": 3166822}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Don't go for Valentine's Night!!!!

I had booked a session in the salon, but was limited to very few treatments because they would only allocate 1 hour, despite the appointment book appearing to be virtually empty - so I cancelled. My request to join a scheduled Pilates class was declined on the grounds that no-one else had their names down for it. The reception bar was chilly and unwelcoming because the automatic door kept opening. The Brasserie restaurant was ok - if you really want to eat in a reception area with a view of everyone coming in or out of the hotel and hearing the reception phone ringing all the time. (At breakfast on Tuesday, I asked a waiter if he could get someone to answer it as it had rung continually for about 20 minutes and there was no-one in reception.)
