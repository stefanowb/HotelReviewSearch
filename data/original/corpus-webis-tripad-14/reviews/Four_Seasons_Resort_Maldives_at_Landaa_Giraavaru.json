Our full board had been listed as half board and payment hadn't arrived and the room was a twin rather than double villa with sunset view. He took care of it all. No hassles, no worries, just leave it to me he said. No hollow promise either. After I mentioned that the missus couldn't see the sunset from the outstanding water villa, as soon as another became available they moved us. He checked in on us throughout the stay. Didn't attempt to sell us anything, just pleasantly told us what was available should we wish to partake. That was the whole feel of the place, you could do as much or as little as you wanted, spend as much or little as you wanted, and beware it will cost you a 2nd mortgage!
