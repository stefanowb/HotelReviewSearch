As another reviewer has said, the room is clean and comfortable but not fancy. Nice bathroom and decent bed which is most important. From our room you could see the steeples of the cathedral and it was magnificent. you do have to cart your luggage upstairs, fortunately we were only up one flight of stairs. The breakfast is very European and I agree the lady serving the coffee is the friendliest of all the staff. There are many shops just behind (? if I have my directions right) that stretch for a mile or more. With many dress shops etc. The farmers market is okay for food stuff but disappointing in any souvenirs. I do recommend going on the Overlord tour of the beaches (see separate review) and the tapestries and we also went to Honfleur which I highly recommend. There is so much to do in Normandy that I wish we could have spent a week or two here. Mont St. Michel to me is the 2nd most important visit, after the beaches.
