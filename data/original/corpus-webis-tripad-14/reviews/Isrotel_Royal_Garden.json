The Eilat beach is shocking and we spent days by the poolside unless sightseeing at the dolphinarium, aquarium or taking a day triptop Petra in Jordan (which I recommend) .

We had a fantastic holiday and the hotel service and facilities were execellent. The hotel staff were very efficient and friendly and the place was very clean and tidy at all times. The only thing I would say is that upon check-in they should go through the facilities available within the complex as we didnt have a clue what was available until we found out ourselves but apart from that this is a beautiful place to stay and we will definitely go there again. The pools were really nice and clean. We also watched a very good show which was put on by the hotel. We visited the dolphin reef where my daughter and I snorkelled with the dolphins which was an execellent experience and very efficiently done. We did full day tours to Jerusalem and Petra which were amazing both with execellent tour guides. All in all a great holiday was had by all - 2 adults aged 43 and 40 and one child 12 years old.
