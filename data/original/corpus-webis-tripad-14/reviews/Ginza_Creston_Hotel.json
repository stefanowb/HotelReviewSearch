The New Hankyu was excellent most areas. We arrived early, and they would not let us check in early, but we managed to store our bags. Once we checked in, we found the place excellent. Location was superb. We could walk to Ginza in about 15 minutes. We walked to the imperial palace in about 20-25 minutes. It was close to the train stations, and location overall was excellent. The room was very very large for Japanses hotels. The service was always excellent. The bed was hard as a rock, but ok for us. The massaging chair was nice, but would have been of more use if I found the instructions on the first day of our stay, not the last. To get there from the airport catch the limo bus to TCAT terminal (2900 yen each). Then catch a taxi to the building. This will cost abouut 1200 yen. Things to do. Check out the fish markets, or Ginza. Catch a subway to akihabara. Catch a short train trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Walk around Tokyo.
