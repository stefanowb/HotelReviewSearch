After my 11 hour flight from Heathrow, London, it was a most welcome sight.\u2028I was treated like a visiting dignitary, shown to my room and made to feel completely at ease.\u2028The staff were exemplary, nothing was too much for them and again I felt completely at ease and truly welcome. \u2028On the night where they were fully booked (half-way through my stay), I dined in a lovely part of the House, away from the crowds of conference attendees and was served a delicious meal before being driven to the Pheasant Hill Country House nearby, where I stayed for the night. \u2028The following day, it felt like going back to meet old friends.\u2028I can highly recommend this retreat from a long day at the office, where you can really unwind and recharge your batteries.\u2028My only complaint? I didn't stay there long enough but that's not River Meadow Manor's fault; it's my own stud fault!", "title": "Serene Irene River Meadow Manor", "user": "OldVillain", "date": "February 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125287102}], "location": {"country": "South Africa", "continent": "Africa", "city": "Irene"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 0, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "River Meadow Manor Irene, Africa", "slim_ranking": 0.333333333333, "description": "Tucked away in tranquil Irene amid lush green pastures and old oak trees lies a sparkling gem.
