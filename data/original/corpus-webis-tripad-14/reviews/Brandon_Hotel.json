The beds were ok, and the room good. Lobby is really nice but the room was in the older part of the hotel. The breakfast included was a nice buffet, one of the better ones I got on my week in Ireland, but oddly, we watched the waitress ask every table if they wanted eggs....but us! After 15 minutes I finally asked if we got eggs with our meal and she said \"yes what do you want?\".

I was given a room in the old part - they still use old fashioned room keys! The decor was also old fashioned - worn pattered carpet on the stairs and corridors, dark stained furniture and doors making the place dark and depressing. The room was a decent size but the bed linen on both beds consisted of stained blankets that didn't match. During both nights it was cold in the room (I could not turn on the heater) and there were no spare blankets.On the plus side the bar was modern with comfortable squashy leather couches and the residents lounge was large and very quiet, at least during the day.The hotel is centrally located. good for checking out the shops in town, Siamsa Tire theatre or the Aquadome are all very close by.
