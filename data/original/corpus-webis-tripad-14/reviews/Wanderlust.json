My boyfriend and I stayed on two separate occasions, storing our luggage for a total of 3 weeks and our bags were already in the rooms each time we checked in. We stayed in the spaceship whimsical room as well as one of the pantone rooms. The Pantone room is definitely capsule style, quite cramped. The whimsical room is more spacious with the bathtub a nice touch. Also, there is a restaurant in the alley by the hotel that is open until 4 am which I think could be a noise problem on weekends if you're on that side of the building.
