The views over the valley and river were absolutely stunning and the hotel grounds need to be explored to be fully appreciated, there are secluded little paradises along the entire walkway which looks fabulous at night. The room itself was unreal, it was massive with living area including an Apple TV stored with 1000's of songs and 100's of movies. The bathroom is huge and modern, whilst somehow holding onto the beauty of Bali. The bathroom has a glass wall that overlooks the valley (or you can close privacy blinds) and the entire room has glass doors and windows so you never stop being in awe of your surroundings. The staff were just as exceptional here as at Komaneka at Monkey Forest as was the afternoon tea, water, gifts, fruit and nightly turn down service complete with night gown. The day spa has it's rooms overlooking the river running through the valley and whilst I didn't have time to use the facilities, the prices seemed very reasonable compared with other hotel in house services. As you wander through this magnificent property, you will discover the wedding chapel which is beautiful and modern and looks to be able to accommodate a decent sized wedding. It seems nothing has been overlooked at this hotel, you don't even need insect repellant as it's in the room. The included breakfast is unusual in that it's a table service rather than buffet, which is a refreshing change and we never left breakfast wanting more.
