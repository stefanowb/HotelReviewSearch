My 18 year od daughter was very excited when she spotted it was also karaoke night! The food portions were huge and great value. The staff were very professional and asked for my daughter's ID which she showed. They apologised profusely but we understood they were only doing their job. It was supposed to be a quick visit but we ended up there until closing time. It was a fun night and the DJ was entertaining. It was always busy and it was easy to see why it's so popular.", "user": "94Gill", "date": "October 25, 2013", "id": 182394467}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited October 2013", "text": "We booked in for the Enchanted Forest Menu before heading on to the bus leaving from the Fisher's Hotel.
