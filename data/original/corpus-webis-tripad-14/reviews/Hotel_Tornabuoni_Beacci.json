I wanted a hotel that was historic, well located and warm and welcoming. I was not disappointed. The hotel is beautiful and the staff, especially Angelo, were excellent in every regard. From the owner, Mr. Beacci, to the woman who cleaned my room-each person was warm and friendly and made you feel like you were a guest in their home. Each and every person in my group loved this hotel. Each room is different and not one was a disappointment. The common areas are beautiful, especially the roof top garden patio. Views from the rooms are a memory you will cherish. This is definately an oasis of peace within walking distance of all of the highlights of Florence. The food was outstanding. Breakfast pleantiful and sustaining. Dinner served on the beautiful patio is definately a special event. If you are looking for a hotel that gives you a feeling of Florence, this is a great choice.
