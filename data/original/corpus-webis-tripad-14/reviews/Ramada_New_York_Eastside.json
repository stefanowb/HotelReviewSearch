For the price, you could do a lot worse than this solidly middle class hotel! This was a safe and comfortable place. And there were absolutely no bugs! Believe me, I checked this out thoroughly after being terrified by reading reviews after I'd booked the room. The only complaint I had was that the ceramic tiles in the bathroom need to be regrouted as the grout looks kind of stained as years go by, which is not a big deal, just not appealing to look at. There is nowhere to put anything in the bathroom--any little shelf would have been nice. I couldn't put anything on top of the toilet tank because it was slanted, and the little pedestal sink had no room to put anything down.
