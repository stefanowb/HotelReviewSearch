After a long drive it felt great to be greeted so warmly at the front desk. Claudia was especially friendly and helpful. She not only calmed me down about my missing wallet (which I eventually found) but was extremely helpful and informative about things to see in the area and regarding any other questions or concerns we had about our stay and room. The hotel room was fresh and clean. All the bedding appeared brand new and I was well rested with the comfortable and fluffy pillows and blanket. Breakfast was delicious with a great and satisfying selection. I looked forward to the scrambled eggs each morning! Although I never used them, the breakfast to go bags that were available up front are a fantastic idea! A decent selection of teas and coffee were readily available 24 hours down at the lobby and cookies at the front desk in the evening! The pool and jaccuzzi were warm and clean.
