It was a see-through glass door, so there was no privacy at all on that account. It was sort of funny for us but I imagine it could get a bit uncomfortable for somebody else.I've to admit that the staff didn't impress me that much except one guy, that was kind and professional.The hotel is in a good position to reach almost every place and considering everything, it was a very good value for money.", "helpfulness": 15, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "December 25, 2003", "id": 1530610}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "I loved the hotel", "text": "This is a small botique hotel that is within walking distance to many of the tourist sights of Madrid.

Right in the middle of the trendy neighborhood Chueca, which is full of cute shops, great restaurants and bars, and happening gay nightlife. However, our room, which faced the street but was on the 6th floor, was very quiet! We also had a balcony which was fabulous. The room was modest, but clean, and the free internet was a bonus (although it would be nice if the room with the computers was air conditioned, too). The AC in the rooms is controlled individually and you can leave it on when you leave, which makes for a blissfully cool return in August!

I travelled with two friends and shared a triple room. The room was a bit small, BUT realize that we are Americans, so everything in Europe is small compared to what we're used to. The bathroom is as everyone mentioned... one wall of frosted glass with a squre filigree cut out that let's you see the person sitting down... if you catch my drift. It was conventional and worked for three ladies that had way TOO MUCH luggage. Noise was a factor in the beginning but after 10 days in Spain we realized that it's pretty much the same anywhere you stay (walls are thin). It wasn't terrible but we did hear party people coming in at 5am. We did the same thing to our neighbors the following night so, what can you do but say \"Es lo que es\" (it is what it is). We stayed there our first night in Madrid and went on to do a tour throughout Andalucia. Petit Palace Ducal was pretty inexpensive, compared to the other hotels. You do have to pay for breakfast, I recommend going somewhere else for breakfast if you have the time... if you don't have the time, go for it... just know it is a bit pricey but decent. Very different for Americans, you have to remember you're in another country, be careful with the coffee machine... it's like espresso... didn't drink the coffee, went down the street to Starbucks. There are pubs, restaurants, bars (Cervecias), shops all around. No need to worry about needing transportation. We actually used the metro to get to our hotel from the Airport (Barajas), the maps are straight forward and we got there easily (navigation wise), lugging our 60lb luggaage was a different story. My point is, use the metro. It is less expensive, pretty easy to use and takes you pretty much all over. The staff is as helpful as they can be BUT their English was like my Spanish... which wasn't very good. But between my bad Spanish and their bad English... it worked itself out. All in all it was great for the money.
