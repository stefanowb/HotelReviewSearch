Staff is very fiendly (by being not concerned very much, just to guide what you need). Can get in any time in your room as separate keys are provided for quiet entry without distubing others. Rooms are near busy road but very comfortable with separate bathrooms which are clean. They deposit 30 Euro for keys, which are refunded during check out.
