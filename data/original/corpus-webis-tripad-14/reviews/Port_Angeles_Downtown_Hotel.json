That is not an issue as the weather is cool even in summers. The major issue is the sea gulls in the area have made a home on the roof of this hotel; the screaching from these birds was horrendous, they are louder than any sea gull i have ever witnessed. I actually refused to stay here, so i can not comment on whether the gulls are loud in the middle of the night but at even 8pm it was severe. The reason i refused to stay here is that the roof of the connecting building, which happens to run adjacent to many of the rooms is covered in sea gull stool. So, one peaks out the window to discover a mere few feet away, right outside your window, bird stool, and large amounts of it. Clearly little attempt has been made to clean the roof. The major issue with copious bird detriment is there are two major types of fungus that begin to thrive on such stool. This fungus becomes air borne and can lead to serious lung infections in humans, and can even lead to death in those with any immune compromise. As a physician, i was not going to stay here and risk compromising my health.", "user": "westpalmdoc", "date": "August 16, 2009", "id": 37874424}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The stay at the Downtown Hotel was pretty nice.
