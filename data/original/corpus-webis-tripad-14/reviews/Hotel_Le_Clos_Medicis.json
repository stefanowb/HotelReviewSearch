At 280 euros a night in high season, Clos Medicis was a bit outside our normal range, but in the end we were very happy with the choice and had a great weekend. Our room (#65) was on the top floor, with a very comfortable bed, and was in fact a duplex, with a well designed bathroom on the second floor. Staff were extremely polite and pleasant, and we were treated very well, from arrival to departure.

RER Luxembourg is very close and buses are good too. I was lucky and had one of the two hotel balconies. I booked up many months ago and specially requested it. Paris was very very hot last weekend so I loved being able to sit out. Breakfast al fresco was a treat - good coffee and a decent continental selection at a reasonable price.
