We chose this place randomly, looking for an inexpensive resort close to the airport for our first trip to Cancun and we lucked out, the staff and other guests were fun, the food was good and the atmosphere was great. We travel quite a bit and were not disappointed with the room, the food and drink, the staff or the beach, but we aren't complainers either. You need to be flexible to have fun and go with the flow, but nothing went wrong with our stay. We felt like we found a home there after just a few hours, everyone was friendly and filled us in on what we needed to know about the hotel and Cancun. Many guests had been there several times and that's a pretty good recommendation. The fact that there weren't any kids there made it even better but there wasn't much risque behavior, just a few topless sunbathers on the beach, so we didn't feel uncomfortable.

This was our second trip to Mexico and we were very disappointed with this resort. The room service never seemed to get our order correct and they would leave the dirty dishes in the hall all day long so ants and other insects were crawling on the plates. The resort itself was pretty and aside from the dirty dishes, they were mostly clean. Our room, however, had dirty sheets placed on the bed twice during our stay and we had to ask for our coffee to be replaced everyday. They would not replace our coffee cups, so we had to drink it from the glass cups they give you for water. The bartenders were pretty awesome, however, and made up for some of the issues we were having. THe beach is gorgeous and the pool was very nice, but cold. Not much privacy at the hotel but it was located close to shopping and the airport. The food was ok, the buffet was pretty typical, nothing to rave about. The mid-day activities and the billiards were fun. The management was pretty awful, had a couple of issues and was basically told to \"stay somewhere else\". I guess you get what you pay for and it's a pretty inexpensive rate.
