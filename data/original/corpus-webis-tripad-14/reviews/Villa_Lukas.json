After many hours on the internet and using trip advisor as my main source of information I decided to book Villas Lukas in Imerovigli, Santorini for a weeks stay. Helen made arrangements for a van to pick us up at the airport. Upon arrival to Imerovigli we were amazed at how absolutely gorgeous it was. I was a little nervous about what our accommodations would be like but it was a pleasant surprise. Our apartment was spacious, traditional and very clean. Our friends had an apartment beside us and we shared a very large balcony. The view from the balcony was spectacular. We felt that we had one of the best views and beautiful sunsets of anywhere on the island. The only complaint I would have was that the beds were very uncomfortable although I found that most of the beds in greece weren't the most comfortable mattresses. I would also recommend that Villas Vukas invest in lounge chairs for the balcony. The complaints are minor compaired to the wonderful memories we have of Santorini and Villas Lukas. I would definately recommend Villas Lukas to anyone visiting Santorini. I would also recommend Imerovigli over Fira and Oia. it is much less crowded and less touristy.", "title": "Amazing View", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "lych13", "date": "October 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 47468235}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Unforgettable holidays in a room with amazing view.

The location is perfect and the view gorgeous. The room was beautifully decorated and super clean. We wanted to rent a car and were assisted in doing so by Helen (the owner's daughter). It was extremely convenient. There is a free parking area a few steps away from the entrance of Villa Lukas. We felt very welcomed at Villa Lukas. The only part we didn't like was the bed : hard as a rock, but per our experiences it seems to be normal in Greece. There is a convenient store across the street. That was helpful. We had read on Tripadvisor that the neighboring hotel had a pool you could use and that is true. We didn't use their pool but we enjoyed their jacuzzi instead, what a treat!!! Overall, we are extremely satisfied with Villa Lukas. It is a beautiful and quiet place. There are so many choices in Santorini and it was difficult for us to choose but we can honestly say that we felt we made the right choice considering how affordable it was. it was a great value.", "title": "an enchanting experience", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "MiVoo", "date": "September 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 44924186}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "I had the opportunity of staying at Villa Lukas for a week this September and I found the hotel great, as it combines prices that are affordable with the best view around the island of Santorini.
