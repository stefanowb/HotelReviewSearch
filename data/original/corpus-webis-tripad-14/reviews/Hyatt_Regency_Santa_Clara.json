I'm confused why would a hotel in the heart of Silicon Valley with high tech titans such as Yahoo, Google, Cisco System down the street have poor internet service. The T-mobile hot spot was, ok to slow, low bandwidth, took for ever from some sites to load. Spent 30 minutes on the phone with CS to try to get it to work faster, no luck. Front Desk was no help at all, gave me the deer in the headlights look, they were ZERO help. BTW brand new MacBook Pro no problems at any hotel, airport, coffee shop, etc. Was unable to get my work done at this \"business hotel?\", so I checked out went to a Hyatt Place in Fremont where the wireless service worked like a charm. Dear Hyatt if your going to have a hotel in the high tech capital of the world it should provide top of the line, hassle free internet service. You front desk also need to be trained on how to help guest when they are having trouble with a service IN YOUR HOTEL, they should not just stand there and give you the I dunno what to do look.

I like it because it's close to my office, the service is good and always very friendly, the rooms are well-appointed, stylish, comfortable and clean, and it's hyatt-predictability all-around. i find the lack of food options an issue and the 'fresca' restaurant is below average; hoewver, the room service is good and fast (try to cobb salad which I can highly recommend for a solo dinner in the room). The hotel could use a good coffee bar. What i don't like about the hotel is the parking situation -- often the front lot fills up and you have to park in the back convention center parking structure. Also, when there are large conventions, the hotel really fills up and the elevators get very, very slow as a result.
