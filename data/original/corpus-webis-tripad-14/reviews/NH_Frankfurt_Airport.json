Its shuttle bus runs like clockwork every twenty minutes and can be relied on for punctual delivery back to the airport. The hotel is a modern three story facility with well appointed rooms, all the expected amenities including fitness center and INTERNET access, but has no A/C which at summer temperatures exceeding 80 degrees causes one to keep windows open. Thus, rooms facing the street are not for light sleepers, a room facing the inner court should be requested instead. Its competent, friendly, and helpful front desk staff provides for efficient check-in and out. as its mostly business client\u00e8le would expect. Rates are generally good value for what is offered, but at times of major events in Frankfurt can be overpriced, as is typical for the hospitality industry. The restaurant serves great food with menus changing every three months, and the wine list offers a selection for every taste.The breakfast buffet , served after 6 a.m. is extensive in its offerings. Although S-trains connect the airport with the city center in short intervals, this hotel is not in an ideal location for those doing business in the city center or visiting tourist spots, but could not be beat at what it is meant to be, an airport hotel.
