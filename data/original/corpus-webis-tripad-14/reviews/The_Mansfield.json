Our plane arrived at 6am and we checked in at 7am. A room was ready for us and we were allowed to go right up and get ready for our day. While the room was fairly small (but definatley not tiny), as I was walking around the rest of Manhattan, I realized that unless you want to spend a lot of money, ALL rooms are going to be small. It is a very small island packed with millions of people afterall.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 13, 2004", "id": 2294509}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Price Line it.", "text": "The hotel was right in the heart of Midtown--2 blocks from Times Square and half a block from 5th Ave. The only complaint I would have to have about the hotel is the lack of ventilation in the bathroom.

The sofitel is just across the street. The glitz of the website is positively NOT indicative of this small, run-down, a tad dirty hotel. I paid $250 here through the hotel website and feel like i was really taken. The room was semi-clean, we found trash in the cans and the pillow smelled of perspiration. My daughter got 3 bruises in the bathroom as you couldn't turn around without injuring yourself on the sink, wall, tub, wall phone, etc. amazingly small, would call it teeny or tiny instead. The comp breakfast consisted of no more than dry bagels, muffins and coffee. we had to wait for juice refills. the computers froze upon arrival and we had a 15 minute wait at check in. our room 202 was ON THE STREET and garbage trucks were cruising all night long...no sleep, also the room was just above the entry foyer and at the bar's closing there was very loud laughter that made it impossible to relax...yet another thing, the room straddled the staircase...all this at $250 a night.
