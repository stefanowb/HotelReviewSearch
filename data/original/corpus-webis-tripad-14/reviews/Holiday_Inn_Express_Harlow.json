Whilst there were country hotels nearer to the wedding venue our choice was largely dictated by the fact I needed three rooms for my family, including my son and his partner who were travelling up from London by train. So we plumped for here on the basis it offered a good compromise- about half the price of a country hotel, close to the station and easy access to major roads but in a new town centre that has no charm whatsoever. The rooms were clean and spacious and the beds comfortable. Breakfast was okay and the service perfectly friendly. The car park is small but you can use, for \u00a33 per day, the multi storey next door. Harlow is a dump (apologies to all who live there!) and the hotel is located next to the jobcentre, a police station and a car park - that is not a romantic location! However, as a place to sleep that is clean it is fine.", "title": "You don't go to Harlow for your holiday!", "user": "BigMac58", "date": "April 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 159193036}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed here on a business trip, hotel is fairly new and I was expecting it to be clean but this was exceptional The room was modern and well fitted, for the money it was fantastic.", "title": "Fresh and new, friendly staff and very accomodating", "user": "Richard S", "date": "April 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 159166615}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The only slight downside is the size of the car park, but if you go on a motorbike there is loads of room!", "title": "good value, excellent hotel", "user": "The_gardening_girl", "date": "April 28, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 159049541}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled on business", "text": "I would definitely stay at this hotel again, for business or pleasure.", "title": "Just the job", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "JarvisandCo", "date": "April 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158197543}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a new hotel and they have done a really good job on it, the rooms are spacious and furnished to a high standard for this type of hotel and the bathroom has a massive shower, the micron let's it down a bit but it fiddling work to a degree.", "title": "WOW", "user": "Amy G", "date": "April 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 158179020}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great hotel in centre of town", "text": "I stayed here to visit my relatives.
