The room is very good, but there are some unusual bad aspects, like you cannot open the window, lack of water in one day (and soon after the water came with strange colours) and missing some articles, like robe for just one when we are in two people. The reception staff when we got to the hotel were not also very friendly, and he gave zero instructions about the hotel. We have also another problem, our credit card was charged twice (one without our authorization) and we have no appropriate explanations about that. The location is ok, next to a great mall and supermarket, but a bit far (about a 20 minutos walk) from the metro. Good aspects are the breakfast and the fitness area.", "title": "Could be better", "user": "Fabio_Duarte", "date": "May 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 64729910}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Excellent Hotel!
