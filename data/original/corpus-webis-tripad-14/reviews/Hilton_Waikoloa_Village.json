Takes a good 20 mins (sometimes more) from the entrance to any room, walking or tram. Ive been telling people \"its the mainlands version of what we think Hawaii should look like\" Beatiful grounds and amazing art but unless you want to do whats right outside your tower, expect it to be a mini hike. I was disappointed with the tiny \"beach\" entrance. Beautiful, but very small and all rock. It took 30 mins to get to the \"adult\" pool from my room by tram. It was probably more suited for a family not wanting to leave the resort for the entirety of their stay rather than a mid 30's couple want to experiance Hawaii. Was quite disappointed with room. Great veiw of ocean and dolphines. Safe was broke, phone was very staticy (cell wouldnt get signal inside room half the time) no outlet by the bed (VERY COMFORTBLE though) only one side table. The A/C sucked. The couch was something I would of expected at Days Inn or something. The grounds were beautiful with alot of features, just really spread out. Room was soso, I guess you are more so paying for the veiws and grounds. For the same amount of money we rented a private 3,000 sq ft beachfront house with private pool in gated community in Kona, 20 miles south.

First time 17 years ago on my honey moon and then two times with my son when he was little. Now he is 14 and we returned for spring break.

You can walk, boat or ride between the proproerties, although the boat has limits hours and the monorail is also not that frequent. They are the Lagoon towers, The Palace Towers and the Ocean Towers. The most desirable is the Lagoon, then Palace and then Ocean. That is because of the length of distance between them and the \"action\" aras of the hotel which is the lagoon, the main pools and the dolphin enclosures.

Ironically, despit having a really nice time otherwise, this experience - and pulling out my shoulder luggin the big bags, clouds my feelings about the trip.
