I also had room service food which was some fo the ebst I have eaten. The gym is great as is the pool. The location near the airport is reason why lots of people choose the hotel, although it it is then quite way to south Mumbai. The niggles - the lobby is overwhelming - not at all welcoming. The layout of the building, with its long corridors and the peeling grey vinyl cladding occasionally strike you as more prison-like than hotel-like. The spacious rooms have a tiny amount of wardrobe space - a couple with 2 suitcases are going to be really stuck! The mini-bar is locked and no-one offered a key.
