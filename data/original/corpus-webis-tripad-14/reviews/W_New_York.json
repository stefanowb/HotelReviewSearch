In fact, we stayed at THIS W hotel when it first opened back in the 90's. Forgot how well-located this particular W is given all the W options in NYC - chose it since our focus was midtown, Upper East Side and Central Park. Delighted to see it's been beautifully well-kept. We've noticed erratic service from W to W, sometimes bordering on over-the-top snobbiness and surliness. Happy to report, this W really shined with welcoming and professional service at the front desk and concierge desk (very helpful especially during super busy weekend with marathon, rock concert, halloween, etc.), and a friendly, attentive and thorough housekeeping staff. The room was well-appointed and very tidy. We had a \"wonderful\" room which I think is a smaller room -- however, we were only there for 2 nights, so it was fine. The bathroom was VERY spacious with a roomy and luxurious shower & the standard \"W\" Bliss toiletries (LOVE!). We had an issue with our heater being WAY TOO LOUD, but engineering fixed this quite swiftly for which we were quite grateful. There's a little computer in the lobby that allows you to check in for your flight which is a nice touch. The lobby lounge was inviting and cozy. While there was no coffee maker in the room, I believe you could order one up. Nonetheless, it's too bad they just don't offer free coffee in the lobby for a bit in the morning? We also tried out the Acura car service offer and were almost completely put-off by the booking lady's pretentiousness or crabbiness (too many inane questions from the throngs?) -- however, glad we did it, the experience is MUCH more relaxing than a typical NYC cab ride (especially since we love Acura!) One tip, avoid the W store if you have little patience for overt snobbiness -- The sales staff in the boutique were completely obnoxious and rude -- to the point where I felt like slapping one of them for being utterly disrespectful and \"holier\" than thou. (What are they thinking? A distasteful slice of \"Mean Girls\") I'd like to say the treatment was limited to me, but with the exception of another customer that looked just like the sales girls, they treated others universally meanly.
