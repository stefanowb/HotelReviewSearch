Had a nice big room with a huge King Size bed. Very clean bedrooms and bathrooms. The Resort has a magnificent garden and you can chose between three pools. And once again the staff was very kind, friendly and helpful. Even the breakfast buffet was ok. It is nice anyway having breakfast overlooking the beach. But I would recommend to eat any other meal some place else because I think the kitchen in general is not the best. On the other side..why do so many people complain about food...the smokers in restaurants are worse, mostly australians. Location is great, only a short 25 minutes walk to Kuta or Seminyak. Will definately come back again. Have compared a lot of other hotels around Legian and Kuta and not once was as good considering what I paid for.
