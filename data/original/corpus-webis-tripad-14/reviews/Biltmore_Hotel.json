We were upgraded to a lovely room with a nice view of the pool and golf course. Being September,and hurricane season, the hotel was not crowded, so it was wonderfully relaxing. We found everyone on the staff to be exceptionally courteous and helpful without being overbearing. We had breakfast and lunch and I thought it was fairly priced for a hotel ,and the food was quite good. The pool is huge and and pleasant. The lobby is dark, but it is the decorating syle of the 1920's, I thought it was very interesting. Our room was bright and kept exceptionally clean.

The first problem was trying to get a cup of coffee. We went to the general restaurant and was told that it was being set for the evening we were directed by a rather offish hostess to \"the coffee shop\". This is only a shop to get coffee in a cardboeard cup to take away. when we asked where we could sit down and be served with coffee in a real cup , she was very rude and told us we could not get it. This is a 5 star hotel - one of the leading hotels in the world group. We then asked at front desk and again was told to go back to the Coffee Shop. when we said that we wanted just a cup of coffee. we were brushed off. We ended up in our room having to have room service. we booked dinner in the restaurant for the next night and was not asked whether we wanted to sit inside or on the terrace. When we arrived the next day, the hostess immediateley told us that outside was not available. when we queried why we were not given the opportuniity when we booked she just ignored our comment. Eventually a manager sympathised and offered us a complimentary brunch. When we went to check out- this Complimentary meal was charged at $165. I had to argue the point to ge it removed from the account. The bellmen, concierge and waiting staff were excellent but the other did not know how to communicate or look after their guests.
