It was 3 stars. The hotel was clean, the room large but very average and the bathroom was pretty basic. Still, this hotel is trying to appeal to the international traveler and can only be going in the right direction.

Its very close to the airport and the hotel provides free shuttle bus serv ice to and from. The town centre is a little bit away from the hotel but there are plenty of tuk-tuks available. The service in the hotel itself was first rate and the staff were only too happy to assist with any questions or problems I had. The room was quite modern, spotlessly clean with cable tv, a-con and nice sized bathroom. I hired a taxi for a few hours to take me around the countryside and the price will depend on the length of time and your negotiating skills. I paid around $30USD which I thought very good value for money. The hotel staff can advise on attractions in the area plus there are brochures available at the front desk. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip around this area.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Camjar", "date": "March 1, 2007", "id": 6898976}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Ubon Ratchathani"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 11, "very good": 8, "terrible": 5, "excellent": 4}, "aka": "Laithong Hotel Ubon Ratchathani", "slim_ranking": 0.416666666667}
