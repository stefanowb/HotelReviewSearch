Thought we'd give it a go & wow, we love Mexican food and this food was excellent. Service was spot on - really friendly & helpful. They were busy but our meals were still served quickly. Great atmosphere. Kids had a good range of choices (Mexican & non) - both had fajitas & loved them. Heaps of drink choices too. We checked out their menu online prior to going. We didn't book but I would imagine a booking is probably a safe choice (we got there just before 6pm on a Wed night). Speaking as a non-local (but a very regular visitor from an hour away), you would never spot the restaurant. It's part of an old pub on the main road in to town & pretty hard to spot but it was full of people & well worth visiting. We'll definitely be going back .... often!", "title": "Great Food", "user": "Blueysmrs", "date": "January 1, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 122357589}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited November 2011", "text": "I love this place. The food is great, the service is good, the atmosphere is fun, and the drinks are fantastic. I've been here a few times - Once with friends, and once with my partner - and we are planning to go back for a Christmas party. The food is mainly Mexican, however they do have some 'grill' stuff like steak. Not everything is super spicy, and there is something to suit everyone. Even vegetarians. All the meals we have ordered from here are a great serving size, and are pretty well priced. You can also check out their menu online on their website before going to see what they have. I recommend booking first too because they can get pretty busy. They also have happy hour which is great because they have special rates on some of their drinks... and they have so many different ones to try that it would be impossible to do in a single visit. They also have tapas if you don't feel like a full on meal. We had these before a meal one night, and they were delicious. Again, they have a variety of tapas, so there is something different for everyone. The atmosphere is fun - it is dressed up Mexican style, so there is lots to look at. Everyone seems to have fun when they are there, so it does get a little noisy. Either way, I recommend trying it.", "title": "Love it - Especially Happy Hour!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "corgan00", "date": "December 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 121476579}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "had an alright meal", "text": "was alright. enjoyed that atmosphere but was a tad noisy for us", "user": "Karlee R", "date": "November 14, 2011", "id": 120559068}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited August 2011", "text": "Went here recently catching up with some friends in Rocky having never been to this place before, although I've always wanted to try it. When we walked in it was like we had stepped into a cantina in downtown Guadalajara. There was a fantastic selection of Mexican dishes, when two of my friends ordered an entree of nachos to share it was bloody huge. I had the enchiladas with chilli con carne and they were fantastic, everyone enjoyed their meals. If you don't like Mexican don't fret, they do have a selection of other meals as well, two of my friends had the fish of the day. Also a good selection of Mexican beers, although I only had a Corona. Friendly, efficient service as well.

I have heard great things about the crooked cactus so was looking forward to eating there. I dined with a group of friends and the eight of us ordered various dishes, none of which were good. I was particularly disappointed in the nachos, it's not difficult to make nachos but these were soggy and cold. The bread with the dips was burnt but still cold. All of the hot dishes ordered were cold and either under or over cooked. On the positive side it's a great atmosphere and good service", "title": "Good atmosphere, terrible food", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sm21blue", "date": "July 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 133821268}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited June 2012", "text": "Awesome atmosphere.

All the waitstaff are friendly, efficient and do a really good job. The menu to me is very similar to Cactus Jacks (which closed down in Rocky) so I was so happy to find something to fill this void. Our last visit to the restaurant the food quality and taste seemed to be slipping but maybe it was just one of those nights. Previous visits to Crooked Cactus have left me very satisfied and happy. Not a genuine Mexican experience but good enough for me! The best thing about this restaurant is the birthday call out. If you let them know it is a guests bday then they will bring out their meal with sparklers, play a funny bday song and place a huge sombreo on the persons head. You can also see their name on the screen around the restaurant.
