The rooms need a facelift and the beds are pretty hard. Even though we booked a no smoking double room there were none avaliable so instead of telling us we were assigned a smoking room. When we went downstairs to be allocated another room we were bluntly told there are no other rooms so we had to settle for a twin room. The rate includes breakfast which was ok but once again not great. Its a clean safe hotel but I think I would probably stay elsewhere", "title": "Just OK", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "T-A-UK", "date": "June 20, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 17091669}], "location": {"country": "Japan", "region": "Chugoku", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 15, "very good": 37, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 11}, "slim_ranking": 0.14953271028}
