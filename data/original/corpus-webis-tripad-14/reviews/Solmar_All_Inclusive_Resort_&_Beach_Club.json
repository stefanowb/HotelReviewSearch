We stayed in the hotel portion, which consists of small suites right on the beach. The one-bedroom suites are behind the hotel units. We could hear the waves crashing every night. Everyone talks about the short walk to the marina - which by the way is pretty much where you go in Cabo - but the walk is not easy for everyone, especially if it is brutally hot, as it was during our stay. It's up and down hills, up against a concrete wall and past construction. We usually walked one way and took a cab back. Well worth six dollars. If you aren't into bar-hopping or fishing, there isn't a lot to do in Cabo. A couple of hours along the Marina, with vendors and timeshare people in your face constantly, and we were ready for the quiet seclusion of Solmar. The pool is fantastic, the swim-up bar a treat and a mariachi band seranades every evening. Housekeeping was immaculate (we found one bug the day we declined housekeeping because of our schedule). The staff was friendly and responsive. We took the shuttle to Playa de Grande one day and used the pool. Nice, but we preferred the exclusivity of Solmar. Take in the Saturday night fiesta. It's well worth it! Also the dinner cruise, which was very, very well organized and fun. Food was great as well. We took a water taxi to the public beach but after being accosted by vendors every minute, we left after a couple of hours because it wasn't exactly relaxing.
