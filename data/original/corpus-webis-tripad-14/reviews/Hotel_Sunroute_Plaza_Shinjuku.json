As for the hotel itself, it is a very beautiful, modern hotel. Everything was extremely clean and the sevice that you get in Japan can't compare to anywhere else in the world. All amenities were modern, with a refridgerator in the room and a very comfortable bed. There is a lounge area on the second floor with free internet access, coffee and tea.
