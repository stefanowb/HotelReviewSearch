The rooms are a decent size and adequately furnished. We had reserved a lakeview room and it ended up on the ground floor with a mostly blocked view of the lake and everyone could look into the room walking by. The room was also near the indoor pool and the hallway stunk of chlorine and was very humid. I probably should of asked for a different room but didn\u2019t. The room like the rest of the building is showing wear and tear and could use a thorough cleaning. The dining room has exposed heating ducts and you can see the buildup of dust on them. The landscaping around the outside screams for a good weeding and pruning. We did not use the spa (pricey) or golf but found the kayak/canoe rentals convenient.", "title": "Showing its age", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Steeler_Pens_fan", "date": "August 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 136769965}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled on business", "text": "Rocky Gap Lodge has a lot of potential, but it falls short in several areas.

The hotel has a lot to do around the lake, including hiking trails, swimming beaches, and paddle boats. The public spaces of the lower level and lobby level of the hotel are very attractive and well maintained. The rooms are a good size, they include two sinks, and they include many premium cable channels. The hotel also has a couple good dining options.
