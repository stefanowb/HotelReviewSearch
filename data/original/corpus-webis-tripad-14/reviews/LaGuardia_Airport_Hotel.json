We decided to venture downstairs for a drink at the bar, and were pleasantly surprised by really chatty and kind bar staff.

Yes, the TVs are old and the wireless Internet is a bit sluggish--but for me, those aren't deal-breakers (I didn't come to NYC to watch TV). For the price, I really don't think you can beat it. (If you want flat screen TV and all of the amenities, stay at the luxurious Ritz and spend $400+ a night.) Someone complained in a review that the hotel shuttle passed her up at the airport. Of course they did--they have to drop people off at the terminals before they circle back around and pick up newcomers! My experience with the shuttle was outstanding.
