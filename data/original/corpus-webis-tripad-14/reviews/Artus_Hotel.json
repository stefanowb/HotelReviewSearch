We booked the junior suite, since we needed the extra room for a crib for our 11-month-old. The size was adequate for the three of us with our bags and the crib (which the hotel provided). The balcony was a bonus; after the baby was asleep we could sit outside and breathe-in Paris. The bathroom was enormous, modern, beautifully clad in marble and squeaky clean. The staff were exceptionally helpful (thanks Patricia, Sanjay and all). The breakfast was very nice and the coffee outstanding.", "title": "Fantastic Hotel - Will Definitely Stay Again", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Cynthia H", "date": "October 5, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3995051}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Paris"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 13, "average": 31, "very good": 109, "terrible": 7, "excellent": 256}, "aka": "Artus Hotel Paris", "slim_ranking": 0.0680423870608, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Art and design enthusiasts will be right at home at the Artus Hotel.Situated in the very heart of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, Paris\u2019 centre for fashion and creation, this design hotel pays tribute to contemporary art.A stone\u2019s throw from the main tourist attractions, art galleries and antique shops, thishotel offers serenity in its modern decor and exceptional comfort."}
