The pictures in the website do not depict realty of the rooms. We were given one-room with a total of 5 beds in it. That's about all we had. It is old (tables, bed covers, paint, etc). The bathroom is narrow and you cannot even have two people shoulder to shoulder in it. Ocean-view rooms (are you kidding, we are right in the middle of town). Smells like smoke even when you are in a \"non-smoking\" room. The busy main street is right below the room we stayed so all the vehicle noise (buses, trucks & loud cars) can be heard through midnight and starts back up at 5 am. If we had known, we would have booked 2 rooms to accomodate family of 5 (3 adults, 1 child, 1 infant) nearby Sydney airport. Cost is outrageous for a 0.5 star hotel (0.5 for free transport to and from airport). Maybe the cost of transport is 75% of the AUD173 charged for a night.", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 15, 2005", "id": 3557644}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for one night only to cure jet lag following a flight from SFO.
