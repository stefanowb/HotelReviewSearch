The hotel was within 15 minutes transfer from the airport but we didn't see or hear an aircraft during the entire stay. The staff were thoughtful, friendly, helpful and cheerful and we would rate the whole service as 11/10. The food was excellent and well worth the cost. We read a few negitive comments before we went and we honestly don't know where they came from. If you are looking for a discreet, quiet, friendly, chill out place to stay to unwind and relax, this is the place to go. Know that it will be more expensive that your usual hotel and budget accordingly and you will enjoy the whole stay. Thank You Sheila, Lindsay, Alicia, Mati, John and all the staff at Biniarroca, we look forward to seeing you again very soon. Jon and Vicky - Room 8. PS.

We stayed two nights in a pretty room with a comfortable bed.situated on the ground floor; we also had an almost private terrace. Breakfast was good and all the staff we met very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was only open to residents, with a restricted menu which seemed aimed at the British palate. The lamb cultets were dry through being overcooked and covered in some sort of breadcrumbs - there was no jus , our nice head waiter did find some when asked. The boeuf bourguignonne (why in Spain?) was missing baby onions, bacon lardons and garlic! At over 30 euros for two courses, seriously overpriced and a disappointment.

For starters, the air conditioning in our room didn't work - we were told the first day someone was coming to fix it, but it appeared that the \"fix\" was unsuccessful because our room was hot. The staff ended up loaning us a fan, which was nice, but we would have preferred air conditioning, as promised (no one ever addressed this either, by the way). The room was also a little rickety - not spic and span, but really that of a country inn. So if that's your thing, it might not be an issue. For us, it was kind of an issue, particularly the um.... stained sheets that appeared on our bed the third night we were there (which I ended up changing myself, with the help of one of the waiters because the cleaning staff had left for the day. The waiter was very nice about it, but the fact I had to even raise the point that the sheets were stained and then change them myself was kind of adding insult to injury - especially for the price we were paying. And no one ever said a word to me about it afterwards, which I would have appreciated). Little country bugs abound, towels were a bit threadbare and we actually had to pay extra for beach towels (the sand created an issue with the washing machines or something).", "title": "Rural hotel oozing with charm", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TerenceS", "date": "May 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 106837165}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "So, all in all, although this was a nice experience, that's about all it was to US.
