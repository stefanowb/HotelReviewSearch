Its strongest attributes is its location in the keys, view from the units (assuming you have a waterfront view) and free internet (its small but very much appreciated). But the unit I stayed in definitely could have used a remodel. I've stayed in places that are truly a 5 out of 5 and this is not one of them.

There is a resteraunt that has opened unfortunately right down the road from the condo which will cause alot of traffic. I do not see them being open more than 2 years seeing that the location for a resteraunt is in a horrible desolate location surrounded by people that want a quiet vacation. Anyway the Hawks Nest has everything to do from renting their 2 fishing boats to pool, Jacuzzi, Pool Table, Ping Pong, Games, Books, and the condos are beautiful with very clean rooms and wonderful maid service.
