We were using Clancys as a base for visiting MacNean Bistro in Blacklion. We had tried to book a room in MacNean but it was booked out. I am glad that this was the case now, as we absolutely loved Clancys. The price of the rooms was very reasonable. Much cheaper than a hotel, and more homely too. Breakfast is served till noon, so there is no major hustle to get out of bed in the morning. The rooms were homely, and the staff so friendly, especially for the breakfast and the dinner service. The breakfast was a little on the dry side - rashers hard and sausages a bit small, but the staff more than made up for it. It says a lot when you are handed a newspaper by your server. We enjoyed MacNeans and were given a lift up and back by the owners of Clancys ! That was wonderful service. Another thing we loved was that Clancys was on the road to Sligo, close to Enniskillen, and very close to the Marble Arch Caves and Florencecourt Gardens. If you are staying in Clancys, you should head over to McHughs pub across the road, and make sure to head for the bar. The locals are a scream, and the beer is lovely.
