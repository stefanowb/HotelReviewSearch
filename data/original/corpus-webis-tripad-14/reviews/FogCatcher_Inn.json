Rooms are comfortably appointed and amenities include complimentary parking and a continental breakfast. Our Cambria, California, hotel is tailor-made for families, and several pet-friendly rooms are available. Corporate guests and groups find our hotel to be relaxing and rejuvenating and the outdoor pool and spa are idyllic locations to enjoy this part of the Central Coast. Guests of both the Fireside Inn and FogCatcher Inn are invited on the first Friday of each month to attend a wine tasting event featuring local wineries from the 46 West Wine Region. The tasting is held at the FogCatcher Inn along Moonstone Beach Drive. Located just footsteps from Cambria's beautiful Moonstone Beach, the FogCatcher Inn's resident rock-hound experts will carefully inspect treasures collected by kids after beach walks. Each afternoon this summer, poolside classes are offered in how to fold fun towel creations for fans of origami interested in going beyond paper! And the FogCatcher Inn offers families board games for family game nights, coloring books and crayons, puzzles, playing cards and cookies. The FogCatcher Inn welcomes family pets with special treats and VIP (Very-Important-Pet) status. Complimentary breakfasts and in-room refrigerators for guests' snacks and cold drinks combined with 15% savings for bookings at least 21 days in advance or for 3- or 4-night stays, make for great family vacation values."}
