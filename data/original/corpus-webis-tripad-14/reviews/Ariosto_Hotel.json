Quite good Peruvian dinners (although there are plenty of other choices in the area), outstanding breakfast buffet, and an interesting vibe, which is what drew me there in the first place -- it seems to be the #1 choice for professional visitors, from basketball teams to writers & jazz musicians. Which always makes for interesting conversations. And the staff speaks excellent English. Rooms were large if a little spartan, and while internet access was available, it seems to be more available in some rooms than in others -- it took quite a bit of wrangling for them to give me a cable.
