Formerly a convent this hotel has all the charm of a classic film of Spanish villages, with a courtyard that has a fountain in the center, a wagon filled with flowers to the side, and the tables of the outdoor dining bordering it. The room was very nice with a Talavera tiled bathroom that was worth a photo itself. I was lucky to have a room overlooking the main courtyard, with the spires of the churches over the wall, but the rooms all view one of the 3 courtyards. It was kept nice and clean also. The food was very good at the two restaurants I ate in and not really expensive. The staff were all very helpful and tried to take the time to be sure I was happy. Not much of a business center (2 pc's and a fax machine) although there are several conference rooms available. This is more of an hotel for romance in a romantic city, close to the Zocalo Park, Cathedrals and restaurants. One problem and it's partially my laziness. I asked the front desk to mail my stamped postcards instead of dropping them around the corner at the P.O. where I bought the stamps...6 weeks later and no one got their postcards.

The hotel is stunning, and in a great location, but the rooms are surprisingly small, and the service was horrible from start to finish. We booked a three-night stay through Orbitz, and requested a non-smoking room; on arrival, we signed the check-in form (which clearly indicated my NS preference), and were ushered to a small room smelling of stale smoke. When I called to ask if we could be moved, the receptionist --who seemed contemptuous of the fact that we had booked through Orbitz--told me that I had made a mistake, that she had no record of our having requested an NS room (despite the form I had just signed), and then hung up on me. When I called back and expressed my disappointment with the level of service, she retorted \"You are receiving good service, miss\". This kind of unacceptable service continued throughout our stay -- unwillingness to give us an extra pillow for a rock-hard bed, no chance of moving rooms, bar closing earlier than announced and then overcharging horrendously for room service (even the water in the room was 30 pesos for a miniature bottle), and finally, the hotel \"accidentally\" charged my credit card again for the stay, and \"miscalculated\" the amount of water and juice we had taken from the mini-bar. We opted to stay an extra night in Puebla, but high-tailed it over to the trusty NH, which was paradise in comparison.", "title": "Needs to get its act together", "user": "trilceana", "date": "August 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 18725436, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, bathroom", "disliked": "\u2014 Staff service"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with family", "text": "This is a place where you have to know what you are getting.

I don't have a problem with this in itself, but they convert to pesos at a artificial exchange rate that means that, in effect, you are not paying, say $135, but, rather, about $142. I know that the difference is small, but I find the whole thing very sneaky and unbecoming of a large hotel chain. You expect to pay a commission of some type when a hotel actually exchanges currency for you, but here all they are doing is quoting a price in dollars and not actually exchanging anything. If they want to quote a price in dollars, they should run it through in dollars, or in pesos at the official exchange rate. When you add on the cost to the guest of having the pesos charged on his credit card converted into U.S. dollars, the real cost per night iof a $135 quote is closer to $146.
