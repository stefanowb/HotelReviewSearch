From the outside the hotel doesn't look like anything great - but inside is very nice and they have done a good job keeping it up. The rooms have been renovated nicely (flat screens, comfortable beds), and it was very clean. Our only criticism was that it was the smallest bath ever! You can't stay any closer to BWI, although the area around there isn't great. Your best bet for dinner or an outing is to go to Arundel Mills by car (about 15 mins).

This is an older property but the remodel was great! The rooms have gold fixtures in the bath and flat screen TVs. The beds were comfy and everything was very clean. Very nice new decor. The layout of the entire hotel is less than desired. It seemed as though the hallways were designed as an afterthought. Somehow they messed up my reservation and they cancelled our room. My bad for not checking up behind them!!! If it were not for the unfortunate events that happened our first night I would have given it a better rating. There were 2 family reunions at the same time, which kept the hotel very busy. Granted, hotel security did a great job at handling it but there was severe overkill when the guard pulled a fire alarm at 2:00am when he thought he smelled cigar smoke coming from a room. Duuuh!! This evacuated the whole hotel and had old and young standing out in the parking lot in rollers and PJs. After the Fire Dept. left, 6 TSA Officers showed up and proceeded to throw out the person whose room it was. The next day, someone was smoking weed in their room (it could be smelled in the hall)and security went knocking on every door pretending to be housekeeping. When no one answered, they proceeded to open each door and see if they could smell anything. (Don't know how legal all this was!?!) They found the culprits called TSA and had them put out. I would definitely stay there again.

We switched to this hotel at the last minute because it was going to be extremely hot and they looked like they had a nice pool area. We were very pleased with our decision. The olypmic-sized pool was very clean and warm and there was an actual lifeguard on duty. As other reviewers mentioned, the staff is very pleasant and knowledgable about the area, with directions on hand to just about everywhere in Baltimore. We also used the convenient and prompt airport van service to catch the light rail system to the inner harbor--my boys thought this was quite an adventure. They even had a children's menu for room service, which I appreciated after a long day of sightseeing with two young boys. Like the other reviewers said, try the crab soup!

We only used the room for the day, but took a nap and a shower and can confirm that both the bed and the bathroom are more than you'd expect at this price. The room a/c unit was a bit noisy, which might be a problem at night, but it was definitely appreciated in the 100-degree heat! The free bottle of water is a nice touch. Otherwise, the staff were very friendly, the hotel pool looked like it belonged in a tropical resort. We didn't try the restaurant but the room service menu looked appealing. It was worth the cost to spend the day at the inner harbor, instead of in the airport waiting area.
