When we checked in to our room on Christmas (room 401) we asked the front desk clerk about the noise in the room because it was on a relatively lower floor. We were assured by the friendly staff person that it should not be a problem. Well it was. A huge problem. The music was so loud we could actually feel the bass reverberate in our bed. The next morning I complained to a front desk person (a different one) who assured me that the noise level was due to the Christmas partying and that it wouldn't be a problem normally. Well it was just as bad the next night. I complained to the manager in the morning who was very nice and promised to speak to the bar manager about lowering the music. Whether he did or didn't I don't know but the music was just as loud that night. I called the night manager who also was very nice and equally ineffective. The best she could do was offer me ear plugs. For $900 per night (holiday rates) I really don't think I should have to wear ear plugs to get to sleep before 2 AM. The hotel was lovely but after not sleeping well for four straight nights I would rather have stayed in a lesser hotel with a quieter bar scene.", "title": "Noise ruined our experience", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "starfski", "date": "December 29, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 12052233}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "NO make-up mirrors,no shower cap,the lock on the door which is battery operated breaks down all the time which makes it not safe,never got the breakfast order correct,did not get the room i reserved with king sized bed which i booked directly to the hotel,beach attendents were rude and one said \"if he had a gun i would kill all the birds on the beach\",otherwise the hotel is acceptable!!!!!!!!!!!!", "title": "Improvements Needed!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "chanel49", "date": "December 17, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 11628588, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 THE SHOWER HEAD", "disliked": "\u2014 THE LOCK TO THE ROOM NOT SAFE"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing", "text": "Just spent a weekend in Delano.

Well, I found service to be quite good. I didn't experience the foot massages at the pool (never saw this on any of the days there and spent lots of time by the pool) but in general, I found the staff very helpful. We also disliked the fact that we needed to come down fairly early to reserve good poolside loungers and I guess since I didn't tip the poolboy, I wasn't automatically given one. I was simply told it's first come, first served in the morning. Yet, the poolstaff were always cordial and helpful with basics. I found one of the ladies serving food and drinks to be a bit disinterested but again, maybe I simply didn't grease enough palms. The reception was also always very polite and generally helpful as was the concierge. I didn't really feel though that anyone went out of their way except for one individual. I was up very early the first day due to jet lag and the guy working the front desk at 4am gave me a weeklong pass for wireless LAN. I believe they charged for this otherwise so this was a very nice amenity as I know wLAN can be ridiculously expensive at US hotels. Further, I found the ground floor to be stylish and it offered a very nice \"air about the place\". I've been to many designer hotels though and it wasn't outstanding, just fairly nice. The beds in the room are also worth noting as they were very comfortable. I also found the room cleaning to be very good and the couple of times I asked maids for something, they were more than happy to oblige, be it additional towels, or whatever. One positive also worth mentioning is that I called ahead of time looking to speak with Ellis, the customer relations manager. He was no vacation and I spoke to Amanda who was super nice and without even trying, offered to upgrade out room to oceanview instead of cityview as we really wanted this. It was worth the effort as waking up in the morning to a beautiful sunrise added to the effect of being in Miami. Maybe this isn't a big deal, but it meant a lot to us in terms of what we were looking to get out of our vacation.

When we pulled up the building, like most in South Beach, looked really run down. However as soon as we pulled up the driveway my impression changed. While we were waiting to check in we were given cold lemonade. The lobby area and downstairs was interesting...very chic. Our room was different from any room I have ever stayed in. Everything was white, silver or mirrored, very modern. The bed was heavenly, wish we could have taken the comforter home with us. We had a nice view of the city and the room was quite large except the bathroom was pretty small. The pool area was ok, kinda reminded me of the Peninsula Hotel in Bev Hills with all the cabanas. The pool boys and servers were very attentive. Loved the person that came around and gave us free hand and foot massages! Food was outrageously expensive, but where isn't it expesnive in SB?
