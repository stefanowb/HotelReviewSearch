The parking was actually cheaper than I expected. Because I'm a member of their frequent traveler program they reduced the price to $10 per day for self-park. I was disappointed that breakfast wasn't included, so that was an extra $30 a day just for 2 people to eat at the buffet. The food was decent but overpriced. The location is good, about a 15 minute walk to Rodeo Drive. The beds are extremely comfortable and the wireless internet worked well enough. There were a few areas where I noticed that some improvements could be made, but nothing major. The pool looked very nice and clean, but we never had time to use it. The lounge chairs looked comfortable, and they hotel staff had placed towels on each one.

We arrived, a little after 3:00 pm and were told that our room was not ready. This is, of course, a little unnerving after travelling for about 7 hours, but understandable if the problem is taken care of quickly. We waited for over an hour before being let into our room, which was not even made up, to drop off our luggage. We decided, rather than sit in the hotel and wait for our room to be cleaned, we would go exploring. We came back to the hotel, several hours later and our rooms were finally cleaned. This was the only real complaint I had during our stay, but as I said it is a really big complaint. The best thing about this hotel are the beds. I have stayed in many Intercontinental hotels, most recently in Atlanta, and I must say they have the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. It is good to see that Intercontinental has made the commitment to upgrade the Crowne Plaza hotel range bedding as well, even if there was no feather-bed. The hotel decor is very much like a Holiday Inn, but this is considered a value hotel and no one should expect the Ritz when staying here. The continental breakfast, served in the mornings for Priority Club members, is a wonderful value and just the thing to start a busy day of exploring and shopping. Another hotel perk, so to speak, was the use of the 24 hour fitness gym about a 1/4 of a mile down the road from the hotel. The facility has workout machines, free weights, cardio machines as well as organized classes, which can all be accessed by Crowne Plaza guests for free. Now, as for the hotel's location, anyone coming to Los Angeles should understand, that no location in Los Angeles is ever entirely convenient. If you do not have a car it is very hard to move around the city. The Crowne Plaza is only a 15 minute walk to Rodeo Dr. and is right on Beverly, which has a number of restaurants and shops, all within walking distance of the hotel. If you can handle a tedious check-in, as we did, The Crowne Plaza is a reliable value-hotel option in Los Angeles, within reasonable driving distance to many attractions, and offers guests comfortable beds, complimentary fitness center privileges and a good continental breakfast.

There is a pleasant lounge with a full bar and comfortable sofas where one can sit, have a drink, order food, or simply read or work. The elevators could use replacing but they work. There isn't much to do in this area after dark; as far as I could tell, everything shuts down after dark. If you don't want to go to the parking garage, get your vehicle and drive somewhere to eat, you're pretty much stuck with the hotel restaurant and/or room service.
