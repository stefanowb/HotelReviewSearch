We had our adult children with us & booked this resort after reading previous good reviews. I did have a few reservations about it tho because of the distance from Luganville & isolation. However there was absolutely no need to worry about that. Grant the manager sat down with us every night to see what we wanted to do the next day & either took us or organised transport for us. Who wants to stay in Luganville anyway! The 2 blue holes were very close by & a must to see. We got a ride with a local (paid him quite generously) to the amazing Champagne Beach & Grant took us to a village one day. Grant also organised the diving trips for the divers in the group which were such an amazing experience.", "title": "Perfect family holiday", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "TaurangaKiwi", "date": "October 10, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 20789525}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The food was fantastic & well priced.
