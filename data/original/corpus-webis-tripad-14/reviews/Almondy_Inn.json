We needed a quick getaway. I wanted something elegant, with Jacuzzi and within walking distance to Thames (town center). The Almondy was a great choice. The innkeeper was exteremely friendly. He and his wife run the inn. He has worked in hospitality business (i.e. big chain hotels) for most of his life and it definately shows. The inn is new - it was rebuilt and it's been in oprations for only 1-2 yrs. There is hardly any wear and tear, it seems as if it was just open. The decor is amazing. Antiques, basic elegant colors throughout. Fireplace in the lobby. We had a smaller room with Jacuzzi, which was sufficent for us. Unfortuantely the guests who stayed there before closed the heating vents (?) and we were a little cold on the first night, but it was taken care off the next day.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "elakan", "date": "March 11, 2005", "id": 3266681}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Newport"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 20, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 174}, "aka": "Almondy Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.0392156862745, "description": "The Almondy Inn offers fine Newport Rhode Island lodging, complete with five beautiful and spacious guestrooms, elegant amenities, and a convenient downtown location in the Historic Hill district.
