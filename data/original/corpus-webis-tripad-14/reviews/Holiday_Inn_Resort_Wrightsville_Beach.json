The restaurant in the hotel was average hotel fare and we chose not to eat there which meant we had to drive for every meal. However, there was free wireless internete access, friendly service and clean rooms. There's a great outdoor pool and an indoor pool as well. The fitness center featured an elliptical trainer, two treadmills that weren't working an a recumbent bike along with a universal gym which was missing a few parts--not really suitable for someone serious about exercise.

Oceanfront pool and inside pool and a kiddie pool. We were two adults but noticed many nice features for kids, kids spree activities, popsicles during the day at the pool, that kept the kids happy. The walks along the beach to look for shells is great and the beach is wonderful for walking. If you don't want to leave the resort, you needd not. We did have several dinners at other Wrightsville Beach restaurants. There are plenty of dining and shopping choices very near the resort. The airport is a short fifteen to twenty minute drive from the resort too. While we were there, we looked at some of the other choices and were confident we had made the right decision for what you get. We like to look at value instaed of just the rates. For the location and amenities, we feel this is a great value. (especially if you are travelling with children). There is also a great sundeck overlooking the ocean, so if you want to catch some sun and not be by the pool...you have your privacy. Plenty of lounge chairs so you need not worry.
