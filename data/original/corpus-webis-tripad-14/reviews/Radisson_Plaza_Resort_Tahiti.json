After staying at the Intercontinental last time we were impressed by the Radisson. We were prepared for the bad service after all of the the scathing reviews, but I could not take the dreary rooms at the Intercontinental again. We were shocked to get very good service at the reception and restaurant. We stayed in much more expensive resorts on our trip, but got no better or worse service here. The room was small, but perfectly designed with a huge balconey and great view.
