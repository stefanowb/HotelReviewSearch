Interior of every room are different and The J bar is so artistically done that you cant miss to enjoy a drink in this bar. Quality of food in the restaurant is excellent too. we spent 6 nights here and were still craving for more. Location wise too this is nicely located, decently distant from the heart of the city and the fort. we checked out RAAS Haveli, Pal Haveli and Taj Hari Mahal but i think this resort is FAR better than all three of them. You may find service a bit slow but you cant crib whilst on a holiday after all they are not a business hotel. Staff needs little bit of grooming as most of them are hired locally.
