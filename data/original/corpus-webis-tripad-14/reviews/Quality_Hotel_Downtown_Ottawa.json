{"user_rating": 3.5, "review_count": 267, "name": "Quality Hotel Downtown Ottawa", "reviews": [{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Nice Hotel", "text": "I stayed here some time ago during a business trip to Ottawa. It is conveniently located near the center of the Canadian capital and has esy access to public transportation. You can walk to the Rideau malls in 5-10 min along the busy Rideau street, and the Parliament Hills and National Gallery are just steps away from the malls. A restaurant is right downstairs and I also went to the supermarket across the street for fruit and deli food. A bus stop is right at the street corner and the buses can take you to many nearby sights, or in my case, to a university 10 miles away. The room is clean and big, with a huge desk and a couch. Though it is a buget hotel I find it very comfortable and would like to stay here again.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "lizzylizzy", "date": "January 8, 2004", "id": 1543384}], "location": {"country": "Canada"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 27, "average": 67, "very good": 91, "terrible": 12, "excellent": 70}, "aka": "Quality Inn Ottawa", "slim_ranking": 0.537313432836, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.5, "location": 4.5}, "description": "When you stay at The Quality Hotel Downtown Ottawa you really have the best of everything - the convenience of a great location and outstanding value with comfortable and spotlessly clean guest rooms with brand new 32\" LCD flat screens As the closest hotel to the University of Ottawa campus, the Quality Hotel Downtown Ottawa is also just steps away from popular attractions such as the National Gallery, the ByWard Market, Parliament Hill, Rideau Canal and Rideau Centre shopping mall, and many other tourism hot spots to enhance your experience!"}
