The best thing was the 4 PM \"Country Fair\" with all sorts of freshly prepared local food served in the garden for free! After that you can do with a light dinner.

Within 2 days we were on first name terms from management down to cleaners and gardeners. All of the staff made us feel special, so much so that we were given a better room on the ground floor because the manager (Mr C) did not want us climbing 2 flights of stairs, offered complimentary dinner at the restaurant, and complimentary taxi to Da Nang airport for our onward travel! We explained to Mr C that we already had a taxi arranged and without hesitation he said then you must take a river cruise on the Thu Bon river for 2hrs instead! It was my wifes birthday while at the hotel and in the afternoon we were lazing around the pool when a member of staff arrived with a birthday cake. We have stayed at many hotels around the world but never have we been treated so royally as this. We did think at one point that the management may have confused us with someone else but no on speaking to several other guests they also had received similar treatment and also many guests are repeat customers. In conclusion We 100% recommend this hotel and also it is probably the best located in Hoi An.
