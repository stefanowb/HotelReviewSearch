We have always stayed at the Black Hawk Motel every one of those years. Brad, the son of the original owners, is just like family away from home. They keep the property and rooms in excellent condition. The cleaning staff is always polite and courteous and we never felt that we could not trust them in our rooms when we were not there. The cost of the room rental is extremely good since all you basically do is sleep there while visiting the water parks and the Dells area during the day. Their outdoor and indoor pool is always very clean. Parking outside your room is also a big advantage. Being a smoker and staying in a non smoking room is excellent because you can go right outside your door, sit on a chair and smoke and always come back into a nice smelling room. The location right off downtown Dells is always nice because you have that quiet, peaceful time without all the noise. Brad and his staff are wonderful people.", "user": "Kathleen Y", "date": "July 8, 2013", "id": 166774504}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great affordable hotel", "text": "We just got back from a four night stay at the Blackhawk.", "user": "Honeymooner514", "date": "July 8, 2013", "id": 166753748}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent stay!

It was perfect. The location was walking distance to downtown, which we walked to every night. I saw an entirely new side of the Dells by being able to walk downtown for night entertainment and dinners. The room was very clean, the bed was comfy, and the room was spacious. We were there over the fourth and were able to get chairs and lay out at the pool a few days. It was never overly crowded and all the other guests were very respectful. The porch was a nice touch, and having a parking spot right outside of our room was really convenient. The staff was also very friendly. Our room was right outside of the ice machine so we were nervous about noise, but even with that and the guests staying up late on the porch we were not bothered with any loud noise. I was very happy with this spot and so was my boyfriend, we can both be picky about being comfy and having a clean place when we travel and we were quite pleased with it.

That did not happen because of the holiday weekend everything was extremely expensive. I checked travel advisory and AAA this hotel had great reviews. We arrived late on the 4th of July to our surprise there was assigned parking directly in front of your door, no looking for a place to park A+. The staff was very friendly when we arrived they gave everything that was mention without us even asking for it? OMG, room 47 was extremely clean & big, it was directly across from the pool. We had a king size bed, the bathroom was up to date granite counter tops with mahogany cabinets to match. Granite top in room as well, flat screen TV & a small dinette set. The room did have a refrigerator and a microwave. The towels were soft, the bed was comfortable the pictures DOES NOT do this motel justice. It located 3 short blocks from downtown Super A+ there's a back street if you have to drive that will help you avoid the downtown traffic its to the left of the hotel if existing. A taste of New Orleans is only 3 short blocks from the motel great food. HERE'S a super plus after the guest checked out they actual wash the quilts and line dry them. That made my day. I walked around the room in white sock every night the bottom were still white. The bed sits on carpet the rest of the room is ceramic tile. This was our first trip to the Dells, the money I saved by staying at Black Hawk Motel we spent on nice dinners, and sight seeing.. The only downside was we drove in from Chicago MDW the toll were excessive and expensive the speed limit was 55 mph. There's a lot of road work in Chicago so the speed limit drop to 45 mph next time I will fly into MADISON WISCONSIN. One more + the lounge chair that sit I front of your room nice touch great for enjoying the evening breeze.
