The heritage area of downtown is a bit pricy but it is well worth it, it is so convenient and so different in style. The most convenient location in Downtown is the Queen\u2019s Road where there are number of heritage B&Bs and Inns like; Bluestone Inn, Abba Inn, Cantwel House B&B, Balmoral Inn and it is the Center of Downtown, walking distance to everything. We stayed in couple of those establishments, but Balmoral Inn is our favorite. It was the first establishment on Queen\u2019s Road, experienced staff and is olso very well maintained.
