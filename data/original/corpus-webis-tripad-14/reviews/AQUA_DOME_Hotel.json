It is a great hotel with a fabulous spa. The mere entrance tunnels are a work of art with blue lights or sparkly ones, giant artworks on the walks and calming therapeutic music. The outdoor pools are heated to a lovely warm temperature and are usuable all year. There are some rules on kids in the pool areas but generally they are allowed in almost all the pools and this makes a nice change from the non family friendly spas that seem to predominate.", "title": "Unusual but great hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "sjwoolnough", "date": "September 1, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8601520, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Spa", "disliked": "\u2014 Too busy"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Children are, however, not allowed in the Therme area where the steam and sauna rooms are.

The public are not allowed access to the spa/pools till 10am and after 10am things became uncomfortably busy. The kids water slide had queues so long it was pointless going on it other than between 9 and 10am. It just ruined the lovely facilities by letting in too many people.
