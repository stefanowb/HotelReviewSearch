We didn't eat here but we slept just fine. We did hear some noise from the maids a few times and some doors being slammed.

The Hotel was easy to get to from the CdGaule airport - where we had landed at 21.25. We took the RER almost right away, and followed the blue line (this trip cost us E8.20 (each, single). We were fortunate to meet a local who spoke French, so despite being told to get off the train at \"Chalet Les Halles\" we took up his reccommendation and went a stop further to \"SaintMichel/ Notre Dame\", where he said the change would be easier. The trip so far had taken about 30 minutes - therefore much quicker than bus, abd a lot less expensive than taxi alternatives. It turned out as he had suggested for the change over, and we were able to locate the yellow line (you can use the same ticket if you don't leave the underground) so we hopped aboard, disembarking at the \"Champ de Mars Tour Eiffel\".", "title": "Loved the hotel - friendly and clean", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Valtpal", "date": "December 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12009479, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness", "disliked": "\u2014 Can be difficult to find on foot"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I suppose beacuse our journey had proved uneventful, we decided to walk to the Eiffel Tower and then on to the Trocadero, (which we knew from our previous visit to Paris was litereally just accross the road.... our memories where right).
