The apts are huge (we had a Deluxe in the newer, elevator building), super clean, incredibly modern in furnishings, and amenities (free wifi, flat screens) and so on. Best tho was the staff. Had the privilege of meeting Immanuel, one of the owners, who was gracious, friendly, and very interested in our opinion of his property. After meeting him, it's understandable that all staff, from the front desk to the morning cook in the deli to housekeeping etc, everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome. I think it is an incredible value and should we ever return to Berlin, we'd only stay there. The neighborhood is great, always felt safe, the Ubahn is a 2 min walk, a grocery store and organic grocery are across the street, as is a pharmacy and nightclub too. 5 min walk to Alexanderplatz, wonderful shopping, open air markets and killer restaurants abound.

There were kitchen facilities that included a frig, microwave, toaster, kettle, coffee maker, and hot plate units. There is a small Italian restaurant in the lobby area, but we never got around to trying it out (smelled good, though). While the apartments are part of converted older buildings, they are quite quiet. Our unit looked out on an interior courtyard. No elevator, though, so practice your stair stepping with luggage!
