It was myself and my best friend on our girls' trip. I had never been out of the US so this trip was AMAZING to me!The staff was absolutely amazing and very welcoming. We wanted for nothing. The guys in the photo shop became our best friends (Kevin, Roan, and Teva). Our room was beautiful, simple but a classic room. We had a great view of the grounds and the Japanese steak house. The food was okay, they could stand to work on that. The american grill is probably where I ate most of my meals. Buffet breakfast was descent but lunch and dinner weren't so great. The bartenders were amazing! Shout out to the greatest lady ever.....Simone!!!! Also I must recognize Clayton and Fredereik. The pool areas were very nice, I spent the majority of my time at the bar pool. The beaches are well kept and raked every morning. Some complained about towel service, but anytime I needed a beach/pool towel, they were available. I was totally happy with this resort and i WILL be returning.", "title": "WONDERFUL!!!!!!!", "user": "Kimberlyn F", "date": "July 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166334724}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We had a wonderful time at the Jewel in Runaway Bay! We rented a car and drove about an hour from the airport in Montego to get there. Property is well-kept, beach is nice and our room was very clean. We had a mini-fridge in-room, a large bathroom with tall mirrors and spacious closet. Locking safe was large enough for a laptop. Staff was all very friendly and fun. Gift shop has t-shirts and souvenirs along with necessary items such as sunscreen and shaving razors. The kids (8 and 9) enjoyed the gameroom, with pool table, foosball, video games, and 'virgin' frozen drinks. Nice rooftop finess room with equipment. Food was delicious with a wide variety of dining options to choose from: always could find something that the kids would eat- we tried coconut pizza for the first time- it was yummy! The infinity pool is georgeous, complete with swim-up bar, and fresh beach towels. There was a lifeguard on duty at the pools and beach. Lots of drinks, and great coffee at Jaspers. Close to Ochos Rios, which has many things to do. We would definitely stay here again, 5 of 5 stars!", "title": "Great family vacation!!", "user": "gracieleee", "date": "July 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166198370}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My party had 5 people in it and we all agree that this resort was the worst any of the five of us has ever stayed at.", "title": "Beware: Don't go to this resort; They let locals use the facility on weekends, allow cruise ship day passes", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Cathy A", "date": "July 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 166159842}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we arrived at the resort, there was so much confusion, no one greeted us or told us where to go to check in.
