An hour ago (2 pm), I received a phone call telling me that they had to cancel my reservation because the large group that was currently staying there had decided they wanted to change their departure date and extend their reservation for the weekend. So, my reservation had to be cancelled ! This is less than 24 hours before I was supposed to be there. They had made a reservation at another hotel for me - a high rise hotel quite a distance from them where I have stayed several times before and have no desire to stay there again. There is a huge bike festival on in Montreal this weekend leaving a less than optimal choice of rooms in the city at the last minute. The Parc Suites person was apologetic and had found me another place to stay but I am still very upset about this as it makes a huge change to all of my well laid out plans for the weekend.
