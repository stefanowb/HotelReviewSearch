Service and amenities are minimal. Don't expect a smile unless you get the student relief receptionist. To get a drink you have to request that the bar be opened specially for you and it closes again as the bar person has to go back to the nearby Park Hotel. This was at 21:30 and there was no one around at all. To eat you go off site (recommended) or to the dismal, 60's look, Park hotel.", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Dexter48507", "date": "October 19, 2004", "id": 2757780}], "location": {"country": "Hungary", "region": "Central Transdanubia", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 1, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 0}, "aka": "Hotel Kastely And Park", "slim_ranking": 0.3}
