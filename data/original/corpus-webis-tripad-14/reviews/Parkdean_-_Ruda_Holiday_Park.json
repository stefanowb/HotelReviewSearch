They also had a small amusement arcade, and little soft play area, we made use of nearly all facilities on site, as the weather was total pants, rained every day.

We were served overpriced drinks in dirty glasses, sat on ripped and dirty chairs at dirty, unclean tables and listened to what can only be described as tired entertainment voiced on a terrible sound system.
