The hotel location, while near the London Eye, Downing Street (the other side of the Thames), there isn't much around the hotel itself. Check-in and check-out were icy. At first glance the room appeared tidy, however, the carpet was stained, bed sheets torn, the walls scuffed. In fact, had to request slippers as the floor was too dirty to remain barefoot. My room had absolutely no view. If you must stay here, book a room with a view of the Thames, otherwise your view will be of the hotel well or train tracks. Housekeeping never seemed to get it quite right with consistently late service. Tissue paper is apparently at a premium, having to request another roll (rather than being replenished with daily service). Phone did not work without interference, despite having it replaced. The TV was nice but required working knowledge of electrical engineering and if not on, the sole clock and the internet did not work. At least one elevator was always down, often having to wait 5 minutes or more. The restaurants were understaffed and, like the room, nothing special and disappointing. Not even a good cup of coffee, something I look forward to when in Europe. If I were not traveling for business (and compelled to stay there), there would be absolutely no reason I would stay at this hotel. While the hotel may look nice, the website pictures do not tell the whole (unfortunate) story. Annoyance after annoyance.
