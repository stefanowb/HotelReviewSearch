While we did not have a view, I didn't mind looking out into the jungle, since the property was maintained meticulously. We had a plunge pool (and outdoor shower), which was quite warm and I enjoyed sitting in it at the end of a day. I won't repeat the description of the rooms in detail that other people have posted, since I think they all have similar amenities, which are modern and luxurious. The bed was very comfortable and large, and it was great being able to plug our Ipod in and have music playing in the bedroom and bathroom. I also liked the refrigerator with free water, soda and beer all week. We watched a few movies on our large TV, and they have a selection of DVDs in the main office (no rental charge). They also have a small selection of used books and magazines in the main house in one of the side rooms, and I would suggest that they let guests know about this and perhaps suggest that people may wish to leave books they are finished with (we left ours). It would be nice if they subscribed to some magazines that people could borrow (just about all of the magazines I saw were foreign fashion magazines).", "title": "A Great Place to Relax", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "BeachbumsVirginia", "date": "February 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6766076, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The cleanliness of the room", "disliked": "\u2014 The fact that there is no bar or club."}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Room: We booked an ocean front room (Arbor) in the main house. Upon checking in, I looked out the doors, across the lawn, through some bushes, over the pool, through another set of bushes, and was able to glimpse the ocean - looking to the right of the outdoor massage station directly in front of our room. This to me, is not ocean view - the most important aspect of booking our room. In addition, the view from the bay window (along the side) looked out upon bushes and a chain-link fence that was attempting to cover the vacant lot next door.The rest of our room was large with a simple elegance. Bathroom was fine, nothing fancy, but the amenities were poor. Our room included a flat screen t.v. but we never turned it on and an IPOD stereo set up.

From the moment you arrive, the service is terrific. We were escorted to our room (one of the garden suites outside of the main house) and given a tour of the property. Our room was minimal but perfect - all decor white, extremely comfortable bed, beautiful bathtub - large enough for two (plus an outdoor cool tub and outdoor shower), flat panel tv, great ammenities like Molton Brown products and bug spray (thank you!). To be honest, my only complaint is that the shower (in its own room) has slats on the bottom allowing for a bit of a buggy problem. I have to say that I am terrified of bugs - a bit of a wimp admittedly, most people will not care at all.
