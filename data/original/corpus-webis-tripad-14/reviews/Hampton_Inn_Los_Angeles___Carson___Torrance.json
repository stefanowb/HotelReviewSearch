I'm a huge fan of Hampton Inns and this was a great experience, as always. The staff accomodated our late arrival and early departure. The bed was extremely comfortable, the room itself was quiet and clean. Because we are Hilton Diamond members, we were upgraded to a larger room that had a small sofa in it. Of course the location is not glamorous but it's conveniently located next to the freeways. We chose this particular location because we booked with Hilton points and it was far and away cheaper than any nearby property. The bathroom is small but we were only here for a short stay so it didn't matter. I would stay again if in the area and needed a comfortable accomodation.", "title": "Super Comfortable", "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "November 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 145486321}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled solo", "text": "This is an older Hampton Inn. Not only it is close to freeway, it is actually back to freeway with potential noise for some travelers. In and out of freeway is very, very convenient. It is a very good option if you are catching a flight at LAX and has a car. A bit far, but easy to get to the airport in 10-15 minutes without traffic. But be aware, gas stations might be difficult to find. There is only one, cash or ATM only, half mile away. The hotel itself is OK, old, but well maintained and clean. The best part of this hotel is people, great service and very helpful during my stay. Request a room facing the street to avoid noise issues.

I would fair a guess and say that the hotel has been updated recently.On both times, the rooms were small and the restroom is also small in comparison to the other Hamptons that I have stayed in. But it did have both a fridge and a microwave - which was great. The staff is friendly and in fact allowed me to check in a little early. The beds were comfy and clean as were the rooms.
