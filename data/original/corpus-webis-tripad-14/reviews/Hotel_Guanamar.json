There is no hot water, no 24 hour security, and no working pool. There were no stairs from our room to the lobby area after our first night ... they took these stairs down with electric saws at 6 am. We had to climb up a mud path to get to the lobby. The rooms are in no way decorated, and the \"satellite TV\" is a five channel postage stamp. The air condition unit has one level: extremely loud or off. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. They also charge you to use the safety deposit box. We did have a very nice cat hang out at our back porch, and the rooms were pretty clean. couple dead cockroaches and 5 or 6 millipedes running around- but that's costa rica. I wouldn't pay more than 40 bucks a night for this place- it has definitely seen better days.

First of all, it took us 1 whole hour to wait for them to give us our room. While waiting, a pigeon defecated on my shoulder! The hotel's lobby made of dried palms and wood was full of doves and pigeons! When we got to our room, all furniture was amazingly old, damaged and stained, the two 70's-style bathrooms had a huge tree trunk terribly inserted in the middle of the bathtub giving it a poor, disgusting sensation. Besides, the entrance to the rooms is gloomy, dark, empty! It seems you are in an abandoned house instead of a hotel! However, the worst part was that, after taking a shower in such awful conditions, we found a big centipede in the bathroom and a scorpion under the bed!!!! Of course, we asked the hotel to move us immediately to another room and they did so. The new room was not that terrible, at least a little bit newer, but nothing as expected.
