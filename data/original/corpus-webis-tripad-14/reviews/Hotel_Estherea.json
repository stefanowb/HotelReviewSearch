That said, try 'Bert's' on the corner for breakfast or lunch. Fast and cheap. As for the hotel, have been some changes in the last several years since we visited. All good. A new section in the back with its own (new) elevator is a big improvement. The hotel lobby, parlor and library are all clean, well maintained gathering places. There is a small niche bar just off the lobby. The restaurant has been expanded. Our internet rate, which was quite good, did not include breakfast which would have been an 18 euro add-on. See the comment about Bert's. Our room, in the new section, was very nice, well appointed, comfortable bed. The hotel is on the Singel Canal, just a short walk from the Dam, or really anywhere as the tram stop is in the next block. Employees all spoke excellent English (Dutch) and were most helpful.

Since we were only staying in town for a few nights we decided to splurge on the canal facing room because we wanted to wake up every morning and look out on the beautiful canal. We arrived at the hotel at around noon and were told that our room would be ready in an hour, so we stored our luggage and headed out for lunch. When we returned we were given a room, when we arrived in the room it was beautiful and I loved it, but when we looked out the window... no canal view... so we pulled up our reservation just to be sure that we ordered a canal view and sure enough we had so we headed downstairs to talk to the front desk. It turns out there was some sort of booking error and for some reason it said that we had booked a room for 3 and since they dont have any canal facing room for 3 they gave us an alternate room but the fact of the matter was that there were only two of us! So after looking through the reservation system for a while the woman at the front desk let us know that there was unfortunately no canal view room available! Bummer! However she was willing to upgrade us to their luxury suite AND offer us free breakfast AND free wifi for our entire stay! To be honest at first we were still a little upset, we really did want to have a canal facing room even if it was not the luxury suite but when we were shown into the luxury suite our opinion changed. The room was stunning! It was beautifully decorated with a giant chandelier in the middle of the room, I loved it and it was by far the best room that I have ever stayed in! The breakfast was really great, there were a ton of options and it really tasted great! The lobby and bar area are beautiful and great places to just hang out and get a drink. Overall the service made this hotel, they really worked hard to make things right for us! One morning we decided to bike to a windmill that we thought would be about a 20 or 30 minute bike ride away, luckily we checked with the front desk before heading out and she told us that it would probably take us 45 minutes to an hour each way and instead showed us the way to another windmill close by that is also a brewery! It was very cool! The location of this hotel is really amazing! There is a bike rental place orangebike like a block away where you can rent bikes by the day, so this hotel served as the perfect home base for us.
