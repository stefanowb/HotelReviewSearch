Finally it was our turn. We got charged an extra hidden fee of $9 a night per room for their \"resort fee\". We took our stuff up to the rooms and left for dinner & Disney parks. The rooms have absolutely NO extras- No microwave, fridge, anything. (This is 2010, people, keep up with the times..) When we returned a little after midnight the room was hot and stuffy. The air conditioner wasn't working. We had to leave the balcony door open. The next day while trying to blow-dry my hair the plug would not stay in ANY of the outlets, it fell right out. I had to hold it in with my brush while drying my hair. We were gone all day and night and once again came back to a hot and stuffy room. The next day, after taking a luke warm-cold shower, I was blow-drying my hair.. the breaker shut off. I had to go into family's room next to us to finish.. The breaker went off in there after about 4 minutes. We left for the whole day. When we got back for the night we decided to go to the hotel dining room and eat dinner. It was 9:30, the kitchen didn't close until 10:00. After being ignored for 10 minutes, the waitress came to take our order.. \"What can I get you to eat, I need to hurry the Kitchen closes soon...\" We disregarded her rudeness and ordered our food. Trying to be polite to her \"needing to hurry\", my husband decided to order dessert with our meal. \"We dont really have a dessert menu, we have ice cream..\" as she walked away. We asked a different waitress and she listed all sorts of desserts they had. Our waitress was then mad and slamming things around. My husband and I went to the front desk, told the \"supervisor\" the issue and she wasn't really helpful or concerned. We then left and walked to Friday's and ate there. Coming back to the hotel around 1230am, our key was deactivated. (This same thing happened in my sister's room the next day.) I really recommend NOT choosing this hotel. Customer service is awful.

All of the waiters and bartenders have been very nice to us. The buses that run to all of the Disney parks are less crowded and easier to travel on than the ones when we have stayed at Disney resorts. Everything was nice and clean.
