It was a quick walk from there to the Residence Inn. A bit hard to locate at first, I found it to be an ideal location as the week went on. Room 719 had a nice view of the water and I was happy to see the windows opened a bit to let fresh air in. Breakfasts were complete, and convenient. We paid $229/night which was fair. The gym was a bit small, I tried to jog outside but got a bit lost. The treadmills had small tv's to watch but there were only 2, and 2 stationary bikes and one eliptical trainer in this small gym. One treadmill seemed broken. Rooms were clean, and spacious. Even tho just my husband and I were in the rooms it was nice to be able to close the bedroom door and sleep while he watched late night tv. Housekeeping did a nice job of cleaning every day. It was a short walk to the north end, lots of great Italian restaurants, Mikes pastry, and the \"t\" station was right next to the Gardens where hockey and basketball are played. We got last minute Red Sox tickets on stubhub and took the \"t\" to the game. Easy to get around by walking or on the \"t\". Bunker Hill monument within walking distance, and a red marking, just outside the hotel makes it easy to follow the Freedom Trail. Our flight didnt depart until 4pm so we got a late checkout at 1 and stashed our luggage at the front desk without problems until it was time to take the \"t\" to the airport. I would stay here again if I returned to Boston. There was a small pool and spa, but I'm not crazy about getting into a tub of warm chlorine so I didnt use them.", "title": "Ideal location, great stay in Boston", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "alacraft", "date": "October 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 46481701}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled on business", "text": "While this hotel didn't have many buzzes and whistles, it was clean, the rooms were nice, and the staff was very friendly.", "title": "Clean, pleasant hotel, with a friendly staff.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "whitegown9", "date": "October 9, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 46389637}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I did have room service while I was there as well, and while the selection was limited, the food was delicious and delivered incredibly quickly.", "title": "Very nice stay!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "DRD", "date": "October 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 46202028}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "I really have no complaints about this hotel.", "title": "Too much money for the location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Corn&Beans", "date": "September 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 39713891}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Great place- fantastic views, nice pool, a short stroll to Bunker Hill, 15 minute drive into Cambridge, just across the bridge from the Italian district.

We had a room with 2 queen beds which was plenty big for us and the bedroom was closed off from the living area which meant when the kids went to bed, we could still stay up and hang out (and they could slip out into the living room in the AM to watch TV and not wake us up right away). The hotel had a great breakfast every morning--scrambled eggs, taco shells, potatoes, cheese, french toast, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, etc. The indoor pool was small but just fine for our 2 kids every morning and no one besides us ever seemed to use it. We were able to park for free in a small \"lot\" right behind the hotel--we were told by the staff that we were parking at our own risk and were warned of a recent break-in back there but it's an extremely well-lit area, visible from the hotel rooms and we had no problems leaving our car there for the 5 days we were there. The location is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest T station (North Station) and getting around Boston was very easy from this stop. The water taxi was also only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and took us right over to the aquarium. It's also about a 10 minute walk to the North End which made for lots of great Italian dinners and pastries. Oh, and there's a small playground area in Paul Revere Park which is across the highway from the hotel and on the way to the T station. It's a pretty scenic location too, located right on the Freedom Trail and the wharf with some really nice views of boats and a very cool bridge that is lit up at night which the kids really liked. All in all, we were very happy with our stay, although it was a little pricier than we usually spend on a hotel. But...I guess considering we were all able to comfortably live within one room, our breakfast was included, we had a pool available, and we ended up not having to pay the $30+/night parking fees, it all worked out okay!", "title": "great for family vacation", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "littlegrrl", "date": "August 27, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8514471, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 free breakfast, size of suite, good location to T station"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "This is a clean pleasant hotel in a great location for tourists.

The room looked over the busy Charlestown Bridge. I'm glad it wasnt summer, as I would have wanted to open the window and there was no way you could because of the noise of the traffic. We tried breakfast only once, but all the hot buffet items were already cold and it was only 6:30am (jet lag!), however, we were able to toast bagels so all was not lost. My real bug bear was that we went out one day and came back at 3pm to find our door propped open. We just walked as anyone could have. There were a couple of other rooms with their doors also propped open. When I rang reception they apologised and said it must have been housekeeping. I couldn't help feeling a bit suspicious, and left the door sign on saying No Service for the rest of our stay.
