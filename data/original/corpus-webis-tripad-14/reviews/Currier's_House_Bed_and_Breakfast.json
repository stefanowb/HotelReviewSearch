We had a wonderful time. We got there early evening. Nancy was there to greet us and get us settled into our room. We stayed in the \"Sunny Room\", which was the largest of the 3. It has a comfortable queen bed and a private bath. The room is bright, has nice antiques and gorgeous original floors. Once we upnpacked, we went for a short walk down the back of her street. Very quiet and peaceful.", "title": "Very Charming B&B", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "L1", "date": "May 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5143753}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Jaffrey"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 5, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 9}, "slim_ranking": 0.5}
