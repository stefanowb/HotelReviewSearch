The room was spotlessly clean, quaint, and pretty, with a modern bathroom and gorgeous views of the countryside surrounding Toledo. At night, you can see the entire cathedral from the hotel, lit up. It is mesmerizing. Quality to price ratio was excellent. The staff was quite friendly and accommodating.", "user": "PT1976", "date": "April 10, 2009", "id": 27742626}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great hotel, bad restaurant service.", "text": "Located in the Los Cigarrales hills surrounding Toledo, this place is perfectly located for families and travellers with cars. It's quiet and peaceful and a nice escape from the busy city below. If the busy city is what you came for, and you don't have a car, I would not stay here. It's a pain in the neck to get here using public transportation, which runs only hourly. We got to Toledo at 8 PM and there was no information at the train station regarding which bus we could take, so we ended up taking a bus to the Plaza Zocodover to see if we could catch the 7.1 bus to the hotel from there. It took us a good ten minutes to find the bus station, wand once we did, the hourly bus zoomed by us, meaning we'd have to wait another hour and pay another 2 euros, since they don't do transfers here. We ended up taking a 7 euro cab ride to the hotel, dumped our stuff, and then took another 7 euro cab ride so we could enjoy Toledo at night. So, add 14 euros to the hotel price and it doesn't seem like quite a bargain. The cab ride however, was a beautiful way to see the area surrounding the Rio Tajo. Because we were only staying one night, and needed to store our bags while we explored Toledo, we couldn't leave them at the hotel because that would entail another 7 euro cab ride - s we ended up taking the bus to the bus station, renting a locker for our bags, and then explored the town. So it's doable if you don't have a car, but not very enjoyable.", "user": "cudafamily", "date": "March 30, 2009", "id": 27079925}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Beautiful View", "text": "Our family of 6/ 2 triples stayed 2 nights.
