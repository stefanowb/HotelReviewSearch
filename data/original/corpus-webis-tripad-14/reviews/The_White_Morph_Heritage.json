Breakfast is next door at a cafe (busy but not slow). The restaurant at the White Morph is excellent - make your dinner reservations early. On the other hand, ask yourself if you really want to go to this town. The day we were there the whales, for which it is famous, were in short supply. Comfortable beds and nice large rooms. Across the street from the beach, so there is a nice walk along the ocean. Staff was very helpful with getting from hotel to whale watch, calling taxi, etc. This hotel is not walking distance from the train station, so if you are coming by train arrange for the taxi/shuttle to meet you at the train.", "title": "If you want to go to Kakoura this is a good choice", "user": "Ready2Go2008", "date": "December 19, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 121902357}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Have stayed here twice now and cannot fault either time.

The Inn also has a restaurant that served great food tho the crayfish were rather expensive. There are lots of other good restaurants within walking distance.
