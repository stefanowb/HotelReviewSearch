It is breakfast, but I wouldn't call it particularly delicious by any means; rather fuel for the morning. Now for the bad. The furniture was rather worn in the room, particularly the coffee table; really could use replacing. And finally, the parking was horrible. Although we were able to park each night in the garage, for which you pay and that's ok, the spaces were terribly small.

All four tracks are busy throughout the day, and night. I should have known something was wrong when I arrived in my room and there were two pairs of ear plugs on the nightstand. If I would have used them, it would have not been enough. The trains are LOUD!!! You would think that the trains and noise would slow down late at night, but no. The trains come by every 10 or 15 minutes until about midnight and then arrive every 30 minutes until 6:00 am when they increase in frequency. The ringing barricades for the streets can be heard with every train. The guys driving the trains must delight in sounding the horns as much as possible. I paid $131 for one night and checked out as soon as possible the next morning. I checked in to the Hilton Resort at Torey Pines, about 20 minutes away and it was one of the nicest properties I have stayed at, and it was the same rate at $131.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "quiglyupover", "date": "October 2, 2007", "id": 10033170}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "First the good parts.
