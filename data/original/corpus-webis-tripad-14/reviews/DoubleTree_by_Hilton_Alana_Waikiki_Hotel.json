As with a lot of hotels in Waikiki, there is only valet parking available, which is $19 a day. It's about a 5 to 10 minute walk to Waikiki Beach via the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which wasn't really an issue for us because that was not the reason for our trip to Honolulu. The front desk staff were quite nice, and we were given a room that is the closest to having an ocean view. The room (1219) its self was adequate, nothing spectacular and one of the smallest rooms on the floor, with a lanai, comfortable king bed, and desk, but oddly no other table or chairs.
