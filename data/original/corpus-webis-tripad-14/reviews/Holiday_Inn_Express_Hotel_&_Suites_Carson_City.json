Fortunately, we did not have one negative experience and were quite pleased to have found a new, modern accommodation in a town filled with old, seedy ones. We did not make advanced registrations; rather, after driving around Carson City early Thursday morning and rejecting six motels/hotels on sight, we walked into Holiday Inn Express and immediately received a room with two Queen beds for three adults. The price, with tax was $98.01. A continental breakfast included eggs, cereals, bagels, toast, hot cinnamon buns, juices, fruit, etc. There was more than enough for anyone to choose from. An attendant kept everything stocked and the area clean. We stayed on an upper floor that faced the major route going north to Reno. If you do book a room here, ask for one facing the back lot. Although the scenery of the mountains was great, hearing the trucks roaring by all night was a little disturbing. Other than that, our counter service was excellent, efficient, and most pleasing.
