We stayed there for 8 days and genuinely enjoyed our visit. Yes, the hotel rated 2-star and the rooms are small. However, we had just completed a cruise ship journey to Norway (round-trip from England), so the room did not seem all that tiny. Our room was on the first floor with a window looking out at the courtyard. The room was clean and serviced every day with fresh towels. And yes, you can see the Eiffel tower from the street right outside the hotel entrance. We took a photo of the street and hotel front from the Eiffel Tower. Of course, as other reviews have noted, the hotel is located very accessible to just about everything you might plan to do during a visit to Paris. The Eiffel Tower was a short walk away, and we visited there often; particularly in the evening to observe the twinkling tower each hour. We arrived in Paris via the Eurostar Train from London. The taxi ride from Gare du Nord was about 12 Euros. The hotel is near metro and train stations. We booked a 3-day pass on the L'Open Tour Bus (unlimited on/off protocol at 50 Paris locations) which could be quickly boarded at the Eiffel Tower or near Les Invalides. This allowed us a wide range of options, including unrestricted boat rides (not available on the 1- or 2-day tickets) on the Seine (the Batobus shuttle boat). This allowed us to see just about every part of the heart of Paris at our own schedule. We were at the hotel during the Bastille Day National Holiday celebrations and were able to enjoy the events at the Eiffel Tower area. We loved the nearby restaurants and occasionally purchased snack items from nearby convenience stores (usually for ham and cheese sandwiches) and a delightful bottle of French Champagne. There is an abundance of nearby cafe's, most with very enjoyable and comfortable sidewalk tables that are full of tourists and local folks. The hotel booked a Yellow Van (only $36) for the two of us to fly out from De Gaulle Airport. We met several of the staff members during our 8-day stay and every one we met was very helpful and friendly, and spoke English.
