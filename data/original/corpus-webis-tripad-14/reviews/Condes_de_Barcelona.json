That's when we discovered that you actually only get 1 hour per day of access in the lobby. If you want internet in your room, they charge an outrageous amount per 24 hour period. We went to talk to the front desk - waited a full half hour, got what we thought was a Manager, who 'checked our story' on the website while we waited - only to see for herself that there is no mention of internet service surcharges. She had to ask her Manager and would call us in 10 minutes. An hour later, we went to find her Manager - got a 'Front Desk Manager' who argued the fine points and the fact that not all hotels say they surcharge for internet access, but many actually do charge. He wouldn't give in, so we asked to speak to the Manager (so many managers and yet such poor service). He couldn't accommodate us, but said we should ask him at the end of the day what their decision was. Ultimately, the 'best offer' was half price for internet access, which we took because we needed it.
