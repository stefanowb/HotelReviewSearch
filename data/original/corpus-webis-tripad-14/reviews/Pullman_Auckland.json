There were no free parks left, so after 5 mins of driving around I went to leave only to find I was being charged for the pleasure of just driving in. Unable to contact the carparking company, I went and spoke to the hotel. These guys were incredibly helpful, and arranged for my car to be park, and validated my parking ticket for me. All i wanted was to get out of the carpark, so this service was totally above and beyond what i was expecting. When I went to leave, one of the concierge escorted me to my car, and opened the door for me. Huge thanks to the staff there, next time I need a hotel in Auckland I will definitely come to you.

I know what i like and and i'm not shy of making my thoughts known if i don't get it. But i could not fault my recent stay at The Pullman hotel in Auckland. From the very efficient & cheerful concierge who opened my taxi door and then promised to have my bags in my room before i get there, to the charming and friendly front desk staff who made me feel like i was returning home after a long trip, it was perfection. I loved the lobby, Very attractive use of colour and stylish furniture & fixtures, without being tacky or ostentatious. My check in was fast and i was certain that i would reach my room before my bags, and i was already planning a \"you were saying..?\" to the concierge that was almost certainly in another lift on his way up with my luggage. I was in room 1408 on the top floor. I opened the door and was immediately surprised by the size of the room. Large and well appointed with a guest bathroom near the door, and all the comforts that you would expect in a 5 star property. Coffee is an essential item for me. I NEED it as soon as i wake and also throughout the afternoon if im working in my room, so it was with delight i see a top of the range Nespresso machine on the desk with a supply of pods. Nice touch. The king size bed looked very inviting and i was glad the Pullman has not adopted the annoying practice of having 45 pillows and cushions on the bed that some hotels in Europe i have recently stayed in, Ipod dock in the room was great for charging and playing my tunes while i unpacked (nice quality sound by the way, but i cant recall the brand of the dock).", "title": "Always Great !", "user": "Costanza1975", "date": "July 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 170058862}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed here on business.", "title": "Good for business or leisure", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dropandflop", "date": "July 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 169238821}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Check in was fast and efficient except my loyalty number dropped from the booking and was never able to get it added by the hotel.", "title": "Friendly staff, great views!!", "user": "Sandra310", "date": "July 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 169221294}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled on business", "text": "The room was clean and comfortable.
