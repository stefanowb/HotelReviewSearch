I found that the Hotel Finisterra was a nice place for those visiting Cabo for the first time. It is very close to downtown (within walking distance) and very close to the Marina should you do any water activities. I booked a standard room and it was HUGE almost bigger than my own apartment. It had a nice view of the pool and the ocean. It also had a nice balcony. I found the hotel to be quiet and the staff to be reasonably nice. A word to the wise, buy your own water at a store downtown because the bottled water is very expensive at the hotel. Their tap water is purified but it still tastes a little funny. I liked that they had huge pools and a choice of pools for those who really wanted to swim, lounge, or play volleyball with the kids. They also have nice hammocks on the beach. What I did not like was that even though you had access to the beach and it was pretty, there was no swimming cause the water is too dangerous. Also in the lobby near the concierge, there is a desk with a representative for a time share. This person WOULD NOT LEAVE ME ALONE!! I found myself trying to use different exits to avoid them harrassing me to go on their \"free breakfast\". They make it sound like the deal of the century but TRUST ME, do not do it. IT WILL SUCK UP AN ENTIRE DAY AND RUIN PART OF YOUR TRIP!! Also the hotel is about 40 min to 90 min from the airport depending on transportation. PLEASE AVOID THE TIME SHARE AGENTS AT THE AIRPORT PROMISING YOU MONEY BACK AND A FREE SHUTTLE IF YOU GO TO THE PRESENTATION. THESE MEN WERE AGGRESSIVE, SCARY, AND SHOULD BE KICKED OUT OF THE AIRPORT. THEY ARE ESPECIALLY AGGRESSIVE WITH FEMALE TRAVELERS SO BEWARE. JUST KEEP SAYING NO AND WALK AWAY. TAKE THE SHUTTLE AND PAY 15 OR TAKE A CAB AND PAY $60, JUST STAY AWAY FROM THESE AGENTS, THEY ARE HORRIBLE AND A LITTLE SCARY. Other than that it is a decent hotel. I wouldn't stay there again just because I want to be able to swim on the beach where I stay but if you are into pools, you can stay there.", "title": "Nice for First Timers to Cabo but Beware", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "aroseofagal", "date": "August 1, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "business": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 18508315, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The Pool", "disliked": "\u2014 The Horrible Time Share Representative in the lobby"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "After reading a majority of pleasant reviews there were a few negative ones as well; which made me a little nervous but we got a great deal for this place on our anniversary so we went for it.", "title": "Nice, clean hotel in a prime spot", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "kris444", "date": "July 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 18458998}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Hotel: I must say that my boyfriend and I only have nice things to say about this hotel.
