It has just got better every year. Our room was kept spotlessly clean and there was always clean towels daily. The food was excellent in the World Cafe and in all the other restaurants also. Where else can you go and eat steaks every night? My only complaint if you could call it that was that sometimes the service was not as good this year. There seemed to be fewer waiters than we remembered from other years. Still we were on holiday so not rushing off anywhere. Entertainment from Picasso and his team who all work so hard was as enjoyable as ever. Beach seemed a bit crowded this year but plenty of room at the pools.

I quite like the fact that the sand is firm so you can walk easily. There had been a tropical storm close by and so the sea was quite murky for a few days but after this the sea became very clear and was great for snorkeling as there was some nice fish around the rocks about 200m off shore which were easy to swim to. I used, the Catarmarans as often as I could BUT BEWARE, what breeze there was, was going off shore (which the guys running the Aquatic Centre said was the norm) and so as you came back in towards shore, about 50m out the wind just drops because of the palm trees etc sheltering the beach which makes it VERY hard to make that last 50m. On strong wind days no problems. It took me 45 mins to cover that last 50m one day and that was with giving up trying to catch any wind and eventually getting off the catermeran and swimming/towing it to shore. Not the end of the world though and added to the fun of the holiday. The Germans waiting to use the Catermeran next though were not amused that I had used up 30 minutes of their allotted time \u2013 still, if they were that bothered they could have swam out and helped me pull it in.

We really enjoyed the covered walkways between buildings that allowed us to stay dry while walking from our room to the restaurants and bars.

The gold towels are a little cheesy around the resort but they do enforce the rule that only preferred guests can stay around the preferred pool. The bar palapa is nicely located beside the pool and includes large washroom facilities. There are three thatched palapas that keep out the rain even on windy occasions, but the light fabric covering the other loungers only wards off the sun, not the rain. The booze at the preferred bar is top shelf and I noticed that they keep the more expensive booze in the cupboards down below. I saw an English guy order Johnnie Walker Black with coke and the bartender did not blink an eye. 151 proof rum is available and I enjoyed raspberry flavoured Smirnoff and Bacardi Limon Rum. We did not notice any watered down drinks and if anything, we felt the drinks were too strong. Bar service around the pool is hit and miss, and our regular tipping did not seem to keep her coming back on a regular basis. The natural flow of drinks through the body allowed me plenty of opportunity to refresh my drink while I visited the facilities. The free Wi-Fi has adequate speed for our laptop but you have to go through a process to get access. At the coffee shop is an internet guy who will give you a 10 hour prepaid ticket that gives you a log in name and password. You get a voucher from the preferred lounge staff to take to the internet guy. If you run out in the morning or late at night, you have to wait for the guy to show up around 9 to 10am before you can get a new prepaid ticket for another 10 hour limit.

EVerything went smoothy the entire week. Two guys offered to help with our luggage and they whisked us right to the Apple check-in where they got the number of our van and escorted us directly to our bus. Well worth their tip!!! Traveling through Apple was great! They had recently started non-stop shuttle service to Dreams LaRomana so no stopping at 100 hotels to drop guests off along the way. The drive is rather long (90 min or so) and if you are prone to car sickness, a difficult ride. (The time will be cut in half when the new road is done but they said that will take about 2 years). Upon arrival at DReams we were taken to our building for check-in rather than checking in in the lobby - another perk of traveling through Apple. We were given champagne and cool cloths and check-in was efficient. Our rooms were clean and beautiful. Bedding was nice and beds were very comfortable. We ordered different pillows the 2nd night from the pillow menu - perfect! The grounds are clean and beautiful. The pools are amazing! The beach is clean and gorgeous. Beautiful sunsets!! We thought about upgrading to Preferred but didn't want to spend the extra money. We didn't need to. The resort is laid out beautifully and we were close to everything.
