Overall, most people who ate at the hotel complained that the food was rather bland and only ever warm, so my tip would be if you have to eat here - try and eat what is being cooked in front of you at the Grill, that way it is guaranteed to be hot. The drinks were fine, if you wanted branded drinks you had to pay approx \u20ac2.20 for a branded liquor with a mixer. Entertainment was Spanish orientated as most of the cliental was elderly Spanish. We never had a problem with this as most nights we ate out, but on the whole, we found most people at the hotel to be friendly. We never used the pool, but it looked clean enough and there was plenty of sun beds although you had to go downstairs for your drink.
