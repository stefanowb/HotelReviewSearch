In general, it was a standard Embassy Suites experience -- that is to say, a fairly good experience -- with the exception of the air-handling problem mentioned in the previous review. It seems the hotel's entire air-handling system is switched either to cooling or heating (which in itself is not odd), but if the hotel's system is set one way, you cannot achieve the opposite effect in your room no matter how you set the room's thermostat. Thus, we found our rooms uncomfortably warm but could cool them only by opening the sliding glass doors to the outside. Otherwise, it was a good stay.

We went to our room, third floor , in a glass elevator...loved the view of the Atrium and the Koi pond. Beautiful decor. Large painted mural on the wall. Our room was ready, the hotel let us have an early check in, very nice. the room was clean, big pillow top bed. some noise from the air-conditioner and the channels on the TV were fuzzy. But the view of the pool was great. Coffee maker, coffee, sugar , creamer, tea all waiting. A bottle of water too...for $4.00, but it was a big bottle. Lots of clean towels. We went downstairs for the morning complimentary breakfast..wow...it was fantastic. Best I've ever seen. made to order and everything you could ask for. Fruit, muffins, bagels, yogurt, plenty of anything you could want. We ate our breakfast in the Atrium watching the Koi in the pond...a turtle or two swam by . I loved it. Later on , the desk clerks told us we could invite our family to come over and swim in the pool...as we did, and all had a blast. Plenty of clean towels there too. And a jacuzzi.
