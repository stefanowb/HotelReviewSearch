The rooms (104 & 105) were spacious, while room 105 had a temporary sea view (when the vacant plot opposite is built upon - which could be months or years away, who knows - the sea view will be gone). Everything was very clean. The hotel was in a good central position for visiting sites such as the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya and Topkapi and it was a wonderful area for pottering around. The only thing which I think it fair to add is that the noise of the train (which appears to stop running between about midnight and 5am) is a little disturbing, but apparently this is scheduled to be made redundant any time now.
