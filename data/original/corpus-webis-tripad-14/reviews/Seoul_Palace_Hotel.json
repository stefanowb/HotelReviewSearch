Asiarooms had the best rate that I could find anywhere. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They have 3 computers in the lobby for free internet access. The hotel is located in Kangnam, which is a very upper-scale neighborhood. Within walking distance is the Kangnam bus terminal, which is a major stop for all buses and subway. Co-located with Kangnam terminal is the Shinsegae dept. store and the lower subway tunnels have tons of food and shops. Find your way to the subway entrance area and there is a restaurant called Myungin Mandoo. It's really cheap and they have really good mandoo (dumplings) and ddukboki. 3 of us ate and walked out for under $12 dollars. Among all the shops, there is a floor level dedicated (outside of Shinsegae dept. store) to making curtains, bedsheets and blanket covers. It's just a fun place to walk around and people-see.", "title": "Good 3 star hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "pechung", "date": "January 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 12280640, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Value", "disliked": "\u2014 Not in the middle of food and stores.

In fact, it's the first hotel stop from the airport. The bad part is that it's the first pickup stop when going TO the airport and therefore, you must ride along for the next 5 hotel pick up stops. This adds an additional 45 minutes to your return trip back to the airport. One hour from ICN to the hotel and 1:45 from hotel to ICN. If you're flying KAL into Korea, buy your KAL limo passes on the airplane. It's about $4 cheaper per roundtrip ticket than if you buy it at the airport upon landing. Overall, I was very satisfied with the hotel. If staying in Kangnam area again, I would stay there. Of course, you can't beat Lotte hotel for location and service, but that's a few hundred dollars more, too.", "title": "Great Service", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Notimpossible", "date": "June 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7780098, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness of facilities and room", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of English instructions for bidet"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Seoul Palace Hotel for six nights.
