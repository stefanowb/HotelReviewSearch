We thought, to our dismay, that we were in for a great stay. That is, until the furnace in our McKenzie house went out. The owner Bruce was out of town due to his father's passing. We understood that, but Bruce is not the maintenance man-and he did not have one!! You would think that a multi unit establishment would have someone available to do repairs. There was NO ONE AROUND to fix the furnace!! There was a fireplace but NO WOOD AROUND! The only person we had to call was a very friendly lady named Danita who was taking care of things as best as she could. She recruited one of the other tenants-someone actually staying there as a guest-to try to repair the furnace. All the while, my husband, who was sick, and my two kids were freezing. The kind lady tried bringing us space heaters, but the fusebox kept blowing from too much load. The lady in charge kept trying to call Bruce to ask him what to do about the furnace, but he never returned her phone calls, she left him many messages!! Doesn't it make sense to you intelligent people out there that a business owner would make himself available for property issues even if he is away? After two days we finally were so fed up we had to leave, and on top of everything else, we never received a refund for balance owed to us. In my opinion, not only is Bruce a horrible property manager, but a dishonest one as well.", "title": "freezing our butts off, broken heat, no maintenance man", "user": "frequentraveler1234", "date": "July 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 17823157, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 leaving", "disliked": "\u2014 hypothermia"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "1.

All in all the rooms, the people, and the food are great, but there are a few things they could improve on. For example, the insulation around the doors and windows could be improved. Also, the rooms on McKensie St. are very nice, but we stayed in a room once that was a few blocks down on Guadalupe which didn't have a comfortable bed and was rather small (but that was a few years back, so I don't know if they've improved or even still own those rooms).
