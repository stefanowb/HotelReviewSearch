The house itself is lovely, a large gracious staircase, lovely panelled bar, welcoming dining room, lovely breakfast in the conservatory on the side of the house. Our room was huge, with a bathroom attached from a private small corridor. Luxury indeed. Most hotels would have shoehorned an ensuite into the corner of our bedroom, and created two saleable rooms, but not here. This is not a \"boutique hotel\" offering, it is more like staying in someone's very comfortable, welcoming country house with great staff. The welcome was everything others have said - Anne is a true delight, warm and professional, friendly and available for all your needs. She directed us to a lovely walk past the waterfall in the grounds, along the river to the sea, which was exactly what we were after. When taking our orders on the bar before dinner she skilfully talked my boyfriend into having a totally different starter and main to his original thoughts, but he absolutely loved them. The quality of the food was the equal of much more expensive stops on our tour of the Highlands (including the much famed Albannach), which was a very pleasant surprise. We played a relaxed game of scrabble after dinner, until Anne had to close the bar at 11pm. Very quiet, we had a lovely night's sleep and a good quality breakfast in the morning. Unfortunately the location means we don't have an excuse to go back anytime soon, but if you are in the area, this is a wonderful choice.", "title": "Outstanding hospitality - super !!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "fivesheds", "date": "March 4, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 98927112}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We had a birthday celebration here in May 2011.
