Check-in was fine room was freakin awesome!! Then we decided to go to dinner. Came down ask the Valet to get our car, then proceeded to wait 10-12 minutes till it showed up. In the mean time not one other car came or left to distract the valet. So, when he finally showed, I asked if it typically takes that long to get a car. He responded by telling me that valet was a free service and if I wanted my car fast, then I needed to take care of him then he would take care of me!!!! I was blown away that he said that to my face. I went right in and told the manager. She gave me a pass that kept my car parked in front of the hotel for the rest of our stay. That way, we didn't have to deal with the Valets again. So, we were pleased until the next night when we come back from dinner and the head valet proceeds to tell me that he'll park my car this time, but from now on, I needed to go park it myself on the 10th floor of the parking garage because that's what VIP's do!!! I said that sounds like park your own car to me. He then told me he was there last night and saw the other valet get in trouble and he wasn't going to get in trouble, so I needed to park it myself then just walk back!! I said whatever, We're going to leave in the morning. We told the manager, then checked out the next morning. So, as long as you don't get a rental car, Platinum is great.
