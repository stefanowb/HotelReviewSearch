My room overlooked the Darling Hrbour and the city view at night from my huge hotel window caused me to sit and stare. The room was very modern, comfortable, clean, and trendy. I wanted to take the furniture home with me! My bed was a very trendy style with solid colored decorative pillows. The sheets were amazing and the comforter was white and comfortable. The bathroom was very modern with a wonderful lighting, comfy shower, and amazing showerhead. The flat screen TV was an excellent touch-but there were very few channels.

Only chose this option as Saturday night seemed to have no rooms available when booking direct with Novotel. Found the \"Fall in love again in Sydney\" package to be the best value as it included both dinner for two and breakfast. Well it turned out not to be the best choice. The dinner for two only offered a choice of either a entre & main or main & desert from the set menu.. which only had three choices... steak, fish & chicken being the mains. Had the steak the first night which was full of gristle and as tough as a slice of rubber. My partner had the chicken fillet which came with a bone and was rare. Mentioned the lack of choices to the waiter who suggest I will have to eat something twice, when I declined the wine menu we were then ignored all night. Very poor service indeed. Tried the fish the next night which was ok, my partner had the steak which was the other half of the piece of rubber I had the night before.... the next three nights we dinned elswhere. Darling Harbour has many great restaurants which are all superior and less expensive than the Dish. Whilst we had a great room with a nice view of the harbour, room servicing was a joke. Having been out all day we were very surprised to come back to an unserviced room. Had to leave the room until around 4.30pm before it was serviced. So much for a relaxing nap before dinner. Whilst some of the staff were more than hospitable, the hotel needs a lesson from the Gold Coast with regards to looking after their guests.. Will never go back to the Novotel.. This is not a 4 star hotel by my standards.", "title": "Dish Restaurant?

We had requested a non smoking room but obviously that means only the guests dont smoke but the cleaners can. Check out took forever as they only had one staff memeber on the desk and lots of people waiting to check in/out.
