As they don't have an online reservation system, I booked through an online third party reservation site (you can find it by searching for the hotel name on a search engine), and received a slightly better rate than the hotel was offering directly. Although somewhat nervous about staying at a \"YMCA,\" I arrived to find a hotel in a beautiful setting, on a well maintained, beautiful property, with unique and stylish common areas. Our room, on the third floor, was basic, but clean and had a nice international-grade bathroom. The restaurant, although not cheap, features beautiful outside seating which gives a splendid view of the property, King David road and the famous King David Hotel. It was a great place to enjoy a beer or coffee after a busy day of exploring the city. The included buffet breakfast was on a \"European standard\" -- simple and adequate (but nothing spectacular). The location-- about a 10 minute walk though fancy Mamilla to get to the Jaffa gate of Old Jerusalem-- was convenient and offered easy access to the sites of Old Jerusalem while allowing a break from the crowds, touts, and zealous shop owners of the Old City. If you plan to hit some of the further sites, taxi's are always parked across the street (in front of the King David hotel). I would, and very well may, stay here again-- and will recommend it to others headed to Jerusalem.", "title": "Beautiful setting, great location, decent value.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "twf2000", "date": "May 20, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 64841456}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "The location of this hotel is the best in Jerusalem.

The hotel was built in the 1930's and the building is absolutely gorgeous in the lobby and common areas, especially the view from the top of the tower. The restaurant is lovely with a lovely outdoor patio. But in terms of the guests, there are a few problems. The YMCA has not prioritized most of the rooms, which have not been updated for years and are very plain, as in hostel-plain. There are very few amenities such as radio, toiletries, or more than one towel per guest. There is construction going on outside the rooms, although this is not the hotel's fault. The reservations system is sadly out of date and very confusing to navigate, usually resulting in needing more than one long distance phone call.
