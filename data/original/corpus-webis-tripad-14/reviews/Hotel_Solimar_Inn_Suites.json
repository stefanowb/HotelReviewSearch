If you are going to cook, bring your own knifes, other than that the kitchen fed four people 2 meals a day with no problem. If they add some strong colors to the walls it would look awesome!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "GRojas", "date": "April 17, 2006", "id": 4983608}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Zihua hidaway", "text": "We booked at the Solimar through the web, intending to shop around for a better deal once we got there. In the end, we did not find anything as pleasant, clean, or comfortable for anything near the price (though there were lots of worse places; prices have gone up all along the coast). We liked the fact that this quiet hotel with its private pool was a short walk from the bustling town centre and close to Playa Madera, though we mostly took cheap cabs or combis to the farther beaches or buses from town to Ixtapa. Edison, the manager, was helpful and prompt in dealing with our requests. The apartment was spacious and comfortable. The kitchen is for whipping up simple foods, not for serious cooking. The pool was a hit with our five-year-old and a nice place to chill with a beer while deciding where to go eat.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 13, 2006", "id": 4457601}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Thanks for the tip, very nice petit hotel!", "text": "I picked the Solimar because of the reviews I read in internet -including tripadvisor- and after a visit to their website. Booked for a week to tried it out but ended up staying three weeks... my whole vacation. Why? - The place it's as described, nice large and clean rooms (suites), great friendly hosts, a relaxing pool and more. Every night I had my tequilas sitting at the balcony overlooking the small park while enjoying the great weather and the real Mexican atmosphere -mmmmhhhhh, I'm missing it already!- This was my first trip to Zihuatanejo and I felt in love with the place - Solimar is my lodging choice for my future trips, hope they will a have room for me!

Everything you need for a relaxing vacation. Just a tiny bit shabby, BUT very very clean! Excellent maid service, Lovely pool. good location just a few blocks from El Centro & Playa Madera. A real middle class Mexican neighborhood with very friendly people. Overlooks a small park. all rooms have at least one balcony & my Fav has two. AC, celing fans, TV (mostly Espanol) kitchenette. One thing that bugs me is a coffe pot & toaster are extra, \"Come on Edison they have to be paid for by now!\" A very good value with discounts for stays over 7 days.", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "peddler665", "date": "August 6, 2003", "id": 1213441}], "location": {"country": "Mexico", "region": "Pacific Coast"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 12, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 33}, "slim_ranking": 0.230769230769, "description": "Four level Mediterranean style building with 12 comfortable and nicely decorated suites of 430 and 540 square feet.
