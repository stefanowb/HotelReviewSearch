As I was arriving somewhat late, I called to reserve car pick up at the airport and to find out if room service was available 24 hours. I was advised that it was not, but that the hotel would make arrangements for me. I hesitated a little, but left it at that as if worse came to worse, I could jump in a cab and get some food.", "title": "Great little gem", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "islington3164", "date": "August 24, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "front_desk": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 8500064, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Impeccable service", "disliked": "\u2014 No a/c but really not an issue in Bogota"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great hotel, friendly staff, Loved it!", "text": "When I arrived in Bogota at 10 p.m. and got into the hotel car, the driver pulled out the room service menu and took my order while driving to the hotel.

While the hotel is on a main street, it wasn't too nightlife-oriented, just a few people that appeared to be out for a stroll. I had reserved a deluxe room which consisted of a small living room with a fully-stocked mini-bar and a small regular bar with several full liquor bottles under lock and key. Both the bedroom and bathroom were ample and the bed extremely comfortable. The room was spotless, as in all Melias, and the service, as mentioned before, impeccable.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "FerBarcelona", "date": "December 14, 2004", "id": 2882353}], "location": {"country": "Colombia", "continent": "South America"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 7, "very good": 15, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 32}, "aka": "Melia Santafe Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.30243902439, "description": "Spacious suites.
