The overall experience was good, considering that the service was excellent and all Cuban people working in the hotel were extremely friendly and welcoming. The beach was beautiful, but mostly wavy, kind of like in Punta Cana. The weather was great, just like in summer, although you could expect to wear a light sweater in the evening. The room was very basic, but clean and nice. The food, however, left us quite disappointed. We did not like the beach restaurant at all (considering that the food was the same every day, there were many flies, and there was hardly any choice). The Zun-Zun snack-bar next to the pool had good chicken sandwiches, and a la carta restaurant was fine but nothing fancy. Make sure you go to the Siriana or Perceo beaches, they were great! The cost of taking the train there and back is only 2 pesos per person, or you could try to walk west along the beach for about an hour (you could see iguanas on the way there).", "user": "Yuliya_A5", "date": "December 24, 2006", "id": 6490887}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved the beach", "text": "Just returned from Sol Pelicano, Cay Largo, my third trip. Twice last year (April & November) and again this past week in November. Previously I had thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and again I did enjoy my time there, but this time the food was awful, nowhere near as good as before. The dinner buffet was boring and often cold, and sometimes the meat was not cooked through eg the roast beef was red and running, the roast pork on another evening was also very very pink and running. I like my beef med. Rare, but this was rare, very rare. (read raw.) The vegetables were not good, the potatoes (when you got them) were mashed slop \u2013 where are the roasted potatoes that we had before? To be honest, I really liked the breakfast, as you can have your eggs cooked the way you like them, the croissants were quite good, however there was only one type of jam that was available. Also the A la Carte, (La Yana) was so disappointing. Last year the fillet mignon was fabulous, really tender and tasty, and the smoked salmon was delightful. This year, it was \u201cBeef escalote\u201d and believe me it was as tough as a piece of shoe leather. The best food we had was at the beach bar, everyday they had chicken which was very very good, and French fries which were also great. There was also fish and pizza available, plus some salads. We loved our lunches, and Thomas the chef was very good. The beach bar is the best place for food and drinks during the day time. Unfortunately they did not have the beach bar open for dinner on this occasion (last year it was open and quite good). The beach bar staff are wonderful and mix great drinks and have great personalities.", "user": "lindylou50", "date": "November 23, 2006", "id": 6168224}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Not for snubs!!", "text": "We cannot comment on the pool bar, as we only had drinks there on one occasion.

It is the fine white sand that never gets hot no matter how high the temperature. There are tons of palapas and beach chairs, but beware, there are no cushions for these plastic lounge chairs. We take our own cushions, and if you have a cheap \u2018blow up\u2019 mattress, that would be good too. Sitting for hours on rigid plastic is a little hard on the you know where.!!!! The beach goes on forever. There is another beach that you can go to, Sirena Beach. They have transportation 3 times a day to take you there for a cost of 2 pesos each. Of course you can walk, (as we do) and it will take you 1.5 hours each way. The best idea is to take the \u2018train\u2019 and then walk back.

Great Weather, very very hot. Hotel rooms r OK, don't expect 5 stars... but lots of mosquitoes which become a real nuisance at night time, my girl had at least 60 bites on her legs (she wears skirts often...), the baby that came with us had his face covered with bites (he slept in his crib outside). Bring a mosquito net for ur room with a hook u can stick on the plaster celling (not screw). The food was actually pretty good for Cuba. It is true that staff at first a real friendly and then less and less as time goes by. In this resort Tip is not just a word, just don't give too much; it does not increase the quality of service. Went to Paradise Beach; lots of litter, a real shame. The beach at the resort: very nice, specially if u like waves, to the Katamaran tour: it's worth the $. The entertainment is not that great, don't worry about the italians, they r not that loud and some of them actually don't walk around with their nose in the air. The only dissapointment was our departure; what a mess and transport from the resort to the airport was very dangerous to say the least; they had us pack into small buses with our suitcases on our laps...with a driver who thought he was on a race track... then 4 check- in counters for 180 people and a great mosquitoe welcome comittee (we waited 1 1/2 hours to pass customs).
