There is no swimming pool or restaurant for lunch or dinner, this hotel is very nice, comfortable, and quiet. The hotel is not as modern as the big hotel chains, but it has its own character and an inviting decor. We stayed in a standard room which are the smallest type they have, it was enough for us, it was comfortable and very clean. We were able to sleep in without any noises or interruptions. The nights we restful. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The price of the room included breakfast; ham, cheese, breads, fruits, cereals, coffee, juices, and a few other items. The breakfast was not bad, it was a nice way to start off the day. The location is excellent, very close to the casino, beach, and restaurants. The pricing may seems a little high, however the location, staff, and comfort make it worth while. Parking could be a little tricky at times, but it was not an issue for us. They have complimentary Wi-Fi and cable TV. My wife and I really enjoyed our stay here and will return again.", "title": "Great location and very comfortable!!!", "user": "J_Leal_XX", "date": "March 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 155552948}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had to change our hotel last minute last weekend when we were in Vina Del Mar. We showed up at Hotel Monterilla and the man at the desk was SO nice and got us a room right away. We even had the choice between carpet or ceramic...we went with ceramic and it was awesome! The hotel is right in the middle of all the action, and a 5 minute walk to the beach. Our maid was so nice; she even put some food in the hotel fridge for us...and then reminded us to grab it when we checked out. The hotel staff gave me a hairdryer to use when mine blew the power.This hotel is surrounded by great places to eat, bars, clubs, grocery stores, gas stations, the casino, and right across the street is a cute park with a fountain. We loved our stay here and will be back soon!", "title": "Great Location, Friendly Staff", "user": "tklang22", "date": "March 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154421398}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Chose this place from article in the New York Times.
