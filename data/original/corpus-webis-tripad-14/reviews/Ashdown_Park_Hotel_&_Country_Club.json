The spa itself included everything you expect, as well as a wonderful complimentary facial.

However, the highlight of the stay was dinner at the hotel restaurant, where we had 3 delicious course and a glass of champagne in the drawing room next door. The service was impeccable, and nothing was too much trouble.
