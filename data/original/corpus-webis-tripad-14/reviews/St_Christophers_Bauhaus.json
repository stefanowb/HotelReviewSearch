Problems began immediately: our room smelled overpoweringly of raw sewage, and the room itself was filthy. I never let my bare feet touch the floor because the carpet was so gross. We couldn't find the source of the stench problem until we opened the shower door, and what we saw was truly revolting: rusting shower (that no one would feel safe in) and a drain that apparently was connected directly to the sewage line. When we mentioned the problem to the hostel management they told us -- in a not-so-friendly-manner -- that it was our problem, and they could not help us until the next day.", "title": "Disgusting.

You see, the bar has a duel role of selling spirits and managing the hostel. Maybe I should have ordered a beer and in passing say that I wanted to check-in. They were more interested in the bar business than the hostel business. Brugge is wonderful and the place was cheap, so I would recommend the place for budget travellers. The shared shower facilities could have been more clean. The location is not ideal, but the historic town center is very walkable so it was not bad. A bus does run from the train station to the hostel or it will take to a good 15-20 minutes to hike up there.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "sixteencmg", "date": "December 20, 2004", "id": 2905704}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Stinky!", "text": "well for young people who dont care where they are staying its all right!! what i mean is it is VERY basic the pub attaching it has the best atmosphere you could ever imagine but put it this way the first thing i saw was a pile of dog poo in the middle of the floor and the fact that a mouse appeared in our shower from the middle of nowher ws amazing! i think i liked it so much cos im young and dont get phased by it but i can understand why people dont like it. id go back but only for a couple of nights at the most. oh and may i add we had to dispose of the mouse ourselves as after the second day no one had got rid of it!!!!!!!!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 18, 2004", "id": 2754895}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "I quite liked it", "text": "It must be pointed out that Bauhaus provide both hostel accommodation and hotel accommodation in 2 separate buildings!
