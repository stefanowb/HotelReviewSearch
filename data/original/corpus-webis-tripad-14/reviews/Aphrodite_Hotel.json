We had two triple rooms. These were just OK. Although the Aphrodite had been remodeled recently, it appears that some upkeep is now necessary. Bathroom fixtures are in great need of repair/ replacement and the comforters on the beds and sofas need a good scrub. The air conditioning was almost Non-existant resulting in us having to open the window, letting in mosquitoes. Otherwise it is still very clean. The noise level can be an issue if you are a light sleeper. The staff is courteous and its location to Termini cannot be beat for the price. My husband and I stayed here in 2004 and it is on a downward turn as far as upkeep. I am having issues with charges pending on my debit card for one night for each room which should not be applied since I paid in cash upon checkout.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 17, 2006", "id": 5474729}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Some problems", "text": "Having prior expierenc with the proprietors of this hotel, I was looking forward to our stay. Initially I was not disappointed, as it was conveniently located near Termini, non-smoking, all of the fixtures and furniture were new, and the desk staff spoke good English and were helpful and efficient. However, an hour after our travel companions return to their room to change out of their WEDDING ATTIRE, our friends received a call from the front desk asking them to run the shower for five minutes so they could test a leak in the room below. The bride asked if they could wait, seeing that the couple was one hour post-wedding. Evidently it could not wait and our friends complied, and were shortly thereafter were shuffled off to an even smaller room. (Originally we weren't bothered with the shoebox sized rooms seeing that we have come to expect that in big cities.) The second room suffered from dripping condensation from the air vent and our friends listened to the drip, drip, drip, all night rather than be shuffled to a third room. The staff did, however, allow them a late checkout to compensation. Of course, they didn't adequately note that anywhere so we had to struggle with each change of shift to make them aware. So . . . while the initial appearance was good, I'd have to say the substance was a bit lacking.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Noles9498", "date": "June 6, 2006", "id": 5315594}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "We just returned from 2 nights here.
