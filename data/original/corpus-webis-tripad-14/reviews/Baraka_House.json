The cabins are modern (with modern baths) and very clean with good A/C if needed. The locale is beautiful and peaceful. There's many good close-by day trips if you tire of Olympus/Cirali beach. The breakfasts are extensive with several fresh homemade items, and if you want to eat dinner at Baraka House, the meals are terrific. The owners are very friendly and will do just about anything to meet your needs.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Coolcoops", "date": "October 2, 2013", "id": 179461132}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Great family hotel. Just paradise on the Earth - almost nothing to add. We stayed in Baraka House for 2 weeks in late May and enjoyed each day of our stay. Bungalows are very cosy and clean, located not very close to each other - so you almost don't hear your neighbours. Very nice turkish breakfast, fresh juices and good mood :) And of course hospitality of Ishan and his family. Especially we want to admit dinners at Baraka House - Ihsan will personally cook for you. Grilled fish or meat that was bought especially for you, fresh salads, traditional turkish mezes and some great wine. Perfect dinner in the perfect place.", "title": "Great place", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Alexander K", "date": "September 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 175216466}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "If you like peace and tranquility, a sense of family hotel,a quiet beach, great food, superb accommodation and great service head for Baraka.", "title": "Just Wonderful", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Chopsies", "date": "August 29, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174689161}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We (family of 5) stayed for 8 days in August 2014 and the most fantastic time during this time we walked some of the Lycian Way (Grandpa ferried us up there at 6 am complete with packed lunch), went canyoning (Ihsan organised it all for us and delivered/collected us), saw baby Turtles on the beach (they told where and when) - we also went to the beach every day it's only 10m from the front door.", "title": "Unforgettable stay\u2026", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Suzanne255100", "date": "August 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 174062051}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "We looked forward to breakfast every day as it was so fresh and had dinner twice in, the freshest fish I've eaten for ages.", "title": "Wonderful Expereince", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "moongazergt", "date": "August 14, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 172219620}], "location": {"country": "Turkey", "region": "Turkish Mediterranean Coast", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Cirali"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 68}, "slim_ranking": 0.0344827586207, "description": "Comfortable detached wooden bungalows in a beautiful, spacious, large garden with oranges, lemons and fruit trees in garden, deck chairs, parasols and hammocks are available.
