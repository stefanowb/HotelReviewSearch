I booked 4 rooms at this hotel way back in JANUARY. Online it allowed me to book 4 jacuzzi suites (and charged me for them!) but when I called the hotel directly in MARCH they told me that they actually only have 2 jacuzzi suites and that someone other than myself had the second one! Can you believe that? They said that the other \"jacuzzi suites\" were just jetted tubs in the bathroom and not realy jacuzzi suites (even though in january I called to make sure, they said they had quite a few jacuzzi suites available). I had a really difficult time communicating with the woman who answered the phone. She was extremely combative and the only option she would offer me was to cancel all the rooms, so I let her. I wanted to make sure that we had enough rooms and that we had them all together so we wouldnt bother the other guests, but this hotel chain doesnt seem to care if you bother other guests. I called Holiday Inn Express guest services at the 800 number and they did little to help the situation (however they did reverse the cancellations). So I called the Wyndham Garden in Mt Olive and for half the price they gave me everything I wanted, with a smile to boot. Needless to say I cancelled all rooms at the Holiday Inn Express. Granted, the wyndham doesnt have jacuzzi suites but their indoor pool is open until 10pm and they have a great bar and restaurant in house that the holiday inn doesnt have so this is a much better choice. This is my second problem with the customer service at the Holiday Inn Express in the past few years, not just Newton, so it must be a training issue with the chain.

It has gotten to the point where we cannot accommodate everyone in our home or in the nearby bed and breakfast (the little kids have grown to be big kids!). That being the case, I was pleased to learn that a new hotel was built nearby, just eight miles from us. I was a little disappointed when I found out it was a Holiday Inn Express. Before I booked three rooms there, I went to take a look at it. I was quite surprised. My wife and I asked to look a couple of rooms and management was more than happy to show them to us. This hotel was great! Being brand new, everything is top notch. We booked the rooms and awaited the verdict from my relatives.
