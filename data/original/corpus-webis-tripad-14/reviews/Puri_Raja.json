Everything was close by.. Our rooms were always cleaned by the time we came back from breaky. Not sure if this was a fluke...as our friends didn't always have the same luck. (they stayed in the deluxe rooms at beach end)There are 2 pools one large one at the reception end, which is off the street side and one on the beach end with a swim up pool bar and the restaurant over looking the beach...we didnt mind the quietness of the smaller hotel, we had arrived before the school holidays had started and didnt find it a problem getting deck chairs, however once school holidays hit there seemed to be an influx of people around the pool and again the inconsiderate ones who left their towels on deck chairs for hours with the aim of reserving them for the day. Not on in my books, we have all payed to stay there. So on one occasion we just moved the towels and figured if they came back we would move and hopefully they would get the message. The longest we would sit around the pool was usually only for a couple of hours anyway , cause when the sun was out it was really hot..( hense we never saw the owners of the towels while we were using the chairs) this might seem petty but hey we are all on a holiday to relax...We always felt very safe at the hotel, we even left the teenagers at night so us adults could have some down time and a nice quite dinner... there are shops all along the front street side so you dont have to walk to far to grab a bargain......we would happily stay there again. On check in ( even after several phone calls and emails as to making sure they put the kids next to us as they kept telling me they didnt have interconnecting rooms ) they did put our kids at one end of the hotel to us, so i said no this isnt on as i have requested they be next to each other . So i asked what they had closest to our friends in the deluxe rooms and they found 2 rooms downstairs next to each other ( 115 & 116). one was made up and we just had to wait till they cleaned the other room, which was ok as we could use the kids room until ours was ready. Well not even 10mins later our room was all ready for us and quess what they were interconnecting rooms. Go figure! So in the end it worked out in our favour, we were just so happy to have the kids next to us. The hotel was in a great position as you could go for a walk along the beach front ,check out the restaurants, hire surfboards/boogie boards & deck chairs and umbrellas...for 2 deck chairs and brolly it cost us 50,000rp about $6 Aus for as long as we wanted them for..Just down the way a bit was the quick silver surf school so kids did that one day....I could just keep babbling on. We would definatley stay here again.
