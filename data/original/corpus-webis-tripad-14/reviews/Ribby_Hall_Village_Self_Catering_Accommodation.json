However there's just not much to do here. Climbing wall @ \u00a35 for 3 mins ! And no bowling alley. Also we took our bikes and there's no where to cycle on the site. The fact cars are allowed to drive round at all times (unlike Center Parcs) was pretty annoying as they never give pedestrians a 2nd thought, so not very child friendly in that respect.

The Village is well laid out and is well looked after. The standard of accommodation is fantastic, well above the usual self catering standard and there were lots of places to eat on site.

We ate in the Bar and Grill where the food and service were both lovely. We stayed for the entertain one night, which was fine for two 5 year olds but possibly a bit lacking for older children. I believe there is also daytime entertainment for children but we didn't bother with this. The pool/changing area was clean and well staffed with lifeguards.
