Everyone who worked at the reception was extremely friendly and helpful. We booked a package deal from their website that included city tour, ticket to the Carolus Therme, etc., and they spent quite a while sitting with us and explaining everything and feeding us snacks and sparkling wine. The room itself was spacious enough, pretty basic but comfortable and warm. Bathroom was functional. Breakfast was typical German breakfast - rolls, bread, cheese, cold cuts, boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt. Good tea. Location is a 10 minute walk from the center and 2 minutes from the station. I would highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a budget hotel in Aachen.", "title": "Good deal, warm reception", "user": "pepoling", "date": "March 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153956520}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here as a base for the belgian grand prix (spa is an easy 40 min drive from the hotel) in august 2010", "title": "not bad for the money", "user": "mcs1972", "date": "August 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 77742371}], "location": {"country": "Germany", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Aachen"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 0}, "slim_ranking": 0.704545454545}
