Micheline was taken ill during our stay, and so there were a couple of days that our bed was not made, but that was okay. We found our time to be a wonderful escape from the cold and hectic city. Unlike many hotels, La Guriniere is a place to retreat to. People go to Paris to see Paris, but forget that resting and recharging are essential to an enjoyable visit.

I always looked forward to Micheline's breakfasts (her crossiants and jams were the best!) and the morning chats we would have before we left on our sightseeing of Paris. She is very light hearted and always willing to help out with whatever questions you have and helpful in plotting out a more efficient route for your sightseeing. I can't stress enough how much it felt to me as if I were staying with family. Micheline and Jean Paul honestly put their best foot forward in order to make your stay relaxing and enjoyable.

The rooms are spotless, bathroom modern, near king size bed was comfortable and the hostess, Micheline, was very eager to please. In addition to providing fresh croissants, baguetts & other baked goods, coffee and tea for breakfast, Micheline also called taxis for us. One evening our daughter in law who lives nearby was visiting and was going to walk home after dark but Jean Paul volunteered to drive her at no cost. The B & B sits in its own small pleasant courtyard garden separated from the street by a high wall with a locked gate (we were given a key). The neighborhood around La Guirniere isn't much too look at, but there is an excellent pub (Le Timbre Post) about 4 blocks away where we had dinner (good food) three evenings after coming back from Paris. Also three beauty parlors, a newstand, a small grocery, pharmacie, and an ATM all close by. We took taxis into Paris because one of our group has trouble walking but there is a metro connection nearby.

My buddy and I recently stayed at this bed and breakfast for 4 nights based on reviews from TripAdvisor. This turned out to be an excellent choice. Micheline is an excellent host who was very pleasant to talk to each morning about our plans for the day, the differences and similarities in French and American culture, her many interesting B&B experiences, or anything else under the sun. She was also very helpful in giving us advise on where to eat in Malakoff, do laundry, access the internet, which bus or metro line to take, etc. The breakfasts are simple but delicious. Micheline has various breads, which of course include croissants, and she has a selection of interesting and tasty jams. Coffee and orange juice accompanied our meals. The town of Malakoff has a lot of little restaurants and a cool little bar nearby (the one with a bunch of signs lit-up at night) that we visited a couple of times. There was also a neat market very nearby on the weekend in the town square. The metro is about a 15 minute walk away and you can get anywhere in the city within 20-30 minutes. If you are looking to be pampered and having access to a concierge or other hotel amenities, you are better off not staying in this or any other bed and breakfast. But if you are looking for excellent value, friendly French hospitality and company, and a nice clean place to sleep each night with a comfortable bed, then La Guriniere is absolutely the place for you.
