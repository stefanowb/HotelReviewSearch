We were generously given a good rate on a family room 40 steps up on the second floor at the front of the heritage part of the building - I had been concerned to have a quiet room, and rooms in the newer wing at the rear of the building are more likely to get noise from the nearby pub on a Saturday night. Bearing in mind how close the hotel is to the centre of town, I was aware of some passing late-night traffic and a train, but this is an old, well designed and very solid building, and the sheer bulk of it muffles any outside noise, so that we slept peacefully and soundly.", "title": "Old, Gracious, Run Down, Comfortable, Cheap, and Handy.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Thomidog", "date": "October 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 82818377}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Another reviewer has written that this is backpacker accommodation. It is important to realise if staying here that it is difficult and very expensive in Australia to renovate heritage properties, and this one has probably not been fully renovated for many decades, if ever. Rather, it shows signs of being maintained as needed. The carpeting I would estimate is 40-50 years old, and in the style of Axminster carpets, initially so well-made and durable that it is still serviceable and not threadbare. The walls like any old rendered walls have suffered from occasional damp and accidental knocks and bangs and needed patching and repainting. One wall in our room had clearly been done fairly recently in a modern sponge finish.", "title": "top value & location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Jobi1kinobi", "date": "July 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 71980465}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Further to this however, the beds are older style, and some are starting to look a bit sad. The king bed in our room had only 5 of its 6 castors, so could not be moved, which was an issue as it had been rammed up hard against some power outlets, cramping the cables of appliances - a clock and a lamp - which were plugged in. I shifted the mattress enough to unplug these things while we slept. Another power outlet was found to be defunct when I realised my phone hadn't charged at all after an hour of being plugged in.

All the amenties you would expect were provided in the room - tea, coffee, fridge, TV etc, and there was a lot of space. The shower was good. The large downstairs eating and lounge area is nicely done up with modern furniture and would be a nice place to relax if you were staying a while. While no meals are provided on site, guests are welcome to bring food in for themselves and there was a toaster in this area, so the place has something of the feel of a boarding or lodging house. The staff here are relaxed, pleasant and personable, and were able to recommend places to eat - in particular the Infuze restaurant just around the corner was great. I would contemplate staying here for a week or two if I wanted to see the Goulburn area. If you can tolerate the idiosyncrasies of staying in something so historic, the Alpine represents excellent value for money.", "title": "A home away from home", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CharmaineVancouver", "date": "July 7, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 70070829}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife & I stumbled across this late in the evening enroute to Melbourne from Coffs Harbour.
