But there is something about Paris...and the George V is really the tops. I have stayed in a suite at the Ritz Carlton in Paris, the Intercontinental and other big hotels, many of which are stuffy, tired and over-decorated. The George V combines the old world elegance one expects of a grand Parisian hotel, but without the kitsch cliche's; here you will not find swathes of red velvet and generous gold trim on every surface, nor the trendy dramatic lounge d\u00e9cor typical of the fr\u00e8res Costes. Instead, grand rooms with fresh powder blue and elegant trim, high ceilings, impeccable bathrooms, plush towels, Bulgari bath accessories and a wonderfully well stocked minibar. Indeed, as at most FS properties, it smells like Bulgari everywhere. Staff are polite, extremely accomodating. Food is expensive but fresh and delicious. I went to a reception downstairs which was well-catered, no obnoxious piano music. Lovely, tasteful and perfect all around. And, of course, the location is superb; minutes from all the best shopping Paris has to offer.
