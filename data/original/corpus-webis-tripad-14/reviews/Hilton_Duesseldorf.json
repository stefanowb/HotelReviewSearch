The rooms are very nice, quite spacious. The only downside is the wireless cost at 22 EUR per day. It's 2012. Wireless should be included in all room rates. You could get for 9 EUR though for a smart phone !!!! Barthrooms nice with some nice toiletries provided. Shower also good with good temperature too.
