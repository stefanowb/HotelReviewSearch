Not the kind of first impression one would expect. But we loved our room, which was an upper-level cottage room. The decor is lovely, the linens divine and the bathroom was perfect. The view was of the interior \"courtyard\", which was a beautifully landscaped take on Monet's garden, with a large pond and flowering waterlilies.

Overnight guests can visit the spa for the steam room or sauna or the Aqua Terrace's oh-so-wonderful hot tub, which is unlike any hot tub I've ever seen. Do not miss this- my husband and I went out (it's outside) despite a chilly rain. There is also a small but well-equipped cardio room and exercise classes, but I'm guessing that unless you are super-serious about exercising, most people will choose the spa over the cardio. Still, all facilities are in top condition. The spa also has a small shop which sold the same shampoo and body lotion that was stocked in the room. Loved the rosemary mint body lotion.

That atmosphere has a real Monet/southern France feel. Our room looked out over the koi pond and Japanese foot bridge, lovely in March but must be breathtaking in summer, when all the rose bushes are in bloom. This was one of the prettiest views from a hotel room I have ever had. The gracious rooms are more than spacious and the bathrooms are double sinked, with a claw foot tub and large walk in shower. I did hear the phone ringing next door, so perhaps the walls are thin but noises (voices or tv) from the neighboring rooms never bothered us. We found a wonderful rate on their website (be sure to check, especially off season when they're trying to lure people in) which included spa treatments, which was the primary reason for the visit. We were not disappointed - impressive resting area with a huge common massaging foot bath, clean good sized locker area with many personal amenities (that varied from day to day, though; that was weird). My friends and I had 13 treatments total and all were wonderful, right up there with the best we've ever had The Aqua Terrace is such a lovely feature. I found all the staff to be gracious and pleasant - one morning we brought in pastry for breakfast, they had no problem with us eating in the little common area outside the dining room and even provided us with napkins and offered to clean up. They did seem to all be on the young side, which is neither here nor there. The only thing I noticed was there didn't seem to be anyone around to take our bags, not that it mattered, but they didn't even offer, when we checked in. We did not eat dinner there, we did have breakfast which was very nice but overpriced ($5 bagels?) but I understand the dining room food is excellent. We ate at Rosalie's (a 5 minute walk behind the cottages) and the Sherwood Inn, both good, and had lunch at Valentine's, a great place for an inexpensive lunch or quick supper. We went to both the Long Point and King Ferry wineries, chosen because they're about 5 minutes from each other and both were great experiences - I had emailed ahead, they offered us tours and extensive tastings. But back to the Mirbeau, probably you can find fault no matter where you stay if you look hard enough, but between the lovely room, beautiful grounds, friendly staff, upscale spa and general casually elegant ambiance, unless you have an isolated experience I can't imagine your having anything but a memorable time at this wonderful inn.", "title": "Just Lovely", "user": "PaulaRuth", "date": "April 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 7288145, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Lovely view of the pond from the room", "disliked": "\u2014 NOthing in particular"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "My fiance and I stayed here one night mid-week and absolutely loved it.
