So many restaurants and shops have moved elsewhere. Also, many roads are closed and it appears this changes often. We had to fend for ourselves and Peter did not provide a list of restaurants and where they are and how to drive there. The only thing he did was when we asked him he suggested one restaurant. When we got there it was totally full and it took us nearly an hour to find another one which was open/had tables.
