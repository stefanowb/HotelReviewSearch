We just spent a weekend at Les Mars hotel and it was perfect. We booked a Salon room on the third floor, which has soaring ceilings and a gas fireplace. The room was beautifully decorated with a bottle of chilled chardonnay waiting for us. But what really impressed us was all the special touches that weren\u2019t so obvious. The bathroom, with Waterworks pewter fixtures, drawers lined with hand-pressed linen cloths, and the Bulgari toiletries that other guests have commented on. The incredible bed that you sink into and never want to leave, with fabulous bed linens and pillows that made my husband say we should replace our bed at home. The complimentary breakfast brought to our room with amazing scones, yogurt with honey, and other delicious pastries and granola. The incredible staff, who were unfailingly polite and helpful. We had dinner two nights in a row at Cyrus, the restaurant connected to Les Mars and one of the top restaurants (along with French Laundry) in the SF Bay area. Cyrus was incredible \u2013 we ate in the bar where they serve the full dinner menu. We were blown away by the quality of the food, the inventiveness of the cocktails, and the knowledgeable waitstaff.

If you brave the world outside of your room, the staff will make you feel right at home, as they get you some fresh lemonade and cookies, or, if you join them before dinner they will lead you through a tasting of local wines and outstanding small production cheeses. The staff is very knowledgeable, and makes out stand reservations if you want to go out for dinner...but why would you do that. Not only is the hotel outstanding, but its restaurant is the best you will find in the valley (if not the state). With the entrance right in the lobby, you do not even have to venture outside. But do not get it wrong, this is far from a \"hotel restaurant\". Cyrus is not only Relais Gourmand, it is Michelin starred. As mentioned, not your average \"hotel restaurant\".
