After spending a great week in Seaside, we needed to book a hotel room for one night b4 returning home from our summer vacation.

We booked a room with 2 queen beds on Hotels.com and were anxious to spend a restful evening in beautiful surroundings. After check-in, much to our surprise, we found the room that we were given had not been cleaned with unmade beds. When we returned to the front desk, the college interns (who, by the way, were GREAT) were very apologetic and offered to upgrade us to a room in the newest building in the complex.
