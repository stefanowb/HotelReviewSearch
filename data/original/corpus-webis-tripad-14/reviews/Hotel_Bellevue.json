It was our first time in Dusseldorf, and they helped us with maps and even lent us an umbrella so we could venture out in the rain. The internet in the hotel lobby was fast and free, the room was large and perfectly adequate, although not new, everything was very clean and well cared for. The breakfast was GREAT! A wonderful assortment of hot and cold foods, one of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever seen. I am still raving about the chocolate granola cereal and wish we had it in the US. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

No, it's not a 5-star luxury place but, then, it doesn't charge those prices either. Value for dollar, you cannot beat the Bellevue. Room was fine: clean, comfortable bed, bigger than I am used to for a single room in German hotels. It's not air conditioned, but you can open two large windows and they have an oscillating fan in the room. Free coffee available 24/7. Free wireless internet access. Typical German hotel bathroom: absolutely spotless. Some of those luxury 5-star places could take lessons from the staff of the Bellevue. Speak excellent English, friendly, helpful, etc. I reported that I had a flickering light bulb in the desk lamp and it was replaced within 15 minutes! Large, nice breakfast room. Scrambled eggs and sausages, variety of rolls, juice, fresh fruit, dry cereals, etc. Close to the central train station; maybe a 20-minute walk to the Altstadt.", "title": "Excellent value", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "paulmckibben", "date": "September 8, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 40101864}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed one night at the Hotel Bellvue while traveling through D\u00fcsseldorf on my way back to the U.S. after 5 nights in a lousy Paris hotel.
