Since we traveled without children this trip and usually stay at high end adult only resorts, we were very apprehensive about the prospects of so many out of control kids taking over the property. I must say, we had nothing to worry about. Yes, there were lots of kids, but since they were constantly entertained ( plenty for them to do), they were \"happy campers\". We actually enjoyed watching them enjoy themselves. Also, the food and service was EXCELLENT. Cleanliness flawless. The resort has many nooks and crannies to get away from the kids and two fantastic restaurants, a great bar and hot tub just for adults only. We even found a few slot machines that actually were paying off.

My husband, 3 year old and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I'll jump around a bit to try and cover everything. Airport transfer, incredibly easy and efficient. They huddle you outside, point you to a van, load your stuff, drive you there. No muss no fuss. We stayed in the French Pavilion, the lobby was gorgeous. In fact, the whole place is gorgeous and I think that's the thing that stuck with me the whole trip - the resort is immaculate. Clean, sparkling clean, everywhere you look. It looks like Disney (well the Disney I remember from the 90s). It has the otherworldly quality of beauty and lush flora. Really nice. We stayed in the French Pavilion in a ground floor walkout. While I know everyone raves about the Italian location, the French Pavilion was simply gorgeous. The room was spacious and clean, except for an ant problem which was restricted to the bathroom. I noticed it at first, and though, eh whatever. By day three, there was an army. And truth be told, we were too darn lazy to switch rooms and I thought for sure I would remember one day to ask housekeeping to do something. Lo and behold I came back one day and they were gone - every last ant was gone and none ever came back. That goes to show someone is paying attention and cares enough to do something about it, which I thought was wonderful. We had a king bed with a trundle bed couch which was great. Probably the thing I liked least, even more than the ants, were the snacks for SALE in the room. For an all inclusive resort this seems rather strange. Bottled water in your fridge is free, and is replenished daily which is great. There was no alcohol in the room, which would have been nice and I never did figure out if you could just get a bottle of wine somewhere and bring it back to the room. That is probably the biggest drawback of staying in the French Pavilion - I hear there were snacks and alcohol in other parts of the complex - but then again, was I willing to pay an extra $200+ per day for that, not really. The pool at the French Pavilion was wonderful and a special enclosed wading pool for little ones was my daughter's favorite spot the entire trip. The water in the wading pool was super warm, warmer than the big pool, but I found both to be the perfect temp for us. The pool is huge, relaxing and the bartending was terrific. I did not have one weak drink the entire time we were there. Which is saying a lot since I expected otherwise. In fact occasionally I had a drink that was too strong. Back to the room for a second, I loved our room, but am not sure a walkout was necessary. The pool is too far from the glass doors to feel like you could leave your room unlocked, so that's something to consider should you stay here. Poolside there were always an abundance of chairs and towels.", "title": "What a Lovely Place", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Amymow", "date": "January 4, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 52540759}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with family", "text": "The Sesame Street shows were great, my daughter loved them.
