The look of the commons areas was very sleek and Art Deco. It was not a bargain stay, but I think their prices fluctuate wildly depending on season, and the rates do include complete breakfast. Breakfast included cappuccino (or whatever coffee you want), canned-style fruit, several fruit juices, few fresh fruits, couple dry cereals, scrambled eggs, scary bacon, hot-dog-like sausages, fresh pastries/donuts, cold cuts/cheese and rolls, yogurt. So fill up on breakfast for your Rome trekking. Our room for 2 was very small, but expected for Europe. The 2 twin beds were pushed together, but made up separately. Window overlooking the \"alley\" (street) the hotel is located on so could gauge weather before leaving. My first shower there, the water was barely warm. Told the front desk and we didn't have that problem again. Our sink had a drainage problem but we made our own solution. The toilet had problems fully flushing, which caused a slight odor. Nice full wardrobe to store clothes/shoes. Confusing SkyTV system, which didn't have great news channels and was difficult to navigate. Didn't find that many affordable restaurants nearby, at least not as many as Piazza Navona area, where I would stay next time. This hotel located right at Piazza Popolo, and walking distance to Trevi, 7 min to Spanish Steps, can walk to lots else too, depending on how much you like to walk. Room was nice and warm which was great since weather was cold during our visit.", "title": "Nice hotel in good location with good breakfast", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "steptravel", "date": "March 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 98659917}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel was very nice.
