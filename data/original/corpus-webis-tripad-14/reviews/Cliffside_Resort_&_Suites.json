Nice little picnic area down by the lake with picnic tables bbq grill fire pit's. Sandy little beach area.we had a room overlooking the lake that's the way to go.

When we arrived check in went good. The place looked nice from the outside. When we walked in our room there was a awful smell. I would say it smelled musty. My husband said it smelled like snuff. We turned the A/C on high and opened the windows for a few hours. When we came back to the room it still smelled but not as bad. So this was just the start of our bad experience. The A/C was so loud that it woke me up everytime it started up during the night. And that was very often. The fridge made noise all the time I only noticed it at night when I was trying to sleep. So you think all these bad noises and smells are bad right. Well then we go to take a shower and the tub is half full when we are done with the shower and my husband has to wait 20 minutes after me to shower so the tub would drain. The sink was also slow draining (that grosses me out when I am brushing my teeth). They also didn't clean the bathroom from day to day and when I stay in a hotel I want my bathroom cleaned. I clean mine at home everyday so I expect they should as well. I also believe they did not wash the sheets from day to day either. When I complained about these things they told me they would right them down and check into them. The guy that runs the place took a screwdriver with him and said he was going to get the hair out of the tub drain. The other problems I think are alway there so they didn't mention doing anything about those. They did not offer a discount. She said I should have mentioned it before checkout. I asked if the had another whirlpool sweet they could have moved me to and she said no.
