Our flight arrived after 10:00 p.m. and we called to request a shuttle. Our driver was at the curb almost before we were. Our check-in took a few minutes because the desk clerk was obviously answering questions about booking a guest on the phone. We were able to make arrangements for an 11:00 a.m.shuttle to the port-although our family of four filled the last few spots on the list. Our room was graciously sized and clean. Everything was fresh and in well working order. My son says the couch sleeps great also. We were on the top floor and on a corner. The airport noise was dying down by this point of night and did not bother us. The planes began flying again fairly early, but that is to be expected. Breakfast was typical. The area was clean and well serviced. I did find the safe charge unusual from other hotels. Upon check-out, I mentioned this to the clerk and he asked if we had used it. I told him I had never even seen it. He did remove the charge. Our shuttle to the port was on time and met our needs well. The hotel has several amenities that we would have used has time allowed. My teen son spotted the military store from our window and we spent a few minutes there before catching the shuttle. Our stay exceeded our expectations for this trip.
