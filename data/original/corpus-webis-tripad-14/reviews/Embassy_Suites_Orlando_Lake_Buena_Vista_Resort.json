I was a little concerned because not all reviews were favorable, but they must have stayed somewhere else. The hotel is in a great location and just a few minutes from the gates of Disney and Seaworld. The staff was great and the room was above average. It was clean and comfortable. It was not over the top, but a very good value for the money. The restaurant is pretty good and my son enjoyed the pool. Disney not have indoor pools at their properties (or microwaves) so this was a big plus to stay off site so early in the year. I tavel a fair amount for work and find the Embassy a great place to stay with the free breakfast and cocktail hour.

Famous last words:) The next afternoon having still not heard from anyone I called and was told by Carol that there was no availability. Needless to say at this point I wasn't very happy. I then spoke to another manager who told me she would take care of the problem and while in the middle of the conversation Carol miraculously found my reservation.

When we found our way to the room I was very disappointed. In order to get to our room we had to exit the main hotel on an upper floor and go to an attached outdoor building that surrounded the pool area below. The pool was MUCH smaller that I expected. The lanai view was not what I expected as it was just a larger concrete area in front of the hotel door with 2 plastic chairs that were dirty and a small table. Upon entering the room I immediately wanted to go home. It was dark and damp. The furnishings looked fairly new but the bed spreads were more like worn out blankets with a native american design. The microwave was the tiniest I have ever seen and there was no natural light what so ever. The front room window opened to the walk way and \"lanai\" and the back window had a view of I-4. For those of you not from FL it is the major highway that runs through Orlando. I had asked several staff members on more than one occasion if this hotel was renovated due to my daughter's asthma and my acute allergies. I was reassured everytime that it was a few years ago. The only reason I did not go home was b/c I had promised my daughter that there would be a movie on the big screen outside. The weather held off and we were able to see the movie from our \"lanai\". The sad thing is that we probably had the best seats in the hotel. The next morning we could not find the \"do not disturb\" sign so we called the front desk to tell them we did not want our room cleaned. We had planned on spending the day at Seaworld since we were so close and then going home. When we came back that evening to check out our room had been cleaned. As locals we knew enough to take our valuables with us but as tourists in our area please remember to be careful. I was so astonished that people were allowed in our room!

They played movies on the shuttle buses for the kids. One thing to note is there is no early return on the shuttle bus from Disney. The earliest pickup was at 6:15 pm, so once we were there, we were committed to the entire day. Pizza Hut on site was a bonus! The pool was heated and lovely. Breakfast was really good, but on the busy weekend they ran out of everything including coffee and bowls. The staff just could not keep up with the volume. The housekeeping was good, except one day they just made the beds and did not vacuum or clean. I think the housekeeper must have been distracted halfway through. Having a refrigerator, microwave and 3 sinks made a big difference. My kids loved the squirrel and the little black kitten by the pool.
