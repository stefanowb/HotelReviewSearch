Anne are very fortunate to have them! My husband and I spent a wonderful Valentine's Day weekend, complete with poetry readings of love poems, sonnets, etc. in their Cafe Collette on Sat. night. Peter and Elizabeth are quite a team and she has great culinary gifts (her breakfast crepes cannot be beat) and his woodworking/renovative skills have done wonders for the Alexander home. They also have a cozy sitting/reading room where time almost stands still for quiet reading/work/reflection. If you are looking for a restorative B&B in a quiet, historic town w/little traffic, try the Alexander house and don't forget your books!

Three words describe the visit best: It Was Fabulous! Each night I returned \"home\" to the Alexander House from long and sometimes tense days to a much-needed, quiet retreat. The porch was my personal favorite but it only slightly won over Elizabeth's delicious breakfasts. Together with the serene environment, and wonderful summer evenings, I was able to return to the next day's meetings refreshed and re-energized. And, Elizabeth offered the wealth of information I needed to make the best use of my time between meetings. Although I was there for work, I felt as though I had a \"mini\" vacation.
