The hotel however is not quite as luxurious as the photos would make it out to be. Yes, the pool and the grounds are a delight but the rooms are in need of updating. The vast majority are NOT located in either of the two mansion houses on the estate but in purpose-built blocks. As such, they are more functional than attractive. It's clearly a hotel that makes its money from hosting conferences and hospitality events. I would not recommend it for a romantic weekend - too impersonal. I used the 'sports center' - again, a facility that looks a little tired but all the machines worked so I got my work-out! Nice to step out of the gym and straight into the pool area! Our bed was very comfortable, the towels fluffy and the toiletries of a good standard even if they didn't provide any shower gel, just shampoo and conditioner. The hotel's location means it is not really suitable for those without a car.
