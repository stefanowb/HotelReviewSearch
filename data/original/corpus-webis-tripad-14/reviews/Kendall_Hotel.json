Check in was quick and I was so pleased to step into our large, comfortable and nicely decorated room. And most importantly, it was so CLEAN! The bathroom was immaculate, like it was brand new. I am a very fussy person and this hotel lived up to my expectations. I didnt sleep so well as our room was adjacent to the elevator but it wasn't a huge problem, because it was otherwise the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in. The free buffet breakfast was delicious, with pancakes, bacon and eggs, fruit salad and FRESH orange juice. I do recommend you get down there early though, as there was a line at about 9.30am when we ate. I can't believe such a great hotel with free breakfast could be so affordable. The location is also excellent - right next to the T stop, and only a couple of stops into the heart of Boston.
