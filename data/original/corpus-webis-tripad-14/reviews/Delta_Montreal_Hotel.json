I had stayed at the Delta before, and I'd had a decent stay, but the rooms were rather dated at that time. What a pleasant surprise this time! The rooms were newly renovated, large and very modern. The girl at the front desk was VERY pleasant and told us that she'd put us in a nice room since we were so exhausted from hotel searching all evening. The room was just lovely and very clean. The bathrooms were gorgeous, had large counters, and a decently sized stand-up shower. The renovations were obviously not complete yet, as there were no baseboards in the hallway, but that's not a big deal. It happens.

The hotel is centrally located in downtown within walking distance of a number of downtown sites such as McGill University and Old Montreal. The hotel public areas such as the lobby and the restaurant were very nice, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Ate the breakfast buffet one morning, and it was excellent though rather expensive (~$20). The room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The A/C worked very well. I've read about the hotel going through some renovation, and I believe my room was one of those that had been renovated. It was nice but it appeared as if some of the finishing touches (e.g. baseboards) were still to be completed. The biggest issue was with the room's internet access. The renovated rooms are equipped with a new \"SmartDesk\", which consists of a desk with various types of connectors (e.g. Ethernet for wired internet access, HDMI for playing video from your PC to the flat screen TV, etc.) In the case of my room, the wired Ethernet cable did not work, and I was told that their wireless internet was better anyway. Well, it was good, as long as my laptop was near the entrance to the room. If I sat at the desk or on my bed, the wireless access cut in and out. Needless to say, this was rather frustrating when I was trying to check email or get on Skype. So, I had to sit near the door to maintain an Internet connection. The bottom line: while I would be willing to stay here again, I would probably consider other options in downtown. And if location was not an issue, I would be inclined to stay further down the island in the Hotel du Fort (where I've stayed in years past), where the value might be a little better.", "title": "Pleasant Stay with a Few Technical Wrinkles", "user": "SoftwareBug", "date": "July 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 133945305}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Will be back", "text": "We used to stay at Delta's in Montreal but stopped because the hotels were in rough shape with old rooms and bathrooms I couldn't stand.

Overall an excellent stay, seamless check-in and -out, timely and friendly housekeeping, accommodating bilingual staff. The rooms were typical of a chain hotel but our 21st floor corner room, though shaped oddly (would not be good for larger people due to the small space in between the desk that stuck out and the foot of the king-size bed), it was clean, fresh and comfortable with a large bathroom (no problems with hot water, even for two separate showers in a row) and small balcony with a great view. We found the bed, pillows and comforter very soft and comfortable. The TV had basic cable that did tend to fuzz out very slightly and sputter a little in rainy weather. With the club room upgrade (an extra $20 a night on Orbitz) we got free continental breakfast two floors up in a lounge area as well as daily happy hour with delicious appetizers and an honor bar. The food was definitely above-average for a hotel spread, and the staff so friendly. My boyfriend loved the fitness room, which seemed small at first but had enough to keep him occupied all three days, and I hung out at the indoor pool (too small to really have fun in, but clean, not very crowded and not too warm or cold) and hot tub, which was nice, but not very new or high-tech. The location was by far the best - walking distance to old montreal, the southern plateau area, all the shopping, and bars and restaurants. We didn't need to take the metro anywhere. We will stay at the Delta Montreal again, especially if we get a similar flight-and-hotel deal from a site like Orbitz.", "title": "Nothing to rave about!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "canuckpump", "date": "March 30, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3314036}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Montreal is a very expensive city.
