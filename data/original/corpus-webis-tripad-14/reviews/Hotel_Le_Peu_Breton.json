Firstly the positives: The breakfast was good and the pool and gardens were nicely maintained. Contrary to some of the previous reviews, we actually liked Sainte Marie and La Noue and weren't as bothered that it was quieter as we were travelling with a baby so weren't looking for extensive nightlife. The larger towns are also very easy to get to by car or bike, so not an issue. Now the negatives: The room felt a little on the small side, especially with a travel cot set up in it. To be honest the hotel feels a little 'squeezed in' overall. I think the owners have done well to get everything crammed in to the plot, but it still does leave you feeling a little cramped. The second negative for us was the absence of any form of air conditioning or fan. We only went in early summer and our room was like an oven, making it hard for us to sleep and impossible for our daughter to sleep which definitely detracted from our enjoyment (and probably also for the poor people on either side of our room!) We did ask the owners for a fan and were initially refused but a few days later offered one but the weather had cooled by that point so it wasn't as much of a problem. We were aware at the time of booking that there was no air con, but there should have at least been some sort of way to circulate the air in the room. There was a convection heater/blower mounted to the wall which didn't work or was switched off for some reason and also a sign saying that you shouldn't open the windows to allow the blower to work, which was quite annoying given that it didn't. There was also an issue with housekeeping as our room wasn't made up for two days as we were in the room when they wanted to do it and then didn't bother to come back once we'd left (we must've only delayed them for about 20 mins). Overall this hotel isn't bad for the price, but the negatives I've mentioned do definitely make this an average hotel rather than a good or excellent one.", "title": "Ok hotel for the price", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Dom-n-Lin", "date": "September 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 117597898}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "I can't understand the negative reviews, although we only stayed for one night driving down through France.
