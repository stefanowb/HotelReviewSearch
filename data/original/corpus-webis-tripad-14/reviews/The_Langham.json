Since my son was going to join us in town I decide to stay in house. The moment I arrived nothing was too much of a problem they offered to park my car and my bags where unload for me taken straight to our room, they even notice my shoes need a good shine and cleaned them for me.

Then they blew my mind away we not a rich couple or anything special and without asking and at no extra charge they upgrade us to a suite which gave us access to a special area call the club rooms. The suite was to die for beautifully decorate and the d\u00e9cor was luxurious they even turn our beds down for us with chocolate on the pillows. Our diner reservation was at eight we decide to avail us of the services in the club rooms where they offer their guest pre-dinner drinks and nibbles to contemplative the day and plan for what you are going to do for the night. Again service was excellent where nothing is too much trouble and the nibbles scrummy and lick smacking good. When my son arrived he was escorted and seated at the restaurant and we were advised of is arrival. They say the Eight restaurant is a Culinary Journey they are so right but it also the small things like our waiter Michael cleared our plates immediately kept our glasses of water and wine top up not imposing but ready to help. At midnight they had staff ready to take us to the roof top to see the fireworks at sky city tower. After midnight we retreat to our sanctuary with a bed so soft and supported we had a fantastic night sleep follow my breakfast in bed and a late checkout.
