Driving to the resort the surrounding area is very poor and the road construction is absolutely awful!!!

Within another couple mintues we had a chilled towel and a glass of wine waiting for our room key. We had booked a royal premium room and were told that we were going to get upgraded, so we were very excited!! Once we got to the room, our hearts sank to the floor. The room looked like a camp cabin. Tiny window A/C unit, no glass windows, just wooden slats that closed, the bathoom was worse or the same as a low end Holiday Inn, and the safe was all rusted. As the bellboy finished dropping our luggage off he said \"Is there anything else I can do for you\", while swatting mosquitos from his face, in the room mind you!!! We were very upset with the room, especially since it was an upgrade. Anyways, we talked to the office and got a much better and nicer room, with the low low price of $80 more a night, but it was well worth it. The new room was really nice, big bed, big shower, mini-bar, and mini-fridge, stocked everyday. Everything else during our trip was pretty good.
