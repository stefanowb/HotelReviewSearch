Hotel was wonderful, room was spacious, clean and well equiped. We ate in The Croft Restaurant every night (in a separate building just across the road from the hotel). Food was delicious and service excellent. You do need to book a table in advance as it does get very busy. Breakfast was taken in the main hotel and again the food was very good and service very efficient. Throughout our stay we found every member of staff to be extremely pleasant and helpful and you got the impression that they all loved their jobs and they all got on extremely well together which does create an excellent atmosphere which, as guests, we picked up on. Location is ideal. We were lucky to get a car parking space as these are limited, however, once we had parked the car we left it there until we checked out. Plenty to do in Bourton on the Water and it is a pleasant walk to nearby Lower Slaughter. This is definitely the hotel we will stop in next time we visit the Cotswolds.", "title": "Wonderful Relaxing Break", "user": "Cakesy", "date": "April 6, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 60503525}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Cute hotel in a beautiful location.

The restaurant was very nice, but again you sort of felt like they were doing you a favour letting you eat there - and lets face it, for the cost of both the room and the restaurant I think we were the ones providing the favour!!
