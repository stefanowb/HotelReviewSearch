The wide, white sand beach is right there. It's great for walking, sitting, sunning. We didn't try the water for swimming, but it looked good. There's a great little restaurant next door, Clear Sky Cafe, that I would highly recommend. The only down side is the cost - very expensive. And then they add a resort fee and a parking fee.

We rented from an owner (the top two floors are privately owned) from VRBO. Our unit was on the eight floor and had two balconies with views of both the gulf and the intercoastal. The suite was one bedroom with a full kitchen and was gorgeous! The resort itself in my opinion is comparable to top resorts (and I've stayed at places like Four Seasons) as far as how they make you feel pampered. One thing I noticed is that everything was so clean (the pool, the bathrooms by the pool, the overall hotel facilities). The pool was very enjoyable, not too crowded and it was easy to get a chair of your choosing without having to get up at the crack of dawn like some resorts. The location of the hotel was perfect as the view from the pool of the beach and gulf was spectacular. The sand on the beach is best described as like talcum powder as it is so very white and fine. Since this was our \"babymoon\" I enjoyed a pre-natal massage at the Spa which was great. We also dined at Caretta on the Gulf for dinner one night and had a beautiful outdoor sunset view for my husband's birthday. The food and service were also good for us. We were in town also to see Phillies spring training and had the pleasure of meeting/seeing Jimmy Rollins, Ryan Madson and David Herdon at the pool which was a nice surprise.

The room was tight for 5 of us, but we managed to make it work, as it was what we could afford. However, the only downside to our time at the Sandpearl was the lack of privacy in the room. The wall between the bathroom and the bedroom was really a set of shuttered doors which, if opened, allowed you a view of outside looking over the beds in the room.

Prior to our arrival, I indicated that our trip was needed for some very specific reasons and the Sandpearl not only put us in one of the best rooms, but also sent chocolate covered strawberries to our room. This was very appreciated and made us realize just how special a place this is. In fact, during the entire trip, the Sandpearl staff could not have been any nicer.", "title": "Why stay anywhere else on Clearwater Beach?", "user": "goohiostate", "date": "February 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 95609977}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled with family", "text": "Cannot ask for a better location either -- steps away from 3 of the Frenchy's restaurants, including the Rockaway Grill right next door (the Grouper and She-Crab soup are great). The Clear Sky Cafe, also steps away, is also very good. It was also nice having shops nearby -- we walked on Mandalay every day (loved the old-time candy store). When we decided to try a local pizza place for delivery when the weather wasn't the best, we tried Bro's per the Sandpearl's recommendation -- loved it!! I would also highly recommend a limo ride to/from the airport from Ambassador Limousine -- really not that much more expensive than a taxi/shuttle ride and worth it.", "title": "wow!!!", "user": "poppyCheshire", "date": "February 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 95585592}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Although we didn't have the best weather (rained a little and was a tad bit colder and windy than normal), we will certainly be back -- hopefully soon!!", "title": "Top Notch-Unbelievable on all Accounts!", "user": "JNS-1967", "date": "February 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 95338580}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "I would like to say that our visit to the Sandpearl Resort was the highlight of our trip to Florida.", "title": "O M G", "user": "luv2golfDenver", "date": "January 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 94873548}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Clearwater"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 40, "average": 78, "very good": 232, "terrible": 19, "excellent": 729}, "aka": "Sandpearl Hotel Clearwater", "slim_ranking": 0.0625, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.5, "location": 5.0}, "description": "With a stunning location along a 700-foot expanse on the sugary white sands of pristine Gulf of Mexico beach front, Sandpearl Resort's casually elegant surroundings provide guests with a vacation experience unmatched on the beach.
