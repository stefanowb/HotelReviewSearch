Every staff person I encountered was friendly, from the bellman to the cleaning staff. To make up for some inconvenience with our booking (which was alleviated before our arrival), the hotel had a room available for us when we arrived early, and as a thank you to us for being flexible, the manager delivered fresh fruit and bottled juices to our room shortly after we checked in. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It's only two blocks from Michigan Ave and right on the shuttle route for Navy Pier. The complimentary breakfast is more than sufficient with a variety of delicious items as well as a \"cook to order\" station for omelets, etc. Afternoon cocktails and appetizers are offered in the atrium in a relaxing, fun atmosphere.

They run 9 am to 9 pm, so if you get a spot at night, you don't have to get up at dawn to move it. The lot which is located southwest across the intersection of Illinois and Columbus from the hotel charges $22 for 24 hours (with, obviously, no in and out priveleges), so we did use that for a long stint that first night. Another parking location that can be attempted is the lowest of the 3 levels of Wacker Drive, just south of the Chicago river.
