Expensive at $17, but you can book as a winter deal and get breakfast included if you prepay. All the food was expensive here so we chose to dine outside other than breakfast. Bellboys gave a full spiel about the hotel, the emergency exits, the restuarants, etc. Housekeeping cleaned our room as we ate since we were travelling with a small child.
