The price for the suite was 110 GBP a night &, having stayed at several small hotels in London on other trips, I thought we got very good value for the money. True, the rooms are smallish, the TV isn't going to entertain you for long & we would have appreciated a coffee set-up in the room rather than in the bar area but we would still stay here again. The rooms were clean, the staff was very friendly & helpful & the area was perfect. There is a Hilton on Praed St. - right near Paddington - where you can go for more action than you'll find at the Mitre House bar & have actual cocktails which are sometimes difficult to find. Lots of good restaurants & pubs at all price levels in the area too. We also thought breakfast at the hotel was fine.", "title": "Very Decent Budget Hotel", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "bc713", "date": "October 8, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4002199}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2004", "text": "Hello to all,", "title": "Would go back to Mitre House", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MitreHouse", "date": "October 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3992881}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Safe and good location at Mitre House", "text": "We are just back from London.
