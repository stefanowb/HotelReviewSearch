If you do not have a car you will need to use public bus transportation if you want to go to downtown for shopping,restaurants,riverfront cruises, segway tour at the park, etc. Since the concierge had no info on the bus or the trolley (which was rarely in the area) we ventured out to find the bus stop. Thank goodness some people were waiting and told us to use bus #11...and it comes every 30 minutes. We used the bus to go to downtown and found the bus terminal to get a schedule.
