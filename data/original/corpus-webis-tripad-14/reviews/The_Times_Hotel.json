Rooms are clean, new and modern. The one with the 'Nachtwacht' /' Nightwatch' painting on the wall is very special. The rooms are not really large but that doesn't matter cause it is a real hotel for tourist and not so much for business travellers. The Staff is very friendly and it is located in my favorite part of Amsterdam on the Herengracht. This where you can see and experience Amsterdam at it's best.", "title": "Loved it!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "ans206", "date": "May 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5044039}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "We just returned from this amazing hotel. There were 18 of us traveling together for a Bachelor/Bachelorette Party, and we all stayed here. The staff was always kind and helpful. The rooms were small, but the use of the space was very effective. We really enjoyed the location of the hotel as well. There's a great Coffee Shop called Amnesia just next door. Ann Frank House is a 5 minute walk away. It is a central location to the Red Light District and the museum district, too.
