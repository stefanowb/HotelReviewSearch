This is the third year i've been back, in 2011 visited 7 times over the season. It is a family run park and they are always very helpful,polite and approachable. The site is very well maintained with most pitches being on flat ground. The toilet block / showers are immaculately clean, there is always hot water available. The shop is handy for all things essential (one very good point about the shop is it has set opening hours) (i have been to another campsite previously and they opened and closed the shop when it suited so you never knew if you'd be lucky enough to find it open). There is a pool table in the games room, also available are free reading books (for when the English weather changes at a moments notice). There is ample leaflets on things to do,ie. cycle routes, kayaking, abbotsbury swannary. As for dogs being kept on a lead/under control, I do not think it is an unreasonable request, i think its commonsense in a public/communal area, some people (including my mum) are geniunely frightened of dogs. as for dog poo, dog owners would also not be best pleased if they or their children stepped in it and brought it into the tent/caravan/car. As a lone female traveller i feel very safe staying here as the owners live nearby the site. The site is very well located for Bournemouth, Poole, New Forest, Weymouth. You also have close by (walking distance if you are up for it) Monkey World, Bovington Tank Museum. The Village of Wool has a post office, spar, hairdressers, etc. which is a 10 min walk from site. 5min walk from site you have the railway station which takes you as far as London. There is also a bus stop at the railway station which takes you to Lyme Regis, Poole, West Bay, Weymouth.", "title": "Would Highly Recommend", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "newforestdrive", "date": "April 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 127508564}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Totally agree with previous reviewer.", "title": "Never again.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "dexterwilf", "date": "March 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"value": 1.0}, "id": 126643083}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "A very unwelcoming badly run campsite.
