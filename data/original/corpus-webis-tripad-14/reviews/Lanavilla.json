Decided to stay at Lanavilla based on TripAdvisor ratings, and we weren't disappointed. The villa is spacious, clean, well cared for, with smart bedrooms. Best of all, the host, Mic, is a charming host and gives such good recommendations for visits, cafes and restaurants. We would never have discovered the Kargeen Restaurant without his guidance (a splendid dining experience, and the staff even chased after us to return some cash to us as we'd made a mistake and left too much!) Nor would we have travelled the 30 minutes to the far side of the city to the Oman Diving Club, which is a wonderful beach club with pool, beach bar, good food, and the most fantastic beach with plenty of shade, and sheltered bay for gorgeous swimming. Again, this was our host's recommendation. He also gave us a fascinating insight into the history and culture of the city.", "title": "Great value and helpful host", "user": "Aztec_Tripper", "date": "November 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 85755095}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lanavilla, really good place to stay in Muscat!", "text": "The rooms facing to the front have a great view of the beach which is right across the road. We didn't try this particular beach, choosing instead the beach resort mentioned above. Rooms at the back are equally smart, albeit the view to the back is not appealing. But that's a small point. Breakfast was nicely presented and leisurely, with a wide choice available. We will certainly stay here again when we get the chance to visit this fascinating and beautiful city.", "user": "vopre", "date": "October 30, 2010", "id": 85362120}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you are looking for a new, cosy and cheap (for Oman) place to stay in Muscat near the beach. lanvilla is the place to go. The Villa is 100 M from the Ocean and beautiful. Also the location is quite central in Muscat. The staff very friendly and helpful...they even ask you what you want for breakfast (i guess only if it is not so busy there) and they serve fresh german bread there. Rooms are clean and comfortable....furniture looks very new (this is 2010).We happy reccomend Lanavilla to anyone.", "title": "Best choice in Muscat, ocean view, beach and great service", "user": "ScubaKurt", "date": "October 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 84315744}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "Heinz and Volker Stelter, Berlin", "title": "Cherry pick accomodation in Muscat", "user": "kvgiedre", "date": "October 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 83011120}], "location": {"country": "Oman", "region": "Muscat Governorate", "continent": "Middle East", "city": "Muscat"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 8, "very good": 32, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 134}, "aka": "Lanavilla Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.142857142857, "description": "Our popular Guesthouse B&B is located in Muscat on a quiet road by the BEACH.
