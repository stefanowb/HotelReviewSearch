The facility appeared to be brand new and clean. The rooms were well maintained and comfortable. There is a small business room off the lobby that had a computer with internet access and fax. A small fitness room was also available. The complementary breakfast was not elaborate, but was adequete for a light breakfast. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is in a new area - movie theater, Starbucks, pizza place all within walking distance. Very affordable. Would definetely stay here again.", "title": "Wonderful affordable hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "GFlorida", "date": "May 30, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 7715621, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 cleanliness, affordability, amenities", "disliked": "\u2014 fitness area was small"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Chino Hills"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 10, "very good": 27, "terrible": 6, "excellent": 40}, "aka": "Hampton Inn & Suites Chino Hills Hotel", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667}
