Normally with work I stay in 5 star hotels like the Hilton and the Intercontinental so its a change from them. The service I have had, spending my own money, has always been excellent. Staff ARE friendly in a Dutch (slightly less effusive than the Irish approach but probably more sincere) and if you ask for help they always respond (an attribute that is rare in most 5 star hotels). The rooms vary in size and rarely have en suite facilities. I think thats fair enough as the rooms maintain their 18th century proportions and a sense of coziness - it also keeps the price down for the economic!

Did an internet search for gay friendly Amsterdam lodging. It was easy to contact/pay online; response to my emails within 24 hours. The Hotel Golden Bear is located on a quiet street near the Leidsestraat, a major road with trendy and regular shops, fancy and pedestrian restaurants and both exclusive and inexpensive hotels. Dam Square is a 20 minute walk to the northeast and the Rijksmuseum is a 20 minute stroll to the southwest. Some rooms were being renovated and was originally told I might have to stay in a smoking room (which I did not want to do). Then I got a response informing me no matter what, I would get a no smoking room. Arrived to a typical multi-floor Amsterdam townhouse after taking a cab from the train station. The receptionist welcomed us and we put away our luggage until our room was ready (we had arrived at 10 am from Houston). The reception area and breakfast room were pleasant and we looked through tourist brochures that were available. We later walked up the small, spiral stairs (similar to those found on a ship). It was a bit difficult to move our bags up the stairway due to the space; however, when we got to our rooms we were very pleased. We were on the third floor and we had a shared shower and toilet on the second floor. The whole facility was very clean ... always with soap, toilet paper, beds made, etc. Each room was a nice size and had a double bed, tv, wash basin, closet, desk and chair. They were painted colorfully and had trendy Ikea-style furniture. My window looked to a wall but still allowed for nice cool air from the outside. My friend's looked to a courtyard below. The morning inclusive meal was hearty enough and consisted of meats, cheeses, rolls, toast, juice, coffee and other items. The receptionists were always helpful when giving us directions to places such as the drug store, restaurants, bars, the trolleys, etc. The price was reasonable and again, good location.", "title": "Cozy and Warm", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "justbstx", "date": "September 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8697820, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Great location and price, nice room size, pleasant staff and overall cleanliness.", "disliked": "\u2014 The traditional stars were very steep and there was a bit of mold in the closet (due to the damp Amsterdam weather)."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "There are probably better deals in Amsterdam.
