Night market, pub alley are less than a 5 minute walk away and opposite there is a small supermarket to stock up on water and other essentials, plenty of tour operators to organize your trip to Angkor Wat and even an optician. The hotel has no elevator (at least I did not see it) so be prepared to haul your bag up the stairs (or let the staff do it and feel guilty). Rooms are decorated in what I would call Khmer baroque which looked nice on the website but is a bit impractical in reality. Having the shower in the middle of the room took some getting used to and there was not enough space around the sink for my toiletries. My room was close to the pool area which was fantastic and also had a tiny balcony with a view. Despite the central location, there was no noise. Everything worked perfectly and there is a coffee maker with nescafe which is great as Cambodian coffee is not the greatest in the world. The wifi signal was weak occasionally but the staff did their best to assist, the restaurant is nice, good food, reasonable prices and nice cocktails.
