There's plenty of young families and noise but that's why it's great. Lots of activity, lots of space and backed with an extensive menu for a great Sunday afternoon. The food we ordered was good. I was really impressed with the staff. Ordered a beer and they had to change the keg, but rather than me wait he brought it to the table, remember it was busy, great service. The food came out at different times exactly as we asked. We will definitely be back.", "user": "MBarr", "date": "July 16, 2013", "id": 167749029}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good pub and let the kids enjoy", "text": "The food was ok and not too much of a rip off. About $28 for a nice steak. The best thing is the playground.

Each time I have been it has been really busy and each time I have had the same experience with the kids play rooms. There is literally 40-50 kids going crazy and this last time - 2 Parents - watching the children. All younger children left within about 5 mins crying as they were pushed and shoved by older children going wild, running the wrong way up the slides, pushing eachother off equipment etc. I will not go to Belrose Hotel again now and will not recommend it if you have young children. It is just too damn dangerous. I cross fingers and wish no ill on any child but it is only a matter of time before a child is seriously hurt there.", "title": "The Kids Play areas are just plain dangerous and kids are not monitored", "user": "Billingt2n", "date": "February 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 151277615}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "decent food, great venue", "text": "Took some clients to lunch there.
