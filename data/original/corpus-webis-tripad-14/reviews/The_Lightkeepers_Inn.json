It is very well equipped (they even provide half-n-half in the refrigerator) and it is exceptionally clean. You feel as though you were the first peson to stay there. The two drawbacks to this location are that it's about 6 feet from the road that serves as overflow for cars trying to get on the Chappy ferry. The other is that it's an old house and sound carries easily. I imagine the second floor in the back is probably the quietest location -- if I come here again, I'll try booking the cottage or Suite 5; after that I'd choose a room in descending order, Suite 1 being the noisiest. They do everything within their power to make it a delightful stay.

Everything was perfect. Everything is quality, and everything is incredibly clean. All this thanks to our gracious Innkeeper Pat and her staff, whom it's clear put great importance in all of the above. We even misbooked our stay, accidently booking the cottage for the following weekend. It was our error, not the Inn's, however we were accommodated without delay or any of the issues you might otherwise encounter with another inn or motel. In fact, upon our arrival, I was very surprised to find a box of Chilmark Chocolates (only available on the west-side of the island, we were told) and a postcard wishing me a happy birthday. Now that's fantastic service! And fantastic chocolate, btw.

But then I had the worst night's sleep of my life. We stayed in the Cape Pogue Suite, on the ground floor towards the back, and just outside the bedroom window was the loudest ice machine imaginable -- so loud it might as well have been in the room, and totally unnecessary, as each room has its own fridge with ice trays. I spent eight hours listening to the machine go on and off (when I reached my limit & turned it off around 1.30, someone turned it back on half an hour later), when not distracted by every sound made by the couple in the room above, or by the very bouncy mattress which meant that every time my husband moved, I woke up. And I'm not a light sleeper. And after a long sleepless night, there was no hint of breakfast, which made for a strange contradiction between motor-lodge experience and boutique hotel prices. We chose the Lightkeeper's inn because of the great reviews on this site, but having seen the other hotels in Edgartown (the Harborview, Edgartown Inn etc.), all of which had better September rates, I'm kicking myself.
