This would be the best choice if this is your first time ink Los Angeles and you are not driving. This is because the heart is in a convenient location where by taxi it is around 10-20 mins taxi to most places in Los Angeles such as downtown, warner brothers, Griffith observatory, Beverly Hills, universal etc. However, if you are going to have a car in Los Angeles, and it will be convenient for you to get around by yourself, Hollywood the area it self is extremely touristy and not the best place to be at night as there are plenty of weirdos hanging around.

Sound between the rooms is pretty loud. The room next to us could be heard talking on what appeared to the phone as we only heard half of the conversation.
