My husband had developed a problem with his knee several days earlier, and was on crutches, so an alternate room was organised on the first floor. This meant that he did not have to use the stairs as there is street level access at the back of the hotel. They also organised an appointment with a doctor, supplied cups of tea and coffee for us, and were most solicitous for his welfare. We would love to return and spend time exploring Chinon when he is able to walk around, and also enjoy again the excellent hospitality of Francoise, Laurent and Martine.
