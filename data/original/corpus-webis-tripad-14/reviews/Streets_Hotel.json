We hadn't been to Paris since before our kids were born, and we wanted to experience something that would remind us of what we were like when we were young. So we booked the Murano Resort which is in the trendiest part of town (Le Marais) and caters to a twenty to thirty-something crowd. I have to say - it was a wonderful hotel. Beautiful, modern, just like an architectural design showcase. It was expensive, but so is Paris generally. But to be honest, we really think this place is better suited for younger tourists, and I fear that all but the most adventurous 50-something tourists like us would feel more comfortable elsewhere. For example, the hallways were lit by \"black lights\" - the kind that used to make our fluorescent posters glow in the 1970s. Although we thought this was so creative and interesting, our middle-aged eyes weren't quite able to see where we were going. More than anything, we learned on this trip that as happy as we were to be young once, we think we'll let the younger generation enjoy the stuff that's geared towards them!
