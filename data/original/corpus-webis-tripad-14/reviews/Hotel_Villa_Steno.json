The hotel is located in the old town of Moterosso on a hill with stunning views. Take a taxi from the train station. You don't want to lug your luggage up their steep driveway. The hotel is very clean with spectacular views from each room. Mateo and his wife, as well as Vanessa, could not have been sweeter or more helpful. They were the most gracious hosts. Wonderful people!! The location was perfect with great cafes just a minute or two walk down from the hotel. I would stay there again and again!

I have been there with my three adult children, a best friend, with just my youngest daughter and this year by myself. Every time has been the same... the warm hospitality and inviting nature of Carla and Matteo, the owners, immediately makes you feel that you are welcome to their home, not \"just a hotel.\" Every room has been perfect for the number of people who occupied it. The air conditioning has always been most welcome on some of the very warm and humid days but as the evening comes on and the temperature cools, it is so very pleasant to sit outside on a balcony, take in the gorgeous views and hear music at times from \"downtown.\" Everything is sparkling clean and the staff very friendly and warm. Any information needed about the area...trails, a good restaurant, train and boat schedules, even where to buy lettuce.. are easily handled by the staff and you are provided with a wonderful packet about the hotel and surrounding areas when you check in. Breakfast is fabulous with a HUGE spread of breads, sweets, meats, cheeses, yogurt, cereals, homemade marmalades, juices, and any coffee drink you could possibly want. As I always drive to Monterosso it is wonderful to have parking during my stay as finding parking in or near this town is nearly impossible. This year I extended my visit a little bit and per usual, even this wasn't long enough.
