We expected the rooms to be small, which they were, but the beds were very comfortable and the sheets & towels were changed every day. The rooms were air conditioned and had all tea & coffee making faclities, trouser press, hairdryer, mini bar etc. The staff were really friendly and helpful in recommending eating places etc. Included in the price was an American buffet breakfast which, although the same every day, there was plenty to choose from. This made a good start to the day as eating out wasn't particularly cheap. Our favourite eating place was recommended by a taxi driver and if you like seafood then pay a visit to Brasserie Bofinger on 5-7 Rue de la Bastille.", "title": "Great hotel in great location", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "Jaxes", "date": "August 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5614006, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel Duminy Vendome is redeemed by its fantastic location and spacious rooms.

We had heard stories of how small all the hotels in Paris are, but we had a king-sized bed and plenty of room. We did upgrade one room class, so this probably helped out with the size, while adding very little to the cost. The main benefit of this hotel is the fantastic location - it is a few blocks from the Louvre and right across the street from the Jardins des Tuileries. We were able to walk to several areas - the Latin Quater, Notre Dame, Musee d'Orsay, to name a few. We also had breakfast included with our room rate, which saved us quite a bit of money.
