There are 3 rooms to select from: Red, Green or Blue. We stayed in the Blue Room which has a large en-suite shower and bathroom, and rear balcony overlooking the beautiful garden Mary tends. It also overlooks a local church and you are awoken by birdsong and church bells. The Blue Room was spacious, clean and every other day you are provided with fresh fluffy white towels. There are tea/coffee facilities, a fridge for fresh milk and a large plasma TV screen/DVD player. The lounge has a selection of up to date magazines, newspapers and DVD's to choose from. Breakfast is from 0800-0900 and your request is submitted the evening before for cooked food - additionally there are cereals, yoghurt, fresh fruit and a selection of fresh juices. Breakwater House is situated right on Bude Canal so you are in an excellent spot to drive the coastal road to Widemouth Bay (try Elements restaurant for dinner - it has fantastic views), you are steps away from Summerleaze Beach with soft sand, rocks to clamber over or a spot of seaside dining at Life's a Beach, or to walk into Bude town which has a multitude of quaint gift and seaside style shops. The UK weather was extremely kind during our stay - not a spot of rain - so we also visited Tintagel Castle (10 miles approx) and Boscastle (7 miles approx) both worth a mention. Another tip - if you are visiting Padstow, drive to Rock, park your car and take the ferry there in 5 minutes - but arrive before the tide goes out or you'll be walking half a mile down the beach!
