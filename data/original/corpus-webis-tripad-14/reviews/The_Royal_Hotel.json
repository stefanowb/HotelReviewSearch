The TV had been bashed in on the corner and the bathroom was 1970's decor & fittings with tiles fallen off revealing 1960's wallpaper underneath. The 1970's shower dribbled & it was impossible to wash properly. The room was gloomy due to inadequate lighting and I had to prop the mirror on magazines to be able to see in it.
