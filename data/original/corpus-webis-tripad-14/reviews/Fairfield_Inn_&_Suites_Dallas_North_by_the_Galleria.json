Thanks to TripAdvisor, we decided to try this hotel for our 5-day January trip. The staff was very helpful the entire stay, but they went above-and-beyond at check-in. They actually lowered our internet rate by $10; that never happened before! They also offered to move us to another floor for our last day, when a teen bus group arrived. We declined their offer, but it seemed they were always looking out for us. Their breakfast was juice, waffles, bagels, yogurt, cereal, and apples. The breakfast room was kept stocked and clean, and had a large flat-screen TV. Every morning a free USA Today was placed at our door. Our room was super clean, as was the exercise room with a big flat screen TV. Both beds in our room were excellent, and there were big and small pillow choices. We were few blocks from all the restaurants on Belt Line Road; a big plus. The area was very safe and quiet, with an upscale condo across the street. We also liked how easy it was to get around with LBJ freeway, Midway Road, and Spring Valley Road easy connections to any direction.

The only bathroom amenity provided was a bar of soap and shampoo. Breakfast bar was very good and attendant kept it stocked and clean. In fact, the breakfast bar attendant was the biggest help during my stay. I had a flat tire and she went out of her way to tell me the closest place to get it fixed and she called to see if it was open on Sunday and what time it opened!
