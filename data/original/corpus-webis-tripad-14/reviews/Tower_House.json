The building is old and attractive and is well furnished in keeping with the style of the property. I found my room to be very comforatable. However, it is important to bear in mind that this is a limited service establishment - no room service, no lounge or bar for guests and continental breakfasts are the only meal provided. As there are countless places to eat and drink close by the limitations were no problem. Like some other reviewers, I thought the electric shower was poor. However, unlike one reviewer I found the place to be spotlessly clean. Quality accommodation is in short supply in central Oxford so nowhere is cheap but I would say this provides a relatively good value and friendly option.", "user": "Blackstone", "date": "February 1, 2011", "id": 95173987}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Over Priced and Hotel needs to be taken from the title its a B+B!!", "text": "The room itself was nice, the shower was poor it was a trickle at best, when you pay \u00a3120 pounds a night you would expect better value for money it isnt but on the plus side it was in a good location", "user": "YOGIMACK", "date": "January 24, 2011", "id": 94258625}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "helpful and central but not very clean", "text": "This is a bed and breakfast.

I stayed one flight of stairs up in the Jade Room with private bathroom. The room was a nice size, clean with a comfortable bed. The Tower Hotel is in the center of town, the plus side is I could walk to everything, the downside is the noise at night, but I was so tired I didn't mind.
