It was the perfect late spring getaway and after 4 days we felt pleasantly bored. The weather was in the 80's every day (just a bit humid) and the water was warm. It's a small but beautiful resort with less than 50 rooms and it never felt crowded. The pool is nice and there are tons of lounge chairs, however the actual beachfront is fairly short so while you can go in the water, it's not the place for long strolls down the beach (unless you want to go back and forth). The rooms are nice and spacious, however the bed was a bit on the firm side and the sheets were rough (or maybe I was sunburned!) for the type of place that seems like it should be obsessed with it's high thread-count. The staff is friendly and helpful. The mango daiquiries are fantastic! The restaurant is a bit over-priced and the menu never changes so plan to explore local places. You might check out a local seafood shack that we heard was good but never made it to, and ditto a nearby Italian restaurant. We did go to a great and really cheap restaurant nearby called La Loma that has terrific Mexican food and $1 beers (as opposed to $6 at the resort). A Brazilian steak place across the street from La Loma is supposed to be good and cheap as well. You'll need a car to get to these last 2 restaurants as they are about 15 min away by car. If possible, try to fly into Manzanillo airport and rent a car there. It's an easy 1 hr. drive -- as opposed to the 3 hr. ride from PV -- and then you don't have to pay for taxis etc. if you want to eat elsewhere.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "sarah m", "date": "May 23, 2006", "id": 5203842}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2006", "text": "My boyfriend and I stayed at El Careyes for a much needed vacation during the second week of March.

Even with the excellent reviews on here, our expectations were surpassed! The hotel grounds are truly beautiful, the service was exemplary, and the place is very peaceful. The hotel was full when we arrived because they had a wedding. Many of the guests checked out on our second day there, and as the hotel was no longer full, we were offered to switch rooms to a beautiful suite with a big terrace overlooking the pool and ocean. There were many other nice touches regarding the service - remembering our names, quick responses to requests, nice surprises with the turndown service. The food at the hotel was quite good, and the Playa Rosa restaurant (5 minute walk) serves excellent seafood and fresh fish in a beautiful atmosphere. There is also a beachside \"fish hut\" a 15 minute walk from the hotel that serves $1- beers and inexpensive fish that were brought in by fisherman that same day. We flew into Manzanillo and rented a car - the drive to the resort was 1h 30m, and not bad at all. The bathrooms are a bit small, but they are also very clean and functional. This place doesn't have a lot of bling luxury (huge marble washrooms, designer furniture) - but at the same time, it feels very comfortable and special.

The hotel and Playa Rosa take credit cards, but if you want to eat at the fish hut, buy alcohol in town, or go to any other local restaurants you will need local currency.

We were looking for a nice, quiet place to relax and unwind after all the wedding stress and Careyes exceeded all of our expectations. The resort is beautiful, with lush scenery, fantastic views, and breathtaking sunsets. The service was fantastic, the staff was very attentive and a lot of fun to talk to, even giving my wife spanish lessons when she tried to remember her high school level spanish. We flew into Puerto Vallarta and drove to El Careyes, which was an easy hour and a half to two hour drive. When we arrived at El Carayes they met us at the front desk with cold drinks and cold compress towels. Then they led us up to our Junior Ocean Front suite. It was a fantastic room, very spacious, with a nice king bed and a very cool porch that had a private plunge pool and a fantastic view out onto the bay. The bathroom was nice and big with a great two person shower, which was nice. The food was fantastic, with a lot of fresh seafood and good mexican cuisine. We were a little concerned over the fact that September is in the middle of the off/rainy season, but we found that for the most part it rained in the evenings/night and although it was hot, it was nice and sunny in the afternoon. The other nice part of being there in September was that there were maybe six other couples at the resort, so it really felt like you had the place to yourself. The only downside to the entire experience was that the beach was a little rocky, but the huge pool was right off the beach and great to relax by.
