Since we'd been in Europe for several weeks in B&B's and smaller boutique hotels, we were looking for somewhere with decent sized rooms and good Internet service. We got the decent sized room but the Internet service was horrible and cost 25 euros/day. That combined with the prices they charge for food, drinks and parking made this not the most pleasant stay. Plus there isn't much in the way of restaurants to walk to from here and breakfast was - are you sitting down?- 29 euros for the buffet, 19 euros if you just have the continental buffet. It's more of a business hotel. So stay here if you've been in Europe a while and need to feel the comforts of an American hotel room but otherwise I'd stay somewhere else closer to town. I will say that the staff at the front desk was very efficient and helpful with the Internet problems.
