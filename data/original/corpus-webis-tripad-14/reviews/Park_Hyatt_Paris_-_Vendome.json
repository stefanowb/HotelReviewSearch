We were also provided with complimentary breakfast in the beautiful restaurant, where the service was superb and the food array was both artistically displayed and delicious. The location was, of course, excellent, at the Place Vendome, which was convenient both to the Opera Metro station and the Roissy bus to the airport.

The other negative was there seemed to be a smoky smell in our room and on our towels when we returned for the last portion of our trip.

We splurged and stayed here the first few nights of our Paris visit (celebrating a wedding anniversary) in mid October. Luxurious and posh, yet truly comforting. It would be tough not to spot a celebrity or rockstar in the mix. We could not fully appreciate what the 'palace' distinction the Park Hyatt Vendome received meant...we do now. Surrounded by incredible art, craftsmanship, and thoughtful amenities, it's the opulence of Paris but up close and personal. Polished mahogany walls and handmade furniture! Our room was spacious and overlooked a courtyard, and the bathroom with its limestone, powerful rainfall shower, and Blaise Mautin products spoiled me forever. One of my favorite room features: the tall french windows (three sets!) which opened to the most peaceful courtyard. No noise whatsoever. I mean the hotel is located on Peace Street, can you beat it? English speaking staff who resemble movie stars did not hurt one bit. We had breakfast at Les Orchidees--and do NOT assume it is a typical hotel buffet! Omg it was incredible. I highly recommend it (again, a bit of a splurge). Lastly, the spa! What a true urban retreat that soothed us after all the walking and sensory overload.
