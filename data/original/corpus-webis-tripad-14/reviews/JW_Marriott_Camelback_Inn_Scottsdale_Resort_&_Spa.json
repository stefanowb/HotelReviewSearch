This was definitely the best Priceline deal we've ever had. We both loved everything about the resort. We were given a huge room with a private patio and a view of Camelback Mountain. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful, especially the concierge and room service employee, Fitzroy. The grounds are absolutely stunning. We rented bikes from the bell desk for an hour and just rode around the property (it was too hot to go further). We saw about twenty species of birds, including quail and different kinds of hummingbirds. Even though this is a high-end resort, it did not feel at all stuffy. Everyone was dressed very casually, including at the on-site restaurant. One tip: the packaged Starbucks coffee by the coffee maker is not free, and you will incur a mini-bar charge if you use it. I would recommend this resort to anyone and hope to return soon. The ongoing renovations did not detract from our experience in the least. The temporary lobby is very charmingly done.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "shario", "date": "September 24, 2007", "id": 10000127}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed here as part of our honeymoon trip touring california/nevada/arizona/hawaii. With the exception of the luxor in vegas, this was my favourite hotel out of 12. We booked through skoosh and paid about \u00a350 for one night which I thought was excellent value for money. The property was fairly empty at this time(perhaps due to the heat?). Although it is located more than walking distance from bars/restaurants i really liked the luxurious feel of the casitas. The room was tastefully decorated, it looked very new actually. it also had a fantastic aircon system and the bed, wow. The bed was quite possibly the nicest bed i have ever slept in ever, a real comfort when you have been travelling long distances and are tired out. The construction did not impact on our stay whatsoever, please don't let this put you off. The pool area is clean and tidy and they come round frequently to get you drinks/towels etc. As this was a one night stopover we didn't get to sample many of the other resort facilities so i can't comment on those. My only gripe was with the restaurant, we had particularly bad service in the restuarant near to the pool, in particular the waitress taking a long time to get us things/take our order but i wouldnt let this put you off either.
