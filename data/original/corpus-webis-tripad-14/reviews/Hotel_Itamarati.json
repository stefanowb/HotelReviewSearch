It has a great location, and whilst it's definitely quite dated in it's decor, this adds to it's character. The fridge was so old that it actually looked pretty retro cool!! Having said that, everything works, it's clean, plenty spacious enough and staff are great. Free internet in the lobby and easy to get to the main attractions. I would recommend this too!", "title": "Cheap and retro!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "FayeW", "date": "May 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 7695623, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Doors locked but didn't look all that secure, however, there is a safe in the room."}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2006, traveled on business", "text": "I've stayed at this hotel a few different times since 2002. As the reviewer above notes, a few spots are in need of some paint, but overall it's a good hotel...or a great hotel given the prices in SP. I paid about $50 for a double room in Jan. 2006. Rooms and bathrooms are good-sized and very clean. The people who work there are friendly and helpful. The lobby and facade are charming, and the Praca do Republica is a block away...I'd recommend this hotel.", "title": "Good hotel!", "user": "batty33", "date": "July 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5460416}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good Clean Budget Hotel", "text": "The Hotel Itamarati lies close to the geograhical centre of Sao Paulo.
