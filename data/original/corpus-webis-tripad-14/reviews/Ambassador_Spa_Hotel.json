I also booked because of the pool, but it turned out my grandson could only use between 8am - 9am!!! or 5pm - 6pm, and I needed to accompany him. It was OK though as we did two 5-6's which was fine. The breakfasts were great, entirely self service, which needed to be constantly re-filled, but we managed a good feed. (perhaps more staff to oversee when things need replenishing?).

We were not disappointed. He booked a room with a sea view and that is exactly what we got. The room was equipped with tea/coffee facility so it was lovely after our drive to the hotel, to relax with a coffee enjoying the beautiful view from our room window. The hotel has a zen garden with a sauna. There is a relaxation room which my partner and I enjoyed after having a shoulder and back massage. Whilst enjoying the peace and relaxing ambiance of the relaxation room you can have cocktails brought to the room via room service. There is plenty of choice for breakfast which is served in a tastefully decorated dining room. Check out time of 10am was a little early we thought however we asked the staff if we could extend our leaving time to 11.30am and there was no problem or charge for this. During our stay I was disappointed that there was a problem with the swimming pool and therefore I was unable to have an early morning swim before breakfast on the day that we were leaving. As we were checking our we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay and I mentioned my disappointment with the pool and immediately we were told that now that the problem with the pool had been resolved we were most welcome to stay and enjoy this facility. We thought this was a lovely gesture however we had already made arrangements for the rest of the day. Car parking was in the street outside of the hotel but this was free as the hotel provides its guest with a disc to display in their car to cover all of the stay. The hotel do pamper day packages and I shall certainly be returning for one of these.

We always opt for a sea view as the views are truly stunning. Despite some refurbishment and the introduction of a spa, we won't be returning again. As mentioned in other reviews the toilets in the downstairs corridor do smell dreadful, and there is no attention to detail regarding the cleanliness of the rooms. We asked for a sea view room and were put in a small double room (I think it was 315) which was cramped and very small and dark, we requested and paid for an upgrade to a larger bay window room which was great, although the shower is not powerful and the temperature a little hit and miss. However the main reason why we won't be returning again is that the breakfast options are limited and is now fully self service, you even have to toast your own bread and make a cup of tea!!. This arrangement leads to long delays depending on the time to decide to go for breakfast as you wait for the toaster, or queue up for hot food or to make tea etc. Part of the enjoyment of being on holiday is having a delicious breakfast served at your table and having menu choices. Finally I would ask where has the customer service gone? We stayed 3 nights, and only once did a member of restaurant staff wish us a 'good morning', the others avoided eye contact and no-one smiled!
