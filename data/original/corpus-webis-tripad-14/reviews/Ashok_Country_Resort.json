The first thing you notice on entering the hotel is the musty smell. The furnishings in the rooms are very old and shabby. The shower is over the bath but the bath was filthy so not a good experience. The bed felt damp. The power points didn't look safe and I was scared to charge anything. We were told there was free internet but didn't work the whole time we were there.

It appears that the majority of rooms are similar both on ground and 1st floor. Our ground floor room was spacious with a comfortable bed although a higher pillow would have been a plus. Outlook from our room was into the rear of a decaying building but it wasn't a major issue. Staff were helpful and courteous. We took advantage of the hotel car and driver at a reasonable rate to visit some of Delhi's attractions. There is a good restaurant upstairs too. We were disappointed not to be able to book a room here at the end of our Indian visit 5 weeks later due to wedding function at the hotel.", "title": "A Delhi oasis", "user": "LynneandMick", "date": "October 30, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 183005341}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled solo", "text": "Only 20 minutes from the airport.As I had to move to Bengaluru very early next morning, it was the point.", "title": "No hot warter", "user": "makikomizushina", "date": "October 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 180757023}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2013, traveled with family", "text": "But I did not imagine that hot water never came in such expensive hotel like this.", "title": "Skip this one", "user": "dale456562", "date": "October 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 179410180}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "and the light was dark, my bet was wet.", "title": "Better avoid", "user": "World_travel242013", "date": "August 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173009027}], "location": {"country": "India", "continent": "Asia", "city": "New Delhi"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 31, "average": 49, "very good": 46, "terrible": 17, "excellent": 12}, "aka": "Ashok Country Hotel New Delhi", "slim_ranking": 0.395622895623}
