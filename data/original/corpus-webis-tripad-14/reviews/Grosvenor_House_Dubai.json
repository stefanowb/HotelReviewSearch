That is when we decided to complain. I spoke to the assistant front house manager about the problems and with no arguments we were offered to move to a new room with the marina view, surprisingly they had upgraded us to a 1bedroom apartment. The apartment was on the 39th flour so the noise problems were solved. The only problem with our apartment 3912 was that the bathroom was not as good as the one in the deluxe room, there was no separate shower, the shower was hand healed and was in the tub, for some one who is use to taking a shower with jets at home this is a big disappointment, I didn't want to complain again as I felt they had done to much by giving us the apartment.

The staff were generally good and food was excellent but having stayed at 6 other hotels in Dubai this is to be expected. There's many problems in our opinion though with this hotel. Our first problem encountered was trying to get ice delivered to your room, on one occasion we waited for 20 mins whereas many hotels we've stayed at in Dubai the staff seem to know your habits and have ice ready upon your return to the room. Another surprise was none of the hotel bars served draught beer which is unheard of at 5 star hotels in Dubai. A nice cold beer at the pool?? Forget it at the Grosvenor, you'll be lucky to get much better than a slightly cold bottle. Make sure you get down to breakfast early as you may face a long delay, as previously stated, the hotel caters for many business conferences etc so much of the dining space is often taken by business types rather than hotel guests. The hotel has internet access in the business centre which is free to use but don't get excited as it was virtually useless with speeds worse than dial up. Perhaps the worst thing about this hotel was the pool. Some bright architect decided to place the pool on the 4th of a 44 floor hotel which meant sunbathing was finished at around 1pm and than it was a battle for a beds on just one side as the sun passed over the hotel. Considering this hotel is not near the beach then i find this incredible. The other option is to climb into the free shuttle bus to the sister hotel le royal meridien about 5 mins away. Perhaps the worst feature of this hotel is the surrounding building work and noise which, expected anywhere in Dubai is by far and away worse than ever at this hotel. Day and night the noise was unrelenting with cranes literally swinging over you at the pool!
