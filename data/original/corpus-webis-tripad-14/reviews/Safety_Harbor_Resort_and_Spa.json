This recent visit, Sept 21st was my second one and once again I just cannot say enough good things. Room was clean, beds so comfortable, patio furniture clean and comfortable too. I am a Pinellas county resident so this was a staycation for me. Three lovely days and nights. The foods experience in the evening was wonderful, two nights had steak and they were cooked to my temperature preference on the first try. Chicken Piccatta the last evening was light and fresh tasting and the presentation was lovely.", "user": "Travelstepper", "date": "September 4, 2013", "id": 175750698}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Service to our Country Visit", "text": "We of course enjoyed the Spa facilities, all areas clean tidy, well kept, staff professional.", "user": "Janice G", "date": "August 29, 2013", "id": 174593981}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fabulous place for girls getaway!", "text": "One cautionary note, check out spa operation hours.

The same day at night we were trying to go to sleep but we couldn't because they had a band or something down stairs playing some kind of music which didn't sound like music to us but they had it so loud things were bouncing off the wall.

We can't say enough about the friendly staff, especially Mr. Richko who helped us plan our stay and made sure our accomodations were nothing but first rate. He truly went above and beyond to make sure we were completely taken care of and, as a rarity these days, seemed to thoroughly enjoy his job in doing so. We enjoyed the beautiful view, restaurant and the quintessential small city location with fun shops and views all around. The brunch was delicious and of a caliber comparable to much more expensive gourmet restaurants. Be sure to have the bread pudding with caramel sauce, it's a treat you won't soon forget.

The management does not take the necessary actions to rectify the consequential mold. The building temperature throughout the resort and spa is extremely cold to attempt to keep the mold at bay. My labor day retreat was a bust as the prior day flooding had exacerbated the mold problem. While the spa services are good, the mold and musty spa environment triggered my allergic reaction. By 4pm when I got to my room in the Olympia tower, I started coughing and wheezing. Attempts to reduce mold reaction with the in-room dehumidifier unit were unsuccessful. As much as I did not want to leave, my breathing was belabored and I could not stay any longer. Moving to another room was not an option as the problem exists throughout all the resort buildings. As I checked out at 6pm, the same day as arrival, the front desk woman asked me to call back after the labor day weekend when a manager would be present. I willingly paid for the spa services delivered. The result...a ridiculous $27 refund on a $200 room. I will never go there again.
