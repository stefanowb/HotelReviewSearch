The views were wonderful, as an exhibitor for a conference it was an awful venue. If you want a rustic room in a wooded setting this is it, if you want a hotel like experience stay somewhere else. The meals were good, the service average to poor, timing was a bit tricky one hour for lunch and dinner two hours for breakfast, the times conflicted with the conference exhibit hours. No TV in the room was a nice rustic touch, pool tables and board games in the main lodge, a few in our cabin too.
