Every single one of us -- males and females, large and thin -- all complained about cold. The in-room thermostats need calibrated. Each one of us needed to raise of thermostats to the upper-80s to even be able to take our jackets off. Not only that, but as we raised the thermostats, the heater didn't even kick on.
