The hotel lobby and bar are the best bits of this hotel. The rooms and other areas are getting very tired and in need of a refurb. My room smelt distinctly musty and damp when I walked into it. The air conditioning was dripping water on the floor and there was a damp patch on the carpet underneath which probably explained the smell. It suggested that there was a general lack of maintenance and the room was really quite worn in other areas too like the wallpaper coming off the walls around the window area. Food was distinctly average. Much of the buffet breakfast and lunches were very dated in content and presentation (think 1970's), and quite often the hot items were allowed to go cold and not very nice. The bar staff were quite unfriendly and it seemed deliberately slow if you dared to try and attract their attention.", "title": "More like the Smellia Lebreros", "user": "Trav-london", "date": "October 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 142611295}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Tired but ok for business", "text": "Just spent three nights at the hotel.
