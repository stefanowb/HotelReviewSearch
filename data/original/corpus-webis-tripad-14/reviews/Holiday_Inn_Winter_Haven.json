It is also close to restaurants & shopping. The hotel is very clean. We have stayed here a few times when visiting Legoland, when the Hampton Inn was booked. We prefer that hotel. Holiday Inn doesn't offer free breakfast, which we like for the kids. I take my grandchildren down as I am an early riser, & let Mom, Dad & Grandpop sleep a little later.
