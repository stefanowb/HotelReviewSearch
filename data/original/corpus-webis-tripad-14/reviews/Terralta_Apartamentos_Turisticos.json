Well i neednt have worried as on arrival we were greeted by polite staff and shown to our room immediatey which was immaculately clean and tidy with plenty of space for the three of us. The pool area was just as impressivee cleaned every night, large with plenty of loungers and a little play park. There is a steep hill separting the apartment frm the nearest store and a brave walk into the centre of benidorm. But there is buses hourly from right outside the apts and again coming back so u are able to avoid it. There is a small shop on site for bits n bobs too.

Travelled with 2 friends for long weekend away. Had never been to Benidorm before so didn't know what to expect - Terralta did not disappoint - we knew it was a little out of the way, but we didn't want to be totally in the middle of the hussle and bussle but near enough when we wanted to party. The pool is great (was abit cold but it was beg Oct - though the weather was fantastic), apartment was very clean, big and well equipped - massive balconey and I found the beds very comfy - even the sofa's (which turned into bed when the backing pillows taken off) were big and comfortable. We only at once at the hotel, lunch was ok, so can't comment too much about that. Reception staff very helpful and honestly could not fault this place, I would return definately. Took about 15 minutes walk down into the Old Town (which is lovely, great shopping, lovely atmosphere) - another 15 minutes stroll along the beach and your in the lively new town - it's buzzing and we did have some great meals and lots of shows, bars etc. Chinese buffet was great - can't remember the name of the restaurant but it was only 4.50 Euro's for 3 course meal and half bottle of wine! Enjoyed cocktails at the Comedy Club too. The Terralta was great for what we wanted - a relaxing girls weekend, good base for shopping and near enough to the resort we could walk to or hop into a taxi (9 Euro), not too long transfer from the airport and clean and comfortable apartment with friendly staff.", "title": "TERRALTA WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME, I WOULD RECOMMEND", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "TheEllisFamily21", "date": "November 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 120566344}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Visited here in mid October, 2 adults 2 kids, The apartments were large enough for a family of 4. Clean and tidy and well maintained. Air conditioning was working and came on every 2 hours or so. The pool was big clean but as it was October it was a bit chilly, but the kids went storming in any way!!!. We went self catering so went to the small supermarket in the complex. Prices were higher than the ones down the street but it was ok to get some essentials till we found our feet (bread, milk, butter). We had breakfast a few times but found it to be expensive, about 25euros, so we bought food and cerial and cooked breakfast and lunch in the apartments saving a lot of cash, which freed up cash for dinners both in the restraunt both in the hotel and other outside places. The hill is not a massive climb but a wee incline that should be easy for most people. A bus runs from right outside and is every hour on the hour and costs 1.35euros and takes you right into the heart of benidorm and can drop you off near the \"British Strip\". The nearest supermarket is a walk down the hill, (staying on the same side as the apartments) about 400m away and prices are a lot cheaper than the in-store supermarket, I stocked up with a few bottles of San Miguel and Amstel. The bar prices are reasonable and when your at the pool its nice to sup a cold one while enjoying the sun. Happy hour is from 9pm-10:30, and is a very good deal 2 for 1. One thing we were not too impressed with was the \"Reptile show\", 3 people came along with 4 big boxes, pulled out some snakes to show the audience, walked around, let them feel the snake, then it was back in the box. They pulled out a massive albino python and asked if anyone wanted a photo, a lot of people said yes, they started putting snakes around everyone and started taking photos. I asked a few times how much and eventually found it was 20EUROS!!!! No way was i paying that. It became clear they were on a money making exercise.
