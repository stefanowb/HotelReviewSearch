It was 4 courses and all western, there was no Sri Lankan food at all which was a disappointment. Our starter of a prawn salad had one prawn on it, which was overcooked and chewy. The second started was vegetable soup, but this was merely veg stock. Then the main course or with pork or fish looked terribly haute cuisine ie not much to eat! It lacked flavour aswell. The dessert was nothing special. We actually went back to our rooms feeling very hungry! Breakfast the next morning looked promising, but all the cooked foods like eggs, bacon etc were stone cold. I asked the chef for toast but the waiter delivered it to the wrong table.
