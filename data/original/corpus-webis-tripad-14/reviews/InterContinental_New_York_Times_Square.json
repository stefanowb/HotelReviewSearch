The hotel was quite beautiful, but some of their setup decisions made the stay less comfortable rather than more. The lobby was very sleek, but that sleek desk left only enough space for two workers - not nearly enough to efficiently check in the volume of conferees trying to check in. When I got the room, I did my usual scoping of the room, including the mini-bar. One of the boxes was not as readily labelled as the others so I picked it up to see what it was - turned out to be a \"Passion Kit.\" I only then saw the sign that anything picked up from the tray would automatically be charged to the room. Oops, didn't want that showing up on the bill when I do my expense report. It took 2 calls to reception (I was hung up on once) and talking to 3 (THREE!) people to get the charge removed. The cool modern sink has a design flaw in that the towel bar is located under the sink, leading to lots of forgetting to get the towel before I washed my hands and getting myself wet grasping for the towel afterward. Also, while the straight-down shower was cool looking, it also made it inconvenient to adjust the water temperature before fully getting in (my boss ended up drenching herself, fully clothed, because she didn't notice the setup in time). Lastly, they have a computer in the room, which is cool, until you realize you need to pay if you intend to use it to do basic things like check your email. So, a big chunk of desk space ended up being taken up by something I never used. If you're a big fan of obnoxiously modern decor you'll probably love this hotel, but I just found it a bit annoying.", "title": "Form over function", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "parslane", "date": "September 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 118717119}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We have stayed here a few times and we are always very happy.

It is a great location (walking distance to nearly everything, and on the quieter side of Times Square, more towards Hell's Kitchen), decent sized rooms, and nice staff. I very much enjoyed the concierge team and they were fantastic at pointing us in the right direction for restaurants. They do have some \"sneaky charges\" like having a computer in the room, but charging you to use it (that isn't made clear), and leaving water and snacks out with no real sign to say how much they are (with sensors, so they charge you if anything is moved/touched) but since I travel often I am skeptical of anything in the room and never use it/touch it, etc...

We had dinner at the hotel restaurant once, and it was nothing special, except the price! Our room had a pc, but we didn`t use it. Television was ok, but the remote control didn`t work from the bed, you had to be about 1 m distance. The lobby staff was courteus and helpful.

They gave us room assignment with a sheet of paper. It said that there will be a power outage between midnight and 8AM. I was a little puzzled that a 4 star hotel can have no electricity in the room for an extended period. The desk clerk said, when asked \"Is this real?\", \"Won't you be sleeping?\". Then I read the fine print that indicated it is only for 5 floors or so out of 30 floors they have! Of course I protested (why would I check into Manhattan hotel if I were to sleep all night?) and the clerk without any resistance changed our room to high floor with no electricity interruption without saying anything. She was smiling all through, but in retrospect, they were trying to con me? I had made the reservation through their own website, so it was not like I used priceline. What they attempted was that without warning or anything they just assigned a room which they knew because of the power problem was not going to be sold at a regular price and hoping we will just take it unknowingly or thinking it's just the way it is. Some foreigners might even have language problem and don't understand the situation fully. What they should have done was maybe offer the customer these rooms for half the price with explanation. What they did instead was one of the lowest class act I have ever encountered at a hotel - not to mention 4-start hotel.
