If you are interested in exterior and interior home design and like spending time in an idyllic setting then this is the place for you. For us, staying at La Cazalla added a separate and very satisfying aspect to our visit to Ronda. We are still talking about how special this property was. The house is beautiful both in its design and decor (there are many rock outcroppings incorporated into the house), there's lots of space to relax, and the outdoors are simply beautiful. Yes, there's a dirt road to travel to get to the property, but it's not that bad and adds a bit of adventure to your stay. All in all, the dirt road is a little over 1 km, and it takes less than 10 minutes (about 5 km total) to drive to \"old\" Ronda where many of the sights and restaurants are located. If you like a property which is not only comfortable and gorgeous, but interesting and unique as well, La Cazalla is not to be missed.", "title": "We are still talking about this property!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Coolcoops", "date": "October 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 21334133, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The design", "disliked": "\u2014 The narrow time period to get breakfast"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "As noted in some of the prior reviews, Maria is particular about the property.

Breathtaking scenery, total peace and seclusion, no TV's, no phone signal (!), no passing traffic, and on most occasions - the pool to yourself! This is the perfect place to unwind or grab some peace and quiet and a switch of from the usual day-to-day. The rooms are large and the home very warm and welcoming. Hosts, Maria and Rodriguez are delightful and very helpful and if you like animals, they have a pet dog (and couple of cats) that are always super-pleased to see you! The pool is surrounded by gorgeous smelling wild lavender and mint and the sunbathing areas discretely designed so that you are seated in two's with privacy and shade. The property has some lovely tracks to explore from which I understand there are some scenic walks/hikes. There is a 3km bumpy track/road (un-tarmaced) to the property, taking you down to the floor of the valley, but this was in no way a hinderance and actually added to the charm and authenticity of the property. Once at the top of the track, you are on the fringes of Rhonda, which is 10 minutes (max) from the house. I would definately return and would consider this one of the most private, delightful, beautiful and peaceful treasures that I have ever stayed in. Take a good book (or two).", "title": "Constrained Atmosphere", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "TheTapas2", "date": "February 24, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 13802670, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The walk in shower", "disliked": "\u2014 the atmosphere, route to get there, the inflexibility, small toilet with sink rather than bathroom"}}], "location": {"country": "Spain", "region": "Andalucia", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 1, "very good": 4, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 49}, "aka": "La Cazalla Ronda", "slim_ranking": 0.25, "description": "In our bedrooms you will find king sized beds, small fridges where you can keep your own snacks,water kettles and cups and also free tea and coffee envelopes for you to serve yourself at your convenience.
