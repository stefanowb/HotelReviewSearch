I'm still not. However after my wife cajoled and harassed me enough I finally made a reservation at a Best Western Premier last summer, and we were hooked. I made another reservation Feb 23rd at the Best Western Premier in Denton. The good thing is all the Premier rooms are basically the same. And that quality has sold me on Best Western Premier. Ethernet internet I like for info protection--its there. A sofabed with a chaise lounger at one end--there, too. A bed that rivals our Tempur-pedic at home?--Amazingly its there, as well. Stack that with HD TV with 4 HBO and 4ESPN and both the wife and I have something to argue about (usually we don't have enough amenities to argue about at all!!). Now for my favorite part; breakfast. Buffet with a real yogurt section and a variety of fruit to add, scrambled eggs, sausage links, hash browns o'brian, and a made to order omelet that is stuffed, and I mean \"stuffed\", with almost anything you would want in an omelet. The only downside is there aren't many of these Premiers across the country. But you can believe if this is the standard with which all are run I will be planning trips in the future by the where the Best Western Premiers are at.", "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 25, 2013", "id": 153131985}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room was large, comfortable, nicely decorated, clean--in other words, all you could ask", "title": "By far the best hotel we stayed in.", "user": "Louiselallier", "date": "February 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152714259}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "for.
