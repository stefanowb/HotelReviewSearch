The grounds are extraordinary, the main hall is amazing and the staff really made it even better. Not only did they anticipate our every need---but they went above and beyond in every aspect.

In one sense i want to tell everyone so they can share in the experience, but in another slightly selfish way, I dont want too many people to go so as to ruin it!! The hotel is situated in a fabulous location so that all the bedrooms (11 in main building) get excellent views. Upon arrival we were greeted by the GM with a glass of champagne and a friendly tour of the property. We were then shown to our very beautiful room, The Maharani Suite. It is very lavish with lots of interesting pieces of furniture and art and an amazing bed in the middle with views over the beautiful vineyard and over the lake. The bathroom was huge and beautifully done too. I have to say, all the suites are amazing, but the superior suites are bigger and ours had one of the best views!! There is almost nothing they wont do for you here, they even came to unpack our cases ( i unpacked my own, but when doing my husbands, they ever RE FOLDED my garments which were already in the wardrobe!!) In the room is a decanter of brandy for you to indulge in, and there was champagne on ice for our arrival. On top of this, there was a snack cupboard with all complimentary treats, jelly beans , crisps, chocolate etc and in the mini bar soft drinks and miniature spirits all comp ! We have stayed at other lovely hotels ( mainly The Four Seasons level of hotel) and have never had anything thrown in! Also, by the pool, all soft drinks are free and they will also do your laundry complimentary. All of these little touches are very much appreciated as was the complimentary car service into the village of Franshoek. The food is amazing and if there is something that you fancy other than what is on the lunch menu, they are happy to oblige. And it is served up so prettily with lavender decoration, fresh from the herb garden. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and nothing is too much. The GM , Edward, is a very hands on kind of guy, very friendly and is always around for a little chat.

Therefore, I will spare you all the details regarding room cleanliness, value for money, etc and rather see how many superlatives I can cram into this review. La Residence is positioned in one of the most idyllic places on earth with uninterrupted views of the mountains and winelands. Smells of lavender and flowers surround the premises. The interior decorating is beyond imagination with every detail meticulously crafted to the point that you could spend days just admiring the variety of decor and artwork at this \u201chotel\u201d. However, the crowning achievement for La Residence is the way you are made to feel during your stay. The personnel were amazing in that they managed to provide the feeling of complete privacy whilst still attending to our every whim before the thought had even occurred. The only way I can describe this is by likening it to a very warm family event. I really could go on about how amazing La Residence and its staff are but I will try sum up my feelings about this place. This was the destination I decided to propose to my fianc\u00e9 and can say without hesitation or doubt that it was the best experience of my life. The staff of La Residence went above and beyond and made us feel truly special and welcome. Nothing was too big of a request, and everything was handled in the most eloquent of ways. I am truly grateful to La Residence and its staff, and can honestly say that is very difficult to put a value on the experience they are able to create for you.
