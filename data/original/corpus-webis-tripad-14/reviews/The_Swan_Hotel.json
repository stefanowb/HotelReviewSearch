We chose the Swan hotel as it looked lovely and picturesque and the cottages they offered looked spot on for our requirements. We booked to stay 3 nights in the Whooper Cottage and it was perfect in every way. Tucked at the end of a row of cottages owned by the hotel situated at the side of the main building, it was quiet and secluded. Entrance to the cottage is through a gate and a fair sized garden including a covered hot tub which was just brilliant, even on a cold wet March evening, it was lovely to chill out in and drink champagne.", "user": "TheRevster", "date": "March 17, 2010", "id": 58796084}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful birthday break!", "text": "The cottage itself is lovely and much bigger than I expected, it has a large hallway, fair sized living room with sofa, large flat screen TV, DVD player and iPod player and double doors to the patio - which has table chairs and a heat lamp which we unfortunately didn't get to use because of the rain. The stairs wind upwards into a large bedroom with huge comfy bed and another huge TV. The bathroom is also really large with bath, double sinks and seperate toilet (there is a stand alone shower in a small room off the hallway downstairs) Everything was lovingly decorated and clean and there were plenty of towels and robes. There is a lovely added touch of full size Molton Brown products and not the usual travel sizes which you get in a lot of places. We felt that this added to the special feel of the place and it really was lovely and cosy and homely.", "user": "rachie1781103", "date": "February 10, 2010", "id": 55621993}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "OUTSTANDING", "text": "The hotel itself is also very nice. We ate in the restaurant on the first night. The staff were very attentive and whilst the meal wasn't cheap, it's what you would expect to pay in a decent hotel and the restaurant had a lovely atmosphere and the food was very nice. Similarly we also ate in the bar the last night and again food and service were great. As we were in the cottage we got our breakfast delivered to our room every morning which was a nice touch and meant we could lounge around a bit more. There is a really homely and cosy feel to the whole place and I would definitely recommend the Swan Hotel.", "user": "sugarpuff4178", "date": "February 9, 2010", "id": 55591575}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "The perfect festive break", "text": "As for Bibury itself, it is lovey and picturesque but there really isn't much around (especially if it's raining and you don't want to walk far) so you are restricted to the hotel for food etc really if you don't want to drive anywhere.

We paid extra for a superior room which was spacious and decorated nicely. They provide tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits plus real milk if you ring down to reception delivered to your room which makes a real difference to the usual UHT milk. The bathroom was really spacious and the hotel provide Molton Brown toiletries. We ate in the restaurant on the first night which was pretty good, not worth paying \u00a332 for though but it was part of our package. On the second night we ate in the bar and we actually thought the food was better here.

The nozzles were grubby. There were 2 huge cobwebs laden in dust over the shower cubicle. The water runoff in the shower cubicle door was filthy.
