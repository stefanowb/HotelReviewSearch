This particular suite could easily fit six people. The room had a lovely decor with updated amenities; it was overall clean and comfortable. Additionally, they offered free internet access, free parking and free buffet breakfast and snacks in the afternoon. Plus, it's only a few minutes drive from downtown La Jolla and San Diego - but they also offer complimentary shuttle service on weekdays within a five mile radius to certain locations. We paid about $169 total including taxes. You couldn't ask for more! It's like a home away from home. Some minor shortcomings? Check in was a little slow - and our requests for hygiene items were also not immediately forthcoming. Parking on weekends can be a pain too; it was packed when we arrived there in the late evening.
