The minute the shuttle dropped us off and we saw the surrondings and rooms I was in tears (keep reading..it gets better). It seemed to me that I was visiting a local park and the rooms were kept up as well as a public restroom! Ok..the rooms were huge I will give them that.....but, there was dust 3 inches thick in the walk in closet cubbies where I was suppose to put all of the clothes. The tub had a ring of mold around it and so did the shower curtain. My friend's room next door had the same problem plus her lock didn't work on the door. I didn't come with high expectiations...I long ago gave up thinking \"The Ritz\" I didn't' mind that the decor was outdated and ugly or that the floor was tile but I found it TOTALLY unreasonable that the place wasn't clean. At that minute, If I could have gotten our money back I would have left on the spot! The head manager was \"out of town\" all week and I spend the next day or two speaking with various \"managers of the day\" All foreign, all sweet and all clueless.

We should have set the precendent very early that they had to go for at least a few hours each day. They did LOVE LOVE LOVE the circus area and did the trapeze day after day.

A stroller was provided from the hotel, which was great. What really surprised me and completely disappointed me were the lack of activities provided for children not in the kids' club. The kids' clubs did not work for my children at all, so there was absolutely nothing for my children to do on this vacation. There was not even a wading pool. If you do not pay for your children to use the kids' clubs, then you cannot use any of their services. So without the kids' clubs, it is not a kid-friendly environment. My husband and I have travelled a lot, and this hotel is extremely overrated. The absolute worst part was the man-made \"beach\". It looks nice in pictures, but it is repulsive!! There are 'snake-fish' (I don't remember the name) everywhere, and I've been told they bite! I would never swim in the swamp or dare put my children in it.

I dropped her off for about an hour the second day of our trip just to see how she would do and she didn\u2019t even look back and didn\u2019t want to leave when I picked her up. Lots of toys, always 2 to 3 GO\u2019s to play with and plenty of other kids to play with, they take two walks a day in strollers, one in the am and one in the pm. Every time I would go peak in on her (more of a separation problem for me) a GO was playing with her, hugging her or giving her a kisses. My schedule would be to drop her off at 9:15, so I could eat breakfast in peace and quiet, pick her up at noon so she could nap in our hotel room, I tried having her nap in the Rascal Room once, but she wouldn\u2019t go down with other kids around, so I opted to take her back to the room everyday. After her nap, I would take her swimming in the baby pool behind the Mini Club for an hour or so. The baby pool was great, we were the only ones in the pool, it was fantastic, it\u2019s only one foot deep, so with her water wings, she could walk around and they have plenty of balls, floats, buckets in the pool to play with. If you do choose to use the baby pool, make sure you wear an old swim suit, I ruined the bottoms on two new swimsuits while scooting around chasing my daughter. The bottom of the pool is a textured concrete. I would then bring her back to the Rascal room around 3:30ish and she would stay until about 5:00.

They do not care about you. My family never did get a dysfunctional rear-door lock repaired; they were told to use the chain lock!!! How many places even still HAVE chain locks? The last night they were there the air conditioner malfunctioned, apparently outgassing freon-like vapors, leaving my son, especially, somnulent enough so that there was difficulty shaking him awake. He even turned a strange shade of yellow for a few hours (no, there are no strange substances associated with this). All very strange, but the staff were largely unconcerned, even though we mainly wanted to make sure it didn't happen to anyone else.

But guess what, I was pleasantly surprised. First, lets talk about the rooms. We were in building E, maybe we were lucky ? but the rooms were very clean, extremely large, perfect for a family of four like us, with a very convenient stroller to go around the location. So, really, nothing to complain about. And for the rest, most of the reviews already said that the food was very good, that was true, and the animation, extraordinary, especially the circus shows at night. So, I am back and I am still a Club Med fan. My only disappointment was that, well, I am French-speaking and I choose Club Med partly because of that. Well, this Club Med is very much oriented to an american clientele so the animation was all english. This is too bad because if I want an english-speaking club, I can go to Beaches, Superclub and all the others. So my kids did not participate very much to the activities but nonethless, they had a fantastic time watching the shows and they had access to all the same facilities as the mini-clubs kids, so they did not miss much.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "andy1anna", "date": "April 1, 2007", "id": 7266437}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We just returned from a week vacation from July 22nd to July 29th so this review is hot off the press!!
