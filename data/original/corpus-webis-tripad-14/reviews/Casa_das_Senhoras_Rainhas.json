It was absolutely, a fantastic hotel. We were so impressed. We travel a lot and this hotel totally iwas just amazing. The staff was so kind and helpful, even letting us stay past checkout because we had a later afternoon bus to catch. And the rooms were just beautiful. We had a balcony overlooking the city walls. Sitting out there, enjoying our free welcome cocktail was just heavenly. The location is perfect - right in the walled city. We dined at the hotel restaurant and found that to be just perfect as well. A very good sophisticated meal in a beautful dining room. And the breakfast was great as well. This was a truly perfect stay.
