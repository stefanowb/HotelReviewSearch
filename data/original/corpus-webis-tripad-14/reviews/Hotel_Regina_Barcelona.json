Staff is attentive without being at all intrusive. The bar/lounge area is the perfect spot for reading/checking e-mail while enjoying a glass of wine or cool drink after a long day of sightseeing. Yesterday I had to file a story on a tight deadline and I couldn't have asked for a more perfect environment. The family room is spacious and well-appointed. What I love most about Hotel Regina is that it retains a funky charm--nothing sterile or homogenized. Of course, the real draw is the perfect location--we can walk down La Rambla to the port, through the Gothic Quarter and back, take the Hop-on, Hop-off bus (stops virtually in front of the hotel) or catch the Metro within a one-minute walk.

We took a long time to select our hotel via the internet and eventually plumped for this hotel because of the location. It was at the higher end of our price range but we were very pleased with the location and the service we recieved. We stayed for three nights at the beginning of May. On our arrival the gentleman at the reception desk gave us a friendly welcome and recommended some attractions and restaurants at our request. Our rooms were spacious and clean with balconies to the front of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the room was extremely dark at night with only a small hum of the metro beneath so we had no problem with sleep. I actually had to leave the bathroom light on because I'm not used to pitch black at home. The location of the hotel is directly off the main square Placa de Catalunya where you can easily get a taxi back to the airport and jump on the Bus turistic tour. The bus tour can be booked through the hotel for a discount price. You pay 4 euros each at reception and then get 6 euros off the price in the kiosk in the square. So a you get a saving of 2 euros each over the two days. We didn't use the hotel breakfast facillities as we initially thought the price was high, but after venturing out into the town we would probably use the hotel if we went to Barcelona again. The food was very expensive. Although in the end we did enjoy a breakfast at the Happy grill near the hotel that was a reasonable price. Overall we would definately recommend the hotel to others and would stay here again if we went back to Barcelona.

The hotel is located 2 minutes from Plaza Catalunya and could not be in a better location to get around the city. We got the airport bus in which leaves you off outside the Corte Ingles right opposite the street the hotel is on. When we arrived, check in was quick and the staff could not be more helpful. They gave us a family room for 4, a triple room for 3 and a superior double which also had an extra partition with a bed in it. The rooms all had bottles of champagne, large bathrooms with 2 sinks and lots of toiletries. The beds were huge and very comfortable and each room had a 32 inch plasma screen. We asked for rooms on the first floor and they were all located together so it was like having your own little section of the hotel. I contacted the manager who is also manager of the award winning Hotel Pultzier which is next door and we were also able to use their amenities too. The manager arranged for us to have rooms plus breakfast, which turned out to be the best choice and well worth the extra money. It was a buffet breakfast with a variety of breads/ croissants/ cakes/ cheeses/juices/ cereals/ tortillas/ fresh fruit and salads and more.. The staff were extremely helpful, in particular Lucila who heled us get concert tickets. The food in the hotel is really good and reasonably priced and the bar staff make sure everything is perfect for you. For some of the group, it was our 2nd time in Barcelona and it was even better this time around. before we stayed in Barceloneta beside the beach which is a bit of a trek into the city centre. Everything is within walking distance of Hotel Regina and it really helps when you have somewhere luxurious to come back to when you have had a long day playing the tourist.
