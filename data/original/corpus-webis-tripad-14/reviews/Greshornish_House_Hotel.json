The approach to the Greshornish was amazing - long dirt road full of sheep and beauty. Both innkeepers (husband and wife) were terrific. Be prepared for a typical small inn type of room (although told would have tv, the cable seemd to be out for some time, so no tv). The lack of tv was actually a bonus as it gave my husband and I time to relax. You will certainly feel at home and the dinner was fantastic. After a week of terrble food in Scotland (as one might suspect), we were happy to have a truly delicous dinner. I cannot say enough about our charming hosts.

I guess this is understandable, given the difficulty of running a B&B, but a real pro should never let it show.

Perhaps I was just fortunate to have had such great weather but my five-day stay at the hotel was simply incredible. Despite arriving late on the first night, Rosie and Neil (the hosts) were extremely welcoming and I was soon enjoying a game of snooker against Neil having enjoyed an absolutely fantastic dinner (the quality of which did not dip once during my stay). The atmosphere of the hotel is such that you can easily strike up friendships with fellow guests over a coffee by the fire in the gracious sitting room. As such, I soon found myself a tennis playing partner for the rest of my stay. Besides my tennis exploits, I found the hotel to be the perfect launch-off point for a number of expeditions, including a visit to Skye's two great castle's - Dunvegan and Armadale. Indeed, perhaps what I enjoyed most were the walks direct from the hotel itself. As they say, when the sun shines in Scotland there is simply nowhere more beautiful on this planet.
