We booked this hotel in error as we booked through a third party so we were a bit apprehensive about where we were going to end up. Fortunately on arrival we were pleasantly surprised. Although the hotel looks a bit dated from the front the reception was clean and welcoming. The room was very spacious and there was plenty of room for my family of five. the furniture is dated but that was no big deal. The gardens were lovely and there was a pool but unfortunately that is most of the positives. We went to the pool on the first night. Its one pool and ranges from 1m to 1.7m deep so unless your children are confident in water the pool is a big no no. There is no real shallow end and there is no childrens pool. The toilets are not in the changing rooms which is really annoying when you have to drag a 2 and 3 year old out into the entrance hall to use the bathroom. There is a steam room which smells of really stinky feet and a sauna.", "title": "alright but not great", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "maisy m", "date": "July 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 167254390}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Breakfast in the morning is ok.

Dinner in the bar is pretty expensive and again short staffed and takes really long to get served. The poor fellas were sweating trying to attend everyone. It was 8 euros for a basic kids meal and up to 14 if they wanted a starter and dessert. Adult meals were lovely but had no choice of side order for a 14 euro meal. We were lucky we had really good weather and were able to sit outside in the garden and play with the kids. If there was bad weather we would have been lost.

It is located on Dublin Bay about a 10 miles from the city center. It has a wonderful view of the Dublin Bay and the Hill Of Howth. Our room was a family room although it was a bit on the small side compared to other family rooms I have stayed at. The bathroom was also small but very clean as was the bedroom. We had a lovely view over the gardens at the back of the hotel. It also has a really nice swimming pool onsite. Each day there is a carvery lunch served in the bar which we went to on several occasions and each time enjoyed a very good meal with a great selection of roasted joints, salmon, vegetables etc. Most of the people there appeared to be locals and not residents of the hotel. The bar/lounge at the back of the hotel is very bright and spacious but the chairs and upholstery are very worn and stained, way past their sell by date. It really takes from the room itself when you are taken aback by the appearance of the chair you are about to sit in. I would hope this is something they are looking into upgrading soon as it is definitely something that needs to be done. For the most part, the staff were friendly and helpful except when we tried to extend our stay. I checked first that the room was available for one more night and was told by the person on duty it was but she could not give me the rate I already had as it was a Friday and on weekends you can only book a room if you include breakfast, there are no room only options. I found this strange and as there were 4 of us the cost of the room for one more night with breakfast would have been almost double the rate we already had. I have on many occasions stayed an extra night or two at a hotel and always got it for the same rate I already had. When we got the chance later to check online, I discovered that I could book \u201croom only\u201d on that Friday so we were kind of annoyed that there was no effort made on behalf of this staff member to accommodate us for another night. Usually you will get a \u201clet me see what I can do\u201d but not in this case.

We had breakfast early on all three days and again found no complaint, good cold buffet selection and hot cooked breakfast to order. The hotel is in a very good location, close to the Dart, local shops and the lovely Howth harbour and town where there a number of bars, shops and restuarants.

The room itself was decent enough. The bed was comfy. It had tea/coffee facilities, ironing board, telly was old but adequate. The views over Dublin Bay were breathtaking. On arrival the room was stiflingly warm. The heat was on in the room. However, not really their fault. The weather has been freakishly warm for late September this year ! Didn't take long to cool down the room, by opening the windows to let in some fresh sea air ! The receptionist on arrival and departure was very polite. The bar in the hotel is nice. The bar food is delicious. Very very nice. I had BLT and chips and it was exceptional. Highly recommended. The only minuses to the place were that there was a musty smell in the corridors to the bedrooms. I think the smell was coming from the carpets. Another thing I find amazing is that the carpetted floor to the bar/lounge area is always filthy. I can't understand this. This is always the same, crumbs and papers everywhere. It really lets the place down. Someone should be hoovering up after meal finish at 9.30pm. The staff seem to work very hard, and are pleasant. One of them needs to use a hoover though ! The breakfast was very nice. Overall great value for the price that we paid.
