The location at Chibuya puts one within a short walk of an endless number of restaurants and all kinds of shopping. If one wants the high end stores then there were several department stores with all the high end possible.(Worth a visit just to see the quality of merchandise with men's shirts starting at $165 and ties at $100..and one of these great department stores even had a real theatre pipe organ where a young lady was giving a mid-morning performance). My son found a store (Ulo I think) nearby where he could not believe the deals and ended up buying so much I had to carry home a pile of t-shirts (at $19 each) and a linen sports jacket at $49. To visit Chibuya Square at 10pm and see literally hundreds lined up obediently waiting for the light to cross and then they come like a tidal wave of humanity...sit upstairs at Starbucks and marvel at the Times Square of Tokyo).

First the staff are so courteous and helpful..the concierge insisted in wallking me outside to show me the 711 which is in the hotel where there is an ATM and the chamber maid refused any tip..what a change from almost anywhere! As many other reviews point out the room is quite spacious, well and tastefully furnished, the internet at $10 a day worked perfectly on my laptop, but the bathroom is to write about...we loved the walk-in marble shower with glass separation so the bathroom does not get steamed up. Beds are very comfortable with European duvets and three types of pillows so I had my favourite down-filled. The fridge has room to add a few things of your own...(I was surprised that they did not provide an ice bucket or wine glasses, only regular drink glasses). The breakfast is excellent and well presented but like any top hotel at $30 for the buffet a little pricy especially when outside nearby the Starbucks or a myriad of other little coffee shops offer sufficient for less than $10...even $5. The hotel gave me a room facing away from the Square on the 27th floor but at my request moved me when my son arrived to a room on the 37th overlooking what I call Tokyo's Central Park with all the skyscrapers like the Hyatt in the distance..incredible view night or day and on top Mount Fuji as well became visible one weekend of my 2 week stay. The beauty of this hotel is that although next a major cross-city 6 lane roadway because the rooms are all on 20 or above floors with excellent sound-proofing there is absolutely no outside sound except an occasional helicopter. And finally it was well worth the price to have dinner in the bar on the 42nd floor..incredible view..(the French restaurant is one star Michelin but expect $100 a person minimum)...the only complaint about the bar is that the non-smoking is in a small area so we preferred to be in the smoking area with the incredible view and the ventilation system was so good despite the two men smoking cigars nearby we could not smell the cigars. With pre-dinner drinks, wine, a full three course meal for 4 persons and after dinner brandy plus the cover charge of $8 each the meal came to just under $300. On top of everything, I can only praise the excellent and very courteous helpful service at all times..wonderful.", "title": "Best hotel we ever stayed at!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "violet37", "date": "April 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14803696, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness, comfort, feeling of luxury, food, views, location... you name it!", "disliked": "\u2014 If it was one block to the other side of Shibuya station it would be perfect!"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled on business", "text": "Tokyo, Japan was the first of several stops on a 10-day Japan roller-coaster style vacation.
