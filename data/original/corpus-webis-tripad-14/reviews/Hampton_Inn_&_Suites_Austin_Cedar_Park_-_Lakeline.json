Very clean, quiet, and super friendly staff. We have stayed at alot of Hampton Inns over the years, and this one had everything we love about Hampton except for a microwave and fridge in our room. Those amenities are part of the reason we choose Hampton Inns, and we have come to expect it - especially at a newer property. This property only offers it in their suites (which aren't available at my per diem rate). Since we were staying for 2 weeks, we asked for one to be put in our room, but was told that it was not possible. What a shame, because if they would have only been willing to do it, this would be my choice for all future stays. Instead, I will have to look elsewhere next time. I stay weeks at a time, and a fridge/microwave is needed. Also, very finicky A/C unit - either too cold or up one degree and the heater kicks on. Very noisy with it kicking on/off constantly.", "title": "Very good, but missing a few things I expect from Hampton", "user": "Tessa C", "date": "August 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173399385}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed here last weekend for a family wedding, and it was a very convenient location to highways and restaurants.
