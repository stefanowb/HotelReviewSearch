We checked in pretty late and the office was very helpful in making sure we got our keys to check into our unit. Our until had three bedrooms and the kitchen facilities were excellent. You just don't know sometimes esp. when you trade a unit and it lists all these amenities but when when you show up it's not as it says. The unit was beautiful and the airconditioning and fans worked. We visited the Great Barrier Reef (the front desk book the tour for us), the Kuranda Gardens (held a koala) and drove to the beach (which we definitely recommend Palm Cove beach). We definitely recommend Palm Cove area. It's got some beautiful hotels that we wished someone would have told us about that is not far from Cairns. The beaches in Cairns aren't really swimming beaches but Palm Cove is. It's a very pretty town. We drove down to Mission Beach which was hit by a hurricane before we went so the beaches and trees were damaged unfortunately. There are computers that you can pay per use in the reception area and a ton of brochures on activities you can review before booking.", "title": "Great place to stay & base for daily excursions", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "wlslb", "date": "June 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 114841093}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled with family", "text": "We recently stayed at Trinity Links Resort (Sept 2010) and were very happy with the resort.

You really need a car to get into Cairns as it is way to far to walk, not sure how regular the public transport is, but it is a good 5 min or so drive into the main part of Cairns.
