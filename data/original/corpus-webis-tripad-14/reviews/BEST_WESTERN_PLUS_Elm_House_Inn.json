They have really put their heart and soul into it. You even get robes (which you don't in the five star Bellagio in Vegas!). It has free parking outside, very handy. Big room. It's very handy for the wineries, it's pretty much a straight run. It's probably a mile from town so not as convenient as I thought (problem if you both want to drink as you'll have to walk). The road down to the side of the motel is just too pretty for words, it's like a chocolate box scene. It's real 'white picket fence' country, just charming and quaint and gorgeous. I wanted to live in Napa after walking down that road! The staff are very friendly. The owner makes chocolate chip cookies every afternoon, they are the BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER EATEN. EVER!! They are served with pear cider (warm), it's just delicious and welcoming and sweet. Had waffles for brekkie next day, very nice. There are lots of places in town to get brekkie though and I do love a big American breakfast so I'd recommend going out for breakfast. The vineyards themselves are divine. Go to the visitor centre in Napa town centre, they very kindly give you a list of things you might enjoy, you tick the ones you like, then they tell you which wineries are the best ones to suit your tastes! It's brilliant. We went to Beringer and Silverado, really beautiful. Beringer is old and full of tradition. Silverado looks very contemporary and has a cable car ride up to it. You get divine views over Napa. The tours are fantastic, well thought out, great value for money, fab friendly staff. I want to go back and see lots more. Oh, stay away from the fake castle winery, we drove in and drove straight back out - it looks like cheap tack.
