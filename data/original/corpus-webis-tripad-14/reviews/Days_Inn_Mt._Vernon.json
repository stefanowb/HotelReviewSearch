Also there is a chair and ottoman that blocks the flow of the air conditioner, so you need to move it to really feel the coolness of it which is kind of a pain in the rear. Even though the shower pressure is good the hot water was not great at all both days. It would be turned up as hot as it can go, and it eventually got cold after like 3 minutes.

Bathroom updated nicely, but so tiny, hardly room to close the door. Had 2 beds, but one was SO lumpy and you could spring up and down as you sat on it.
