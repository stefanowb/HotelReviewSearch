What makes this place truely special though is the owner, Faruk, who is the most hospitable host I have ever come across. Faruk spent much of his time with us, taking us on walks and driving us to places of interest, and it was this that made our time in Cappadocia so memorable.

The rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished in traditional style (I had the Tulip Room upstairs). They are comfortable and clean - the most comfortable bed I had in Turkey!

But the bonus of Kismet Cave House is the owner, Faruk, who served me very good breakfasts and went out of his way to make sure that I enjoyed my stay in Cappadocia and saw everything of interest in the region. On the second day the private driver/guide was ill, so Faruk gave up his day to be my personal driver/guide/lunch host. He gave me an interesting day of varied experiences and from his conversation I certainly learned more about Turkey than I could from the guide book.

This was our first trip to Turkey and the Cappadocia region (mid December 2012). When we first arrived (mom, dad and our two daughters who are 23 and 21), the entrance and room did not quite look like the web site and we were a little concerned. All that faded away as we were warmly greeted by the Kismet Cave House owner, Faruk Keles, who brought us into his cozy office to have Chai, Apple Tea and Turkish Delights. Faruk is a wonderful host whose main interest is to make you feel welcome to his Cave House. He grew up in Gerome so he knows everybody as well as the area around Cappadocia. He arranged for local tours and a Turkish bath for our family. The Cappadocia region has some very wonderful and unique scenery and great hiking, some of which is in walking distance from his cave house. One night he recommended a local restaurant run by a local family. Wow, what a treat! The mother cooks dinner on a wood oven and the bread is out of this world. Faruk joined us for dinner as did the mother and son who own the restaurant. Faruk was our interpreter and it was a magical evening. Breakfast was included and was simple but delicious. Faruk prepared a delicious breakfast of fruits, breads, cheeses, spreads, yogurt and eggs to order every morning, served in the basement of the cave house. The hotel bedrooms are clean and comfortable, but not elegant. If you are looking for a modern elegant establishment, this is not the place.
