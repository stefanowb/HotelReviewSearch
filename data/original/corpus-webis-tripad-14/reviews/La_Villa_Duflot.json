Judging from the reviews here and also the price we expected it to be above average. Unfortunately it wasn\u00b4t.

The reception and also the service of the staff in the restaurant where we went for dinner was rather cool and impersonal. We felt as if they didn\u00b4t really care whether we there or not. The room was ok but not more than that. Furniture seemed a bit outdated, but I do not want to complain about that. If you expect nothing more than a motel to spend the night, it is ok.
