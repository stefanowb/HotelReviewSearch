The rooms were very well proportioned and the African theme continued. The pool was huge, with a slide for younger children, there was ample room around the pool to sunbathe if you wished and there was a jacuzzi also. One of the best things about this hotel was the food. The hotel had three main restaurants. One was quite formal called Jiko (which we didnt eat in), one was very informal The Mara - better if you wanted a quick snack at lunch and the main restuarant called Boma - was a self service restaurant but the choice and quality of the food was excellent. I dont often eat in hotel restaurants and never from a self service restuarant but the food really was that good we ate hereat least 4 nights of our 10 night stay. Breakfast in this restaurant was equally as good. We took advantage of their room service - it has to be said their Chicken Cesar Salad was one of the best ive ever eaten.

The pool area is large, but the water color thru me off a little. I think it is made to look like a river , but I just like the normal bright blue pool color. When I walked to the animal viewing area, I was shocked to see how far the animals were- not too much of an attraction in my view.

We had been warned about the developement but we didn't see or hear any work going on. We were on the Zebra Trail and it was wonderful. The room, with a savannah view, was perfect - not small at all - the service was effecient, friendly and understated. The breakfast selection at the Boma restaurant was plentiful and fresh and the wait for a table was very short. The swimming pool with 3 lifeguards during the day was warm and inviting and a moonlight swim at 10pm one evening was a delight. For me the hi-lite of our stay was watching giraffe from our balcony. There were several animal watching areas with knowledgeable rangers happy to answer questions about the animals. The transportation was brilliant and we never waited for more than 15-20 minutes for a coach from any of the parks or the hotel. We had looked forward to our trip for two years and our expectations were high and we all agreed that it was even better than we had hoped. We would recommend this hotel for anyone as there was plenty of entertainment for children of all ages or time and space just to sit and watch the animals.", "title": "A Dream Come True", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "DeniseBournemouth_UK", "date": "May 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 15767871, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 being able to see savannah animals"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I was soo looking forward to staying here but quite frankly it just does not live up to the hype.

In addition we mainly looked over the public viewing area which was ugly to look at and due to the lack of animals resulted in more people staring at me than the savannah! There is another savannah at the back of the hotel which you can also view form the pool area which has more interesting animals and baby giraffes so if you pay all those extra dollars for a savannah view like I did make sure you ask to be on that side as I can\u2019t recommend where we were !", "title": "Over priced not many animals and dark rooms", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "trapar", "date": "May 5, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 15676891, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The animals when they turned up", "disliked": "\u2014 Location (too far from other Dinsey parks)"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room was very small and very dark .
