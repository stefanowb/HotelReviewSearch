The location is very nice just in front Gare Montparnasse (railway station) with access to everywhere by public transportation. Nearby Quartier Latin wich is lovely to go out at night and have a drink. Around the corner is also Tour Montparnasse with scenic views to the city (try not to miss Restaurant Ciel de Paris). The hotel itself is high quality, modern and recently renewed. Helpful frontdesk staff and lovely commercial team. The room is well decorated and have all the ameties expected for an hotel this level. A nice expercience during the weekend even though didn\u00b4t spent much time at the hotel.

The room was very clean, had a good view (10th floor), and the bed was exceedingly comfortable. Mini-bar was unsurprisingly over-priced however there is a small supermarket just next door - we also chose to forgo the hotel breakfast/dinner as there are many local restaurants. The room did have some useful amenities such as British and USB plug sockets. The hotel is just across from the Montparnasse station which has excellent metro links to all of Paris, and for those flying into CDG there is a AirFrance bus that you can catch from the airport to a bus stop just across the road from the hotel.

Recommend using the 13 line around the corner, especially for returning to the hotel, since the metro return in gare montparnasse, altho across the street, would often require a long walk thru the underground tunnels or on the street if you exit the huge train station on the other side. If you like to walk instead of metro, there are some sites within walking distance.
