My overall experience of the hotel was wonderful. We arrived at the hotel at 9am and was hoping I could leave our bags into storage until we could check in. The receptionist found a room for me straight away however and we were able to check in early. We were also offered the complimentary continental breakfast that morning. A member of staff came to turn down the bed in the evening and left slippers and a chocolate. We ate in the Bistro restaurant that evening and it was very nice. There was a pianist in the lobby bar after dinner so we stayed there for a few drinks. The following morning we had the complimentary continental breakfast again and we didn't have to check out until 12 o clock. The concierge stored our luggage for us for a few hours until we were leaving Dublin. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.
