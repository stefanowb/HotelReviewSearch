I chose the hotel because I had lived in Amsterdam for ten years and had always wanted to stay there based on its reputation for being one of the best--NOT SO! I think it is time the hotel had its star status reviewed and at least one star revoked. From the moment we arrived at the hotel to check in we were treated coldly by reception. The rooms were by no means up to any four star standard I have ever experienced (our friends' bedding was stained). The rooms we were assigned were unappealingly decorated. All in all the staff was unhelpful and aloof. The only good thing about the hotel is its location and the breakfast was satisfactory.

This was our second stay at the hotel. The location is great \u2013 Amsterdam is a small town, and the hotel is located a quick walk or tram to all venues. We requested a high floor because the area is so touristy and the crowds linger long into the evening. We heard no street noise. The bed was very nice. The bathroom has no shade/curtain/privacy \u2013 so you\u2019ll be a bit exhibitionist while you suds up \u2013 but the fifth floor is higher than most other buildings around, so not a huge deal. There\u2019s a small, shabby balcony with two chairs. The balcony could really use a makeover and would be a great selling point. Right now it\u2019s an ugly afterthought with poor, uneven and wet flooring and no charm. The room is large, feels a bit worn down. There\u2019s duct tape on the A/C unit, the first thing I noted. Because this hotel is not cheap \u2013 and we had a good experience here three years ago \u2013 I was disappointed with the room quality. There\u2019s nothing in the way of amenities \u2013 no robes, slippers or good bath products. You can get room service but it\u2019ll cost you 10 euros. Wifi is extra. The front desk was efficient. So \u2013 the hotel is in a good location and the room experience was OK. Not great, not horrible, just fine.
