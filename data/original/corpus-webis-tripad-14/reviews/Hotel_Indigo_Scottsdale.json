The service at this hotel inspired us to finally sign up with TA and share our wonderful experience. That\u2019s how great it was! This hotel is truly a hidden gem. Having been to Scottsdale several times in the recent past, I was surprised to not have heard of the Indigo sooner. Usually we stay at the Firesky or Hotel Valley Ho. Recently we even paid the heavy price to try out the new W, which wasn't really worth it. That review to follow soon. We are very fond of the other resorts and have always had pleasant experiences. However, they simply cannot compete with the value and personality of the Indigo. The location is impossible to beat. You are surrounded by numerous restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, all within walking distance. Being so close to Scottsdale Fashion Mall is a huge plus too; for the wife anyway. We did find that the area was buzzing during the weekend in the immediate area and can understand how this activity could be a distraction for some guests. We read some other reviews citing the neighborhood noise, and are glad to have tried it out anyway. The entrance is quirky and doesn't do the rest of the hotel justice. Beyond that, the place is gorgeous! I think this hotel is about being in the middle of the action while still being able to provide a relaxing and charming experience. New gym, fantastic patio/bar area and phenomenal service. There front line staff and especially bartenders are some of the best we have ever experienced in all of our travels.

So we opted for the Hotel Indigo Scottsdale as the hotel's website made the place seem boutique and cute. (I have a pet peeve for ugly hotel rooms). When we arrived around 7pm that evening I was informed by the guy working the front desk that my card was 'declined because I had to have $200.00 deposit on my card' although I had enough on there to cover the initial room's expense ($130.00) and 4x that amount in cash that I was intending to pay with anyway. He had a 'tuff luck' and antipathetic attitude as he sent us away to the nearest bank to add funds to cover the $200.00 deposit, \"and if you don't soon we'll have to charge the account anyway because we have a 24 hour cancellation policy\"...uhmm..yeah..I'm not trying to cancel..", "title": "Average Hotel, You get what you pay for.

What a mistake. The reviews seemed mixed (although I should have sorted them by worst first) so I thought we would give it a try. First the room decor is stark and mismatched. It is supposed to be modern but it is creepy and dorm- like. There are few lights in the room and the ones that are there shed a creepy light, almost a black light look to them. The shower stall is gross and the tiles didn't look very clean, we actually went out an bought our own cleaning product to spray on the tile because we were freaked out . Our first night music started from the pool outside and lasted until at least 1 or 2 am. We were unable to go back to sleep that night, so the next morning we called and moved rooms. This was a mistake because at around 2 am we were once again awakened by this loud booming bass coming from one of the many clubs in the area. I finally decided to just get up and go work out in their 24 hour gym at 3 in the morning, when I left my room there were drunk people in the hall making me feel very unsafe. The third night we were totally sleep deprived by this point we were again awake at 2 am by the loud bass plus roaming people in the hall laughing and carrying on. We finally just checked out very early that morning. We had called Travelocity to try to switch hotels but because it was part of a package we were unable to. We got home so tired and sick from lack of sleep it had to be one of the worst trips ever.

Its the old story...you get what you pay for. A number of people have commented on the location of the hotel and that is probably its greatest asset and greatest flaw all at the same time. It is tucked away on a side street off the main drag of Scottsdale Rd so it was a bit hard to find. But the real kicker is that it is in the heart of the clubbing district of downtown Scottsdale. So very centrally located to restaurants, shopping and clubs but NOISY. The NOISE is a threefold problem which is only amplified by non soundproofed windows. Firs there is the street noise from the clubs, second there is the hotels own soundtrack BLASTING all day and night and third is the paper thin walls between hotel rooms. I also agree with several comments regarding room design and layout. Its IKEA on crack. A very uncomfortable bed, a glass shower stall partition with a big circular hole in it for the water to leak out of, draws that are not deep enough to hold much of anything, poor lighting, windows that dont open to allow fresh air in, no carpeting. Parking that competes with all the nightly visitors to Scottsdale clubland. This was by far one of the most unrestful hotels stays I have had in a long time. Oh yeah and the food..well...glad I didnt pay for it either. If you want a central Scottsdale location at a cheap price, this hotel cant be beat.
