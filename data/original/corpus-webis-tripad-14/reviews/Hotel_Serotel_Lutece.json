As others have noted, the rooms are small by US standards - we had a double - just enough room for a suitcase or two (don't take overly large suitcases). The bathroom is reasonably sized by comparison, but the shower stall is compact (plenty of hot water though). The rooms and hotel are clean - they were remodeling the bar/lounge while we were there - and the breakfast area in the cellar is quaint. The staff is excellent and provide great guidance and directions (train, metro, bus) - notably, Michel was very personable and friendly. It's in a very quiet area of the Latin Quarter, a short walk to the Censier-Daubenton metro stop, with a nice bakery next door (got to love the croissants).

My wife and I and our three children stayed here for two nights close to New Year's. This was our third trip to Paris so I looked for somewhere different to stay this time. I had booked it over the internet. The hotel is about a block and a half away from a metro stop, and the location is safe and is lively during the day with a daily street market nearby. Parking (in a garage) was available by the metro stop and was about 17 Euros a day. Our rate came with the breakfast which was more than adequate and included cereal, croissants, fruit, meat and juice. The hotel staff were very friendly and helped us out with general directions. The hotel has a bar in the lobby also. We got two rooms and both rooms were spacious enough (this is Paris!) and had a shower and tub. The rooms were quiet at night and our overall impression was very good. Don't hesitate to look up the hotel website and email with questions about the various rates and specials. I got responses back right away. Internet access is also available in the lobby and runs about 4 Euro for 15 mintues.
