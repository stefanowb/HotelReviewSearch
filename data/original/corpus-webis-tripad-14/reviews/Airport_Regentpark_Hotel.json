Amazing 2-floor suite at a very reasonable room rate, wifi & excellent restaurant. The communication was very good & The Regent has the transportation to/from the airport REALY figured out; they were most accomodating. Can't say enough good things about this outstanding hotel & will definately stay on our next trip to Munich. HIGHLY recommend the Hotel Regent!

Great size and comfortable bed. We had an issue come up on our end early in the evening and the staff were so great at helping us out. A big thank you to them.

Ended up being a strange place but kind of cool. Confused as to which building to go to at first. One is the restaurant, one is the office, and down the street are the apartments with the rooms. Actually down and around the corner, we had to take a golf cart. You can walk, not too far. Rooms were great, modern, roomy, residential. Kids were a bit loud at night playing so used earplugs. Room has nice shower and minibar and a kitchen. Dinner was good back in the one house, breakfast was average but okay. Front desk staff nice and helpful. Restaurant staff is average. Shuttle to airport was great. we dropped off rental and came back to hotel so next day we didn't need to worry about the car. If you call the hotel they send the shuttle. We prearranged for the shuttle to airport and picked the time we wanted. Worked well. Really is a cute and unusual place, sort of has a polo theme, owners must have been into that sport.
