The other hotels in Sydney during this time was pretty expensive. We took the train at Kings Cross Station every day to visit the sites in and around Syndey. It's a few blocks but can feel like a trek since you walk around Sydney so much. It's a city that you have to walk around to see the sights. Our room was nice and it was not noisy. The park behind the hotel has a lot of joggers and the area feels pretty safe. It's just the block at King's Cross Station that is a bit seedy (redlight district) but you do not feel endangered in any way as there's always plenty of people b/c of the restaurants in the area. Overall, if you're looking to stay at a place that doesn't cost an arm and a leg and want a nice hotel - i would recommend it. If you're looking for convenience to walk everywhere from here - I'd say look for an area to stay by the harbour.", "title": "Very good hotel but a bit of a trek", "user": "wlslb", "date": "June 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 114840492}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled on business", "text": "This would have to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.

Upon check in we were not offered any help with luggage, prams etc. Try getting 2 small children out of a taxi and thru your stupid doors. It wasnt busy and 3 people were standing behind the counter watching us and chatting to each other and continued to carry on with their conversation making me feel like I was interupting them so much that I heard there conversation about how one of them having their brother come and live with them and dadada....rude and ignorant. We were finally checked what we thought was a junior sweet but was basically 2 rooms with a door in between propped open with chairs. On one occasion I had the adjoining door close on my 2 children under 3 years and had to go to reception and get another key to get them out. We had booked a childrens package.....not what I had expected. Pool was out of service, gym was pathetic.....really. The lift drove me insane....I was their for business and needed to come and go in a hurry....good luck. The driveway was a pain in the butt. Couldnt hear anything that the receptionist were saying due to the traffic noise.....Not clear as to which button to push to gain entry or exit. (make a sign its not hard) Everything was too difficult for staff members and I didnt meet one that actually tried to engage to help. 1 morning out of the 14 we stayed the children were offered a high chair.....I think you need to seriously review your staff. If they dont care then they shouldnt be employed. Your main problem is inconsistency. Oh also when you have raving lunatic in the room next door and call reception at 3 am you expect something to be done about it.....well looks like you suffered the results of poor service becuase i noticed youy had the maintanence people in the next morning........

I could have paid more for a suite which I declined) and was pleasantly surprised by being upgraded to a Senior Suite (Room 410). So far so good. The suite was fantastic with a seperate lounge and bathroom and a bedroom with ensuite. The staff at check in had only given me 1 key and as this suite had 2 seperate entrances I needed another key to power up the lights to the bedroom ensuite. Rang down and the key was up in minutes. Very efficient. I ordered room service (pasta with prawns) and was at my door witihin about 15 mins and hot. It was delicious. The menu is a little limited but there is probably sufficient choice if you are starving and don't want to venture out like. The bed was very comfortable and the outlook across the park is beautiful.
