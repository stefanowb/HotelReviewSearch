The resort is located on the east side of the island meaning it is less populated and busy, and about a kilometer from the Centre Point ferry station. Great for relaxing and unwinding which is exactly what we wanted. The owners Julian and Cheryl will help sign you up for any kind of tour you would like. We rented a scooter for a day and drove around looking at things on our own pace. The private cabana was wonderful as well. If we ever make it back to Ko Change we will stay at Amber Sands. The restaurant there is pretty tasty as well serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I would have like a little seafood on the menu, but that is the only negative (and a small one at that) I can think of.", "user": "Sn0wSkier", "date": "January 8, 2010", "id": 52981745}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at Amber Sands for a few nights in November 2009 on the back of the reviews written on trip advisor.

The resort's beach is narrow and has orange 'amber' sand rather than the white sand of the west coast. The sea is not as clear and the sea bed a bit rocky but very swimmable. The hotel is right on the beach with individual villas and an average sized swimming pool. There is a hotel kayak to borrow when you feel like it at no cost. The grounds are very well kept with different plants and flowers. Rooms are quite basic but comfortable and a good size, with quiet a/c and fan. The open air restaurant located right on the beach had a good selection of delicious and reasonable thai and western food. There are no other restaurants/resorts nearby so unless you have transport you have to eat here. We enjoyed all our food very much for 3 days here, and we like good food. Breakfasts could be cooked to order but we had fresh fruit and muesli and yogurt. There was free internet on the PC in the restaurnat area and books and magazines to borrow. Julian and Cheryl Cowburn, the owners, were extremely hospitable, friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a relaxing stay. Even in a small hotel such as this we never felt they were imposing or 'claustrophobic', and we are 2 people that like to keep ourselves to ourselves on holiday. They offered lifts to White Sands beach and then drove us there to get our transfer songtaew to Koh Kood island on our last morning when other hoteliers would have made us get a taxi. We paid \u00a335 a night which we considered to be great value for peak season. The hotel is not super-luxurious but laid back, friendly, well kept and comfortable with really delicious food.", "title": "Perfect place for a quiet, relaxing jumping-off point", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LoveThatBlueSky", "date": "January 19, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 53821665}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009, traveled with friends", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Amber Sands for three nights after many crazy days of travel around Thailand and Cambodia.

We where lucky enough to seen a full moon when the bay lights up and glows like something I never seen before just looked so beautiful. The family is just so lovely and accommodating. Cheryl makes a great Nanny while we ate in the restaurant. Deon can sure make a great cocktail. The menu was good and reasonably priced. So what makes Amber Sands one of the best places I have ever stayed at? Is it the rooms and the attention to detail, Is it the lovely gardens, Is it the amazing flora & fauna, Is it the swimming pool over looking the stunning bay, Is it the great ambience at night with the soft lighting, Or the full moon that makes the bay shine like a diamond, Is it the great family service, Is it the friendly local staff.
