Breakfast choices were just ok. Very close to the lakeshore and Summerfest grounds. Great area for those that like to run or walk. They did not clean some of our rooms (after we told the maid we were leaving in an hour or so and to come back then), so that was a little disappointing, but we didn't complain. Fitness center was ok, but sounded like a couple of the machines didn't work very well. Wireless internet worked fine. Overall good value for the price we got, but a few disappointments.
