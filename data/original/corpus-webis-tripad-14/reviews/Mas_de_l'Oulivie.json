The owner personally directs the landscaping crew, you can tell the owner loves his property. They had gated secure parking for car [probably not needed for crime, just nice]. The pool was large irregular shaped, deep. Not standard small rectangle pool. And much, much lounging area with many chaise lounges and contiguous bar/restaurant. Previous reviews said \"pool was too cold\" but I checked the thermometer in the pool and it was 28 degrees [82 degrees] on July 1st. Just 20 second initial shock jumping in, but was fine, and I hate cold water, but thought it was no problem. Many others were swimming- so pool temp is non issue.", "title": "What's Not To Like?", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "flymeaway2", "date": "March 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7199326, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location, setting, quiet, just about everything!"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "eh", "text": "We did sightseeing in morning and returned around 1:00 pm to relax. We highly recommend this scenario, this was the one hotel so far that we really liked to just sit, enjoy, and relax. We had lunch at Hotel restaurant, and we highly recommend this food over many cafe's at tourist trap areas. The food was unbelievable, we had excellent Provence salads, my wife had steak, potatoe and grilled vegetables that she had been craving for after two weeks of crazy French menus [according to her]. The service for lunch and breakfast, the two men that serve at the restaurant [one seems to be property manager in training] were excellent]. So enjoy relaxing here, drinks by the pool, and consider lunch as option [surprisingly excellent, better than outside cafes].", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "pickytravelerVT", "date": "July 7, 2006", "id": 5435670}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Je l'aime beaucoup", "text": "The rooms [we had two rooms across the hall from each other] were very clean and updated.

The room was spotless and the gardens with lavender predominating were beautiful. The staff were friendly, courteous and (fortunately for us) bi-lingual and nothing was too much trouble. There is no evening restaurant but we were recommended some great eating places with reservations made for us and directions provided. There is an attractive pool - a perfect place to spend a lazy sunny afternoon. The highlights for us were the breakfasts and light lunches on the terrace - fillet steaks to die for!
