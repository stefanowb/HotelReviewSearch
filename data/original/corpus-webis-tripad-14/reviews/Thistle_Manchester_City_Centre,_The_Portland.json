Get a cab if you have cases though - cost you \u00a35 or \u00a36 and better than back strain! The hotel is quite grand and at some point in time quite a bit of money was spent on making it look nice and modern. Things come full circle though and it's time some more money was spent on it to bring it up to date! The hotel is comfortable though the rooms seem on the small side - functional I guess. I was on a business trip so just using the room for sleeping in. The hotel has all the facilities you would expect of an establishment that caters for both the business client and the tourist. Bars, internet access, restaurants, etc etc. Unfortunately one thing that stands out for me though was how ruthless the staff on reception are in terms of making sure you pay for everything you have - immediately! I had a meal in my room that I tried to book to my room. This was declined and I had to go straight down to reception to sort it out and pay. It would appear they like to get the money out of you asap. Apart from this slight down point the hotel is good in most every other way. Good central location for finance and business centres and ideal for shopping. Value for money? Not bad for a city centre hotel. Shop around and see what else you can get? Yes - I would.
