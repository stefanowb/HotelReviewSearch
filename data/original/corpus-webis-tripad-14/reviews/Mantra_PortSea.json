The place was great, it was a short walk (10 minutes) from Port Douglas . The room was nice with a spa tub and a pretty good kitchen, we BBQ'd and cooked for 3 out of our 6 nights and saved a bit of money. The Lagoon style pool was very cool. There was no room service or cleaning up, but we preferred not having anyone in our room.

There were many nice people on staff who were actually glad to help. The breakfasts were very good and there were many selections to choose from. The pool bar left a little to be desired as their prices emptied your pocket with one drink. The rooms were very clean and well kept. The showers were amazing! You'll really love the bathrooms! The work out facility would be my only true complaint. They had around 5 or 6 different machines...one of which was in operation and it wasn't working entirely properly. Once they get some new equipment in there, the PortSea Resort will be a fabulous get-away for anyone!", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 5, 2005", "id": 3164537}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2005", "text": "I don't see how there can be any bad reviews for this resort!

We past a tidy reception area and the room did not reflect this.It was dirty, dusty and smelled of damp and was fusty . Our request to have the room cleaned was followed by a change of room to one that was worse, if anything. The cane furniture was ingrained with dirt and dead bugs were left behind the headboard for three days along with a spoon that fell from behind the headboard. We did not unpack our clothes for the whole stay.The carpets were stained and had not been cleaned once during our stay.Shabby and grubby describes the bedding and fittings.
