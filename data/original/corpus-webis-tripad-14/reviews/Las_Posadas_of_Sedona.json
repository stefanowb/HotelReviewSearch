There are still plenty of places to eat in the area and the surrounding vistas are superb. The office staff were very helpful with recommendations (and with mailing me something I left behind). Our super spacious room was on a lower level near the breakfast area so we did not have much of a view from the room, but we had planned to go elsewhere to see the sunset and sunrise so that did not matter too much to us. We did get an opportunity to use the fireplace in the room as the evening was quite chilly. It was great that the fireplace worked on a timer so we could just fall asleep without having to worry about turning it off. After getting up early to view the sunset we returned to have a delicious fully cooked breakfast!

It consisted of a living room, dining room, den, large bedroom with comfortable bed, large bathroom with double sink, beautiful stone tile throughout. The whole villa was very clean. Nice size kitchen with all new appliances. I began planning this trip months ago with Dory. Working with her was wonderful. She went out of her way to do all she could for us. She even offered to open the kitchen early for us on the days we had to leave for golf prior to the kitchen's regular open time. Instead of putting the staff out of their way, we opted to have the kitchen staff deliver a cooked breakfast burrito, delicious fresh yogurt and great granola. The next day they delivered a great bacon,egg,cheese sandwich along with other stuff. My thanks for that! About a week before our trip, I put in a call to Dory to infirm all our special needs and requirements. Miguel answered the phone and told me Dory no longer works there. I was shocked to hear this and was very worried that all our planning we did with Dory would be lost.
