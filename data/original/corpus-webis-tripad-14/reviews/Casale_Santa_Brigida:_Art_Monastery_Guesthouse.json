The area is very peaceful and relaxing, and since it was very hot that week, the pool was wonderful! There are huge jasmine bushes and the air smells amazing, and a fig tree was full of delicious fruit. The hosts and landlord were very friendly and helpful in meeting my needs.", "title": "Amazing views of the Umbrian hills!", "user": "Finnatic", "date": "August 16, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 19002893}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Umbria", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 1, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 16}, "aka": "Casale Santa Brigida: Art Monastery Guesthouse Umbria, Italy", "slim_ranking": 0.5, "description": "Become a temporary part of our international arts community!
