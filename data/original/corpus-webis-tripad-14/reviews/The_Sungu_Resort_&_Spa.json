This is a small place, located away from the main drag. You don't really want to hang out at the hotel all day because it's very small and there's only one restaurant. But there's not much to do or see around the hotel either. There's no beautiful countryside and there isn't much in the way of shops nearby either - you have to take the hotel shuttle to the town, which is gross. There's been A LOT of development in Ubud in recent years. There is very little rice paddy at this point and just a lot of villas, hotels, shops, hawkers and TRAFFIC. So unless you're staying at a big resort, it's hard to get away from all the development and noise. Our first room was close to the street and we were awoken by roosters from the vendor across the street every morning at dawn. We switched to a more expensive villa which solved the problem, but still, hours of sleep lost.
