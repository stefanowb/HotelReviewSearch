This time we wanted to stay right on the beach so the location was perfect. The hotel is run by two sisters and their brother. They provide a genuinely warm and personal welcome. The family have run the hotel for 80 years and many clients have been returning year after year. There wasn't a room available for us for the whole of our stay and so we were offered a 3 bedroom apartment for the same price which was excellent. Simple furniture and facilities but everything was in great condition. The hotel breakfast was very good. Dinner was a little disappointing. We tried the restaurant twice. It was OK on one occasion and very overcooked on the other. Its not their strong point. There are many other restaurants close by and we would recommend trying one of those.

It easy to be in... few restaurants, not noisy, etc... and what's best, great for kids! No cars around, so they can play with no risk, and you can enjoy a great white catalan wine on the terrace, right net to the beach. Just great! If you go to the restaurant, go for MUSCLOS a la VINAGRETA and PAELLA! And keep some empty spot on your stomag, since, the desserts could be the best... the tat\u00edn is amezing..............
