Best deal of a tough locale. I paid $120 for 1 night during the week and it was $25 dollars cheaper than anything in the area. Good but not great buffet bkfst, room are quite clean & a good size, two floor set-up with interior halls. Refridgerators, kitchenettes (with sink d/w and utensils) and seating areas in the rooms. Beds and climate control are both fine. The prob is that there are several bldgs. You register in the \"main bldg\" then schlepp your stuff to the bldg that your room's in. It's annoying to have to get back in the car to go to your room after you've gotten out of it to check in, but that's the deal. I got dropped off by cab, so I had to wander from the registration office to \"my\" bldg when I was tired, cranky and NOT in the mood.

The grounds were great, the rooms were great and the breakfast too! We first pulled up and my family began to compliment the outer appearance. When we arrived in our rooms, they were HUGE and there was a big den area, a nice size kitchen and eating area, and two bedrooms on each side with separate TVs. In total, there were three TVs. There was also a nice size bathroom with a big vanity area and a big closet. The beds were so soft that I almost cried when I had to get up! This looked like an apartment.
