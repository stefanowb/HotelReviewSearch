OK we fully understand that there is a different acceptability of noise in India than in Europe (say). But it is no good to us to pay for an expensive hotel and then not get a decent night's sleep. We spoke with the hotel management the next morning, and were told that either the guests would be moved to a different room or they would get their written confirmation that they would not move furniture around at night.
