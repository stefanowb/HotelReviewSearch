It was beautiful. There is staff EVERYWHERE, willing to help and open doors, and let you off the elevator first, and get you whatever you need and call you by your name. We came over after staying at Embassy Suites, which was a great great great hotel as well. I believe that the atmosphere here is a bit stuffy, with a lot of roaming business people who tend to make the ambiance pretty tense. When walking into the $22 p/person breakfast buffet (which was pretty good), we were sort of looked down upon. The stares we got by other guests were not at all friendly. Being from New York, it was very easy for us to laugh it off though. But it was still a very uncomfortable feeling for both my boyfriend and I. Anyway, the pool is absolutely breathtaking. Those chairs will put you right to sleep. Fresh citrus water and fruits were always available to keep you cool. The Ritz's private beach is a few steps from the pool and is just as beautiful. Since its a private beach, it is one the best places to relax. Go Kayaking or sailing. It is included with your stay and since you're on vacation, make the most of it. Don't forget to relax on the hammoks too. Although food is expensive, you have to expect it when you stay here. We ate at the hotel only once for the breakfast. We also ate at Denny's 1 day which was just around the corner. Plaza las Americas was a 15min. ride and perfect if it happens to rain. Some of the staff is friendly, while some offer their services with a fake smile...we tried to joke around to relax some of them, but I guess they are just not used to it. All in all, I think I would stay here again but only for an anniversary or special occasion. Despite the weird stares and tense atmosphere, it is a beautiful hotel, and the rooms definintly make you feel like royalty. I agree with 1 review, the water pressure wasn't all that high.

Although I rate the hotel five stars (excellent) on the rating scale, I did so only because the four star rating is for above average and in my opinion the hotel is closer to excellent than above average. Prior to arriving at the Ritz, we stayed two nights at the Marriott in Condado Beach. Although the Marriott now owns and/operates the Ritz Carlton chain, there is no comparison between the two properties. With that said, we did have an oceanfront room at the Marriott (which allowed us to sleep with the balcony doors open) and were unable to get one at the Ritz. However, that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. With the exception of a few rooms at the Ritz, none of them have balconies and the windows do not open and we were on the so-called garden-view side of the hotel at $550.00/night and the rooms facing the water were even pricier with no real added benefit. Some reviews talked about the hotel's proximity to the airport which is great when arriving and leaving any really had little, if any, effect on our stay. Although you could hear the occasional airplane taking off when at the pool, it was not a negative. Everthing that others are writing about the hotel is pretty accurate. The staff is as friendly as can be, the hotel and grounds are immaculate, the bathrooms and rooms are very nice and meals at the hotel are expensive. We were somewhat disappointed that our room (612) had a large coffee stain in the middle of the carpet and the carpet in general was somewhat dirty but after pointing this out, someone from the hotel quickly came and scrubbed out much of the coffee stain but truth be told, the entire carpet really needed to be cleaned. We had dinner two nights in the lobby restaurant which also allows you to order from the Chinese restaurant in the casino which we could not eat at because the kids are not allowed in the casino. The first dinner was great but the dinner order the second time was completely messed up (after waiting almost an hour to get it) and the hotel insisted on not charging us for the dinner which was nice. My only real complaint is that the pool did not appear to be heated and was very cold. In fact, the only people in the pool were kids and most guests (including the kids) simply used the jacuzzi. Perhaps in the summer a heated pool is unnecessary but not so in February.

We arrived at the hotel on a Thursday afternoon. As we stepped out of the taxi we were warmly greeted and our luggage quickly collected. In the short check-in line, tropical fruit juice and cold hand towels were waiting for us. We stayed in a standard room on the 3rd floor, which was spacious enough for myself, my wife, and our 14-month old daughter. The room had the standard comfortable beds, nice sheets, and quality bath amenities that you could expect from a Ritz, along with newly installed flat-panel TVs. We had a nice view of the gardens and some of the pool area, but had to crane our necks for the ocean view. Our requests for a refrigerator and a crib were met soon after we settled in, with an unsolicited offer from the porter to try and get us an upgraded room. Be aware that the hotel is close to the airport, so it is not a resort in the middle of nowhere, but rather an oasis in the city that might be subject to some runway noise. The beach is ok, with large hammocks and beach chairs available. The pool area is lovely, with plenty of available lounge chairs. The pool attendants were great, laying out towels, moving umbrellas and setting up the playpens/portable cribs that are available. One thing that surprised us was the number of people that went to the pool desk, got towels and avoided the attendants. Another surprise was the number of kids under 5 that were there over the weekend. We thought we'd be one of the only ones, but for those first few days, the pool area was full, with a good number of small kids. Throughout Sunday evening and Monday morning, many of the weekenders with kids packed up, and the hotel transitioned to a decidely more business, less leisure guest mix. This left the pool area more sparsly poulated and quiet for the remainder of our trip. Throughout our stay, the hotel was 95% full, but you could never tell. We found that the hotel did not nickel and dime on the whole, although there were some exceptions. For example, the hotel provided free bottled water in the rooms, with extra bottles available on request. Some items at the pool like soft drinks and fries were actually reasonable for a luxury hotel. On the other hand, the $6 ice cream bar was a bit excessive. Breakfast was $23, expensive if you are eating at home, but what you might expect at a quality hotel with a fairly comprehensive buffet. You can also order specific entrees like 2 eggs, toast and hash browns for $10, but order anything additional (juice, cereal, etc.) and it starts to make sense to pay for the buffet and have all the variety. The concierge was helpful in arranging babysitting, dinner reservations, and providing general travel information. What really made our trip was the responsive service level provided by the entire staff. We were always greeted with a warm hello or good morning. Virtually no request was refused, and service was delivered promptly and always with a smile and \"my pleasure\". To put it simply, much of the staff knew our daughter by name, and seemed to genuinely enjoy playing with her, and seeing to our needs. Overall, I would say this ranks among the top hotels I have stayed in. If you are looking for a more isolated location, or a self-enclosed megaresort this is not the place for you.

Everything is very close, the pool, the beach, the gym, etc and yet it does not feel cramped at all. The gym / spa are excellent. Massages are top notch and the facility is very clean. My wife took many classes at the gym while we were there. I took a tennis clinic with Miguel and really enjoyed it. It was hard to book time with him for lessons so do in advance. We ate at BLT and it was awesome. Food and service were great. Skipped Mulino's. Interesting where they put Mulino's. It is located in the casino where the big screen tv / bar used to be. Kind of a bummer that the bar is no longer there. It was nice when you wanted to take a break from the tables, plus on Sunday's you could watch the football games there. They made a lounge upstairs, but its out of the way and I never saw anybody in it my whole stay (I think they should have put Mulino's upstairs).

I stayed at the Ritz Carlton from Nov 28 - Dec 2. The first 2 days we held a business meeting there and we were all impressed with the hotel rooms, the meeting rooms and the service. The meeting rooms had wireless internet service and the business lunches were very good. The corporate rate was amazing: $165 (it amounted to $200 after taxes and resort fee, which is still a great deal). We didn\u2019t get a room with a balcony, but the rooms still had a combination water view/pool view. Our prior meeting was held at the Caribe Hilton and this is a much better place to go for a meeting. We had dinner at the Italian restaurant in the hotel (Il Mulino)\u2013 very good and very expensive. The portions are extremely large, so if you\u2019re in a group I suggest sharing entrees or ordering the appetizer sized portions. The last 2 days of my trip my sister joined me for a few days of vacation. I was able to get the corporate rate for the remaining 2 days \u2013 what a deal! I got a pedicure at the spa \u2013 even though I e-mailed my request for a spa treatment without the 24-hour notice, they were able to accommodate me at the requested time. The posted rate was $75 but it ended up costing around $95 by the time they added tip and tax. This was the most I have spent on a pedicure \u2013 I hope it lasts. The spa service was friendly and professional. The fitness center was great and the classes were very good \u2013 not easy at all. If you take a few classes a day you are bound to return fitter than you arrived. Most of the cardio equipment had their own TVs. All headphones were cleaned after use. Water bottles and fresh towels were placed on all pieces of equipment, and the instructors would hand out cold bottles. The one negative about the fitness center was they only had 2 elliptical machines (which everyone wanted to use), and they were very much in need of service, making loud banging noises if someone used them. I found the noise quite annoying while I was exercising - They should have placed \u201cout of service\u201d notices on them. The pool and the beach were nice. There was just one pool and one hot tub, but there always seemed to be available chairs. There were always lots of towel guys hanging around to find you a chair. My only complaint about the pool area was the lack of beverage/food service. There were only a few people taking food and drink orders \u2013 not enough to cover everyone. Not one approached us to ask us if we wanted something \u2013 we had to chase them down or go to the bar and order on our own. I found this surprising because the ratio of hotel service people to guests was extremely high throughout the rest of the hotel \u2013 twice when I asked how to find something ( a restaurant or meeting room), someone took the time to walk me there. The rooms were nice. The air conditioning was adjustable and there were flat screen TVs and free internet. The one thing we didn\u2019t like about the rooms was the lack of an internal privacy lock and lack of \u201cdo not disturb\u201d signs (called \u201cshh\u201d signs in the hotel). Our room did not have a \u201cshh\u201d sign, and a member of the housekeeping staff walked in on my sister while she was getting dressed. We then asked for a \u201cshh\u201d sign for the door, which disappeared the next day (perhaps taken by another guest who needed one). I would prefer a privacy lock on the door. I had an evening flight, and the hotel provides \u201cchanging rooms\u201d rather than let you check out beyond 1:30 PM. Overall, this was a very nice hotel, which is why I\u2019m taking the time to write this, and I would definitely go back. This hotel is highly recommended for business travel and for a business meeting location. It\u2019s also a nice place for vacation travelers who aren\u2019t pinching pennies and are OK with $24 breakfasts and $14 pina coladas.", "title": "Amazing Relaxing Thanksgiving", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "PlateMan", "date": "November 28, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6230410, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Everything, but picking one the staff", "disliked": "\u2014 waking up early to get pool chairs"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "Intro:", "title": "The Perfect Honeymoon Hotel", "user": "9brady", "date": "November 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 6161224, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 service", "disliked": "\u2014 the San Juan Hotel and Casino is within walking distance."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "We stayed at the Ritz June 23rd-28th, 2006.

We arrived in San Juan and checked in at the El San Juan (hotel next to Ritz) - at 3 am, with music still blaring from the pool deck keeping my husband and I awake, I called the Ritz and booked the rest of our vacation with them.

At the discounted rate, this was a great hotel. But if I had paid $400+ a night, I would have been pretty upset and bitter about the whole situation. The hotel room is a typical Ritz Carlton room, and has a large bathroom and a flat screen tv. Very few rooms have balconies and the windows don't look like they've been washed in 10 years. But the real problem with the room is that you can literally hear everything in the neighboring rooms. If your neighbors decide to watch tv at 2:00 am, then you will hear it. If your neighbors have a baby and it decides to cry in the night (happened twice for me), you will wake up too. If you want to sleep until 10 am and your neighbors wake up at 7 am and decide to have a normal conversation, you will not be sleeping in that morning. Its like being in a motel! That being said, the pool is gorgeous (but crowded on the weekends) and the beach is really nice too. We had hit or miss service in terms of getting beverage service at the beach/pool. I think its because its a little understaffed. Given I paid less than $200 a night, that was ok with me. If I had paid double the price.... then it would have been upsetting. The beach water isn't quite as pretty as other Caribbean islands. Oh, and its a $19 taxi ride each way into Old San Juan, which adds up! And a $17 per day resort fee, which is sneaky, in my opinion. While the food at the hotel was pricey, I didn't think it was any more outrageous than any other resort hotel. Given all this, I would definitely go back as long as I could book at a discount.
