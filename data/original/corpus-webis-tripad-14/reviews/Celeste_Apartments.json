Really is a 2 minute walk (at most) to the beach which is clean and white and lovely!

Talking of drinks best place was Christos (happy hour 7-10 big measures on shorts and cheap) also Bluebells on the same square only 1.5 Euros a pint all day long,Nice chill out bar with sofas was Orient Express also on same square happy hours San Miquil 1.5 Euros,Best place for breakfast by far was the Highlander huge plateful for only 3.0 Euros not bad for Karoke on a night time if you like that sort of thing. This was our first time to Lanzatote and would recommend hiring a car for 2-3 days to tour all of island,we found best deal with Direct Car Hire 45 Euros for 2 days (cheaper the longer you hire for)this included fully comp insurence others dont qoute this so what looks a good deal in the window soon adds up once inside.Food - best for us and most other people judging by popularity of restuarant was El Patio not the cheapest but was very good food and service, on the same square as the bars (square with bandstand in middle and market on fridays)", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "simonandlauraBristol", "date": "February 29, 2008", "id": 13931516}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We booked to stay in the Celeste Apts two days before we travelled, at the end of January.", "title": "Cheap price - great location", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "CathP", "date": "February 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 13836748, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Dated apartment"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "We just wanted some winter sun, and a nice break.", "title": "Pleasant and good location", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Gladioli", "date": "January 31, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 13140867}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Mary Burke Kildare Ireland We stayed at the Celeste in Aug 2007.
