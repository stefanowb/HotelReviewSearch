Solo and his wife are the owners of this three bungalows. A very nice and \u2018especially\u2019 helpful couple. The bungalows are about a ten-minute drive from the airport and located on a virtually private beach. You are just far enough from the airport to not to be bothered by it. The bungalows are more than we hoped for. They are quite new, modern, \u2018clean\u2019 and with \u2018fully\u2019 equipped kitchens. As a lover for cooking the kitchen did fulfill more of my wishes. Everything you need in a temporary house was there. The only thing we missed was a telephone for emergencies. The bungalows are far from town so it is very handy to rent a pushbike, scooter or car. Solo is always helpful to arrange one for you. The only things that are close by is the local disco where everybody can be found on a Friday night and there is Puffy\u2019s with a restaurant also on walking distance.", "helpfulness": 20, "user": "MikeInOhio", "date": "November 15, 2005", "id": 4112946}], "location": {"country": "Cook Islands", "continent": "South Pacific"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 11, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 17}, "aka": "Aitutaki Seaside Hotel Aitutaki", "slim_ranking": 0.615384615385}
