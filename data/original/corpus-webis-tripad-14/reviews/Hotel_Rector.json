If you went in cooler months you would not mind the walk. The hotel it self was very hard to find. There were signs posted for all the other hotels except this one and we drove past it a few times as its location is not what you'd expect and the sign on the building is very small.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "janisc", "date": "October 17, 2005", "id": 4028174}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "The last review on Hotel Rector on tripadvisor doesn't sound like the Hotel Rector.

The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and clean. The marble bathroom was spectacular. The hotel is very charming with hardwood floors in the reception area. It is very clean also....even the carpets and bedspreads. It is a small hotel and quiet. You feel like you're the only one there. The owners/hosts were very pleasant. Our room was refreshed after our afternoon siesta everday. The only drawback was that not everyone spoke English at the front desk. They did their best to try and understand and help however and would try to find someone that did speak English to help. Also, as a small hotel, there weren't any organized tours or excusions. Salamanca is a beautiful, clean city, with much to see and enjoy at a relaxed pace. Hotel Rector is a wonderful place to stay to enjoy the city.
