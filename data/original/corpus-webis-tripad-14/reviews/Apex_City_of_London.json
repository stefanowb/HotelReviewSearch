This hotel is mainly suited for the business traveler which is why it's located in the business district. My husband and I went to London for a weekend getaway, and loved the hotel. We stayed in a basic room for around 90 pounds per night. The room itself was small, but the bed was a King, and we had room to walk around. There is a flat screen t.v. on the wall with a dvd player, but remember it only plays the UK region. We happened to have a U.S. movie and it didn't work. The bathroom is HUGE for European standards. What impressed me the most (and I know this is probably insignificant to most readers) is that they had shampoo AND conditioner! All other countries only give you shampoo, which is frustrating when you don't want to pack your own products for weekend trips. The design of the room is incredibly nice for the price and this hotel could probably charge a lot more and still get as many reservations.", "user": "MissSUk", "date": "July 9, 2008", "id": 17686575}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011", "text": "This gem of a hotel in The City is one of London's pleasant surprises.

A while after our first drink, my husband started to say something to me but stopped - to which I paid no heed until he realised a little later that two women beside us had seen what he was about to tell me about - mice - running freely around the bar area. We mentioned this to the bar and restaurant staff and their response was amazing. They were totally aware of it and were prepared to do nothing about it - one of them asked did we expect them to kill an animal. The girl dealing with the restaurant was extremely rude saying that as long as it wasn't rats she didn't care. When I pointed out that the mice could run around glasses, pourers on the bottles, nuts that were being given out she just said there were no mice in the kitchens which I told her I didn't believe. We watched the mice come in and out through a gap in the internal walls so I can only imagine that they are in other places throughout the hotel. The duty manager eventually came over and tried to diffuse the issue but we just left after a heated discussion as he maintained he didn't know the mice were there even though the bar and restaurant staff were fully aware of it - I don't think so.
