First, we had stayed at Mercures before while travelling in Europe, they are a chain hotel in Europe part of Accor hotels, also belonging are Ibis which are more basic. Also, the reviews sounded good. This hotel is close to most things however you have to take public transit to get there. When we arrived, the main train station was under construction therefore we arrived into the Bahnhof Miedling and it was 3 subways to get to this hotel. Their subway system in Vienna is very easy to understand and it\u2019s very efficient so even though we had to change trains a few times it still took only about 20-30 minutes max from when we got off our train and then into the hotel. The stop on the subway that is the closest is Schweder Platz. From there it is a 10 minute walk to the hotel along a sidewalk and the river. I can understand people not wanting to stay here because of the necessity to take public transit but honestly it was very easy to do and it did not take away anything from our stay.", "title": "nice hotel, need to take u-bahn to downtown.", "user": "Ilovetotravel73", "date": "December 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 147639753}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The main sights in Vienna are easily accessible by subway and you can see the steeple of the main church from the street where the hotel is.

I found the rooms quite large and certainly comfortable with good internet connection as well as access to a free computer downstairs. When we were unable to get to breakfast one morning due to an early rise to catch the train to Budapest, the hotel gladly provided us with a packed lunch. A free welcome drink was provided on arrival and the reception was always helpful and available. I particularly liked ther hotel's location, only a five minute walk to the underground station and a ten to fifteen minute walk to the cathedral.
