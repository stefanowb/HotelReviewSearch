Up here the views of the surrounding woodland are amazing and it feels a little more like more basic camping. But I really didn't like the other fields. Lots of organised rows with hedges overlooking your car and right into your opposite neighbours tent. Some rows were really ugly hard standing - I know you need this if you're caravanning, but it just wasn't pretty. Piddle Patch has a slight slope - no big deal and a road that runs to the right hand side. It's a country road so expect intermittent traffic noise, some loud and if you're next to the road be prepared with ear plugs if you feel the road noise will bother you. It's a trek from the nearest facilities. This field could seriously do with another set of toilets up that end.", "title": "beautiful caravan park", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "sarah m", "date": "June 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131361124}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012", "text": "Which leads me nicely onto the subject of toilets - I've stayed in basic sites with one portaloo that was cleaner than this.

Booked through Hoseasons, we stayed in a 6 berth Mendip Champagne caravan. They also sell a strawberry champagne caravan but I think they are the same except for one is 4 berth & Mendip is 6 berth. The site is very well kept with a very large area for tourers & campers. It has a nice club house with games rooms & area with pool tables. There are lots of other things on the site but I will tell you what we thought, rather than something you can find out yourself on their website. At this time of year, it is not too busy, so absolutely fine but I would imagine that in peak season, the club house would not be big enough for the size of this site. The caravans are perfectly adequate, a little dated but very clean & in good working order. However, if you are tall or large (or both) the beds are too small. This is probably the norm in most statics now but it may be worth paying extra and taking a look at their lodges if you like a bigger bed. Also the caravans are really close together, we could just get our car between the 2 spaces of the caravans, so you are talking maybe 7 feet apart. The caravans all have a little decking area which is really nice and the site is very clean. Out of season, this site is lovely and a 3 night price of \u00a395 was a bargain, just be mindful of how close the caravans are and you will not be disappointed.", "title": "Weekend with Hoseasons.

We asked if any other vans were available and were told that they didn 't have anything not even a 2 bed van to give us. We could not sleep in that van When we demanded a return of our money, which we had already paid on booking, the manageress informed us that it was not the policy of the site to give any returns. I then asked to speak to someone else I was told there was no-one. The name of the owners were refused. When I threatened court action as they were not supplying what they advertised we were asked to return the following morning and she would see what she could do. The next day suddenly there was a 2 bedroomed, 12 ft van available, which was acceptable (but still without central heating) but we agreed to take it as we could not afford the cost of other accommodation We found that the car was not allowed outside the van, as advertised and we had to carry our cases over grass for some distance. We are both seniors. We only stayed 3 nights of our 10 booked (having spent the first night in B & B ) as we were so cold during the night.
