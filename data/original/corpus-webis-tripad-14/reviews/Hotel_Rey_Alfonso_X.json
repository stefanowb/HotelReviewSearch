We booked into the Rey Alfonso hotel for 2 nights. Firstly finding the hotel was like finding a needle in a hay stack! And I guess not having a detailed map did not help. After trawling through the old town streets of seville for over 1 hour and asking numerous people for directions we arrived at the hotel tired,sweaty and hungry. The front desk person did not seem friendly or empathetic about our situation. After we got our room keys and check out our room we instantly realised that it was uncomfortably warm in the room and when we turned the air conditioning on only to find the A/C was blowing out hot air! We called reception to inform them of this problem only for them to explain to us that they were not planning to fix their air conditioning until su mmer time...I can only imagine how hot it gets in summer if its like this in spring and it was 29 degrees! They suggested we open the window which we did only to find it was awfully noisy from the street sounds and construction work taking place outside the hotel. Due to the very loud noises coming from outside, we then asked them if they could provide us with a fan to which they said they would look into but never called us back. As were about to step out that night we tried to explain to the same front desk person of our situation that due to the uncomfortably hot conditions in our hotel room and the fact the A/C was not working, we did try to open the window to which we would be affected by a terribly loud construction and restaurant/street noise at night and they did not provide us with a portable fan, we requested to be moved to a quieter room. The front desk person's response was that the street noise would die down later in the night and the construction work would stop and that all the rooms in the hotel are the same in terms of noise level ( which i did not believe one bit!) and concluding that all rooms were fully booked they were unable to move us to another room. We were not happy with this response and said we would see how the night went and would take this up with them in the morning if this was an on-going issue. As expected we were forced to open the window as it was very hot and we were kept up ALL night (I mean all night) with the construction work noises and loud restaurant/street noise which didn't stop until early dawn. I must have woken up least 8 times during the night and had 2 hours sleep altogether. Feeling extremley sleep deprived the next morning we spoke to recepetion (a different front desk person) explaining we were kept up all night with the terrible noise and insisted we get moved to a quiter room. The front desk person did explain they were fully booked that night but agreed they would move us to one of the back rooms which would be much more QUIETER. To our relief we moved rooms straight away and that night with still no air condittioning we were able to sleep soundly through out the night with out any irritating street/construction noise. See it doesn't take that much to tend to a small request which makes a big difference in a unpleasant stay to a pleasant stay.
