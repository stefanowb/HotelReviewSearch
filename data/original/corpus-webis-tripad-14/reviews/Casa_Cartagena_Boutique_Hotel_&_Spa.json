I was visiting in Cusco and had many friends that I would have like to entertain in my room for drinks and conversation. Certainly in any other city, Paris or New York or London this would be normal. But not here....I suspect that there was a predjudice because my friends were native Peruvians and seemingly not fancy people.

It proved to be a good choice. We reserved a \"balcony suite,\" although it was not really a suite. The rooms open to a beautiful courtyard with a fountain, and outside seating is available there for the restaurant. The buffet breakfast was one of the best we had in South America. There were many appetizing fresh pastries and fruit was abundant. The hot chocolate was perhaps better than Angelina's in Paris! The hotel employees are extremely friendly and eager to please. There are a few glitches to be worked out--the lighting in the room was dim and inadequate, the refrigerator/minibar was not operating, and the pillows were foam (with no feather alternative available). The hotel is located about 2 blocks higher than Monasterio on a steep hill and it can be a difficult climb if the altitude is affecting you.
