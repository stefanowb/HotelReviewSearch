First many people complained about being close to the airport, the noise of the jets did not bother us at all. The staff actually makes a joke out of it by waving to the planes as they fly over. Yes the resort is older but it is immaculant. Also I saw that some complained about wild cats, I only saw one cat during our stay. Also you will encounter locals on the beach trying to sell you stuff, just treat them with respect and they will do the same. We stayed in a conceirge suite on the third floor of the almond block of building. The room was very spacious and nice with a great veiw of the ocean. The in room bar consisted of various fruit juice drinks, Regular and Diet Coke, Sprite, Red Stripe, Red wine, White wine, Champagne in a mini fridge, and a litre of Vodka, Appleton Rum, Clan Mcgregor Scotch, old time gin in a dispensor above the fridge. All of the bars at the resort are fully stocked but if you order a drink and do not specify you will receive rum as the liquor. Also Red Stripe and Stripe light is the beer, Miller Lite and Corona (as was red bull) were available for purchase in the gift shop. The beach was very well kept and spacious. There were always plenty of lounge chairs and towels available. The watersports were great. The staff and playmakers were always smiling and helpful. I lost my sunglasses at the beach one day and was very happy to find them at he lost and found desk a few hours later. Just be reminded that everyone (except the cab drivers) works on Island time, which the motto is 'No worries, No hurries' but your on vacation so just sit back and enjoy. The food was good, we especially liked the Italian restaurant and the omelette bar for breakfast in the bayside. My wife who is very, very picky about what she eats always found something that she liked. The restaurants no longer accept revervations but we did not wait longer than 30 minutes. I would rate Sandals Montego Bay as a 5 out of 5 and we will hopefully be returning for another vacation.", "title": "Montego Bay Honeymoon", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "worrelldx", "date": "January 2, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 23204142}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This was the first experience with Sandals resorts.

Once again, we had a great time and are already planning our December 09 trip \"home\". We stayed in a Bay Roc room with the butler service, our first trip with a butler, and would highly recommend it. If you find yourself at MOBAY, do yourself a favor and ask for \"Craig the Butler\". After 8 nights, we wanted to bring him home with us to LA. He had an uncanny knack of showing up when we needed something, we almost never had to call him. He took care of everything we asked for with a great smile and sense of humor that made for a most enjoyable experience. We miss him most of all from our visit. We would also like to thank Kimone who cooked us perfect omlets every morning and always had a big smile for us. And Nasha, who seemed to work everywhere all the time, was a pleasure to spend time with. These two young ladies were always pleaseant and made us feel like family, not just guests at a hotel. Thanks girls! The resort is good sized and it is easy to find a nice quiet corner to sit back, relax and enjoy the Jamaican surf. Having the Butler service indeed has its advantages, including the abilty to \"reserve\" your dinner times (even though they do not officially take reservations anymore) we were always able to walk right in and have a table ready for us.....Thanks to \"Craig the Butler!\" The private candlelight dinner under the gazebo was wonderful and really should not be missed. Thanks to our special waiter Ronald for his attention and an unforgetable version of Louie Armstrongs \"What a Wonderful World\". We also highly recommend the couples massage at the Red Lane Spa. We have enjoyed their services each visit to Sandals and have always had a wonderful experience. Try the Heart Rock massage for 2...you will not be sorry. Another treat was the ATV tour to the hills above Rose Hall. The tour guides were very fun and the views were spectacular. Thanks to all at Chukka Tours.
