We had never been before but had heard of its reputation with previous top chefs working there. On entering the hotel lobby we had no idea where to go. The place was deserted. I went over to reception but the receptionist was on the phone. My husband then went into a small bar where he found one member of staff serving a couple, the only other people in the bar. She took our name and said we could have a drink here before going through to the dining room. Our table had been booked for 1.30, the only time available at the time of phoning but I find this puzzling as the place was so quiet. We waited quite a while for our drink orders to be taken - first choice of draught beer for my son was off so he was offered Tribute which he accepted. The staff memebr had to go somewhere else for this, I don't know why but she was gone some time. My husband and I ordered orange juice, again she had to leave the bar to get a jug of orange juice! Eventually our drinks were served and we were offered the menus. Finally at 1.55 we decided to go to our table as the bar staff member had disappeared and we were left on our own. Once in the restaurant the staff were excellent. The food was good although we did pass commnet on the roast potatoes which were horrible. Huge potatoes with tough skins and very dry inside. It is a shame that our initital experience was not positive but I do feel front of house staff need to be a little more attentive when people arrive. Not sure that we will return which is a shame because the restaurant staff were trying very hard and the chef is obviously very talented but when I go out for a special meal I expect a little more than what the Castle was offering.", "title": "Lack of welcome", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Gemima", "date": "December 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 147102338}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with friends", "text": "A group of friends and I have just had the most beautiful evening, including a top class, four course meal with all the Christmas trimmings and excellent service.
