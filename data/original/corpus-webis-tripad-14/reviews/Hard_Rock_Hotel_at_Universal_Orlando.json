We had a great time. We stayed at the Hard Rock the whole time. It can't be beat for location. Its 5 minutes from the entrance to universal, and 7 minutes from either the farthest corner of City walk, or the other theme Park, Islands of Adventure. Rock Music permeates the facility. We liked this (although there was not enough Led Zeppelin... but thats our taste). Nevertheless, the rooms are quiet. We stayed on the 7th floor (the concierge level). We arrived at the Orlando Airport at 10:15 AM. The pick up service was great (Quick Transportation is the name of the company). They met us at the airport, had a sign with our name... it was very convenient. They were also very reliable in taking us back to the airport at the end of the week. This service kills Disney's Mears transportation. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 11:30 AM and our room was not ready. We spent the next 4 hours in the Parks, we got a voice message that our room was ready and we went back to the hotel to unwind. Our entourage included me (Dad) and my 15 year old and 11 year old sons. We had originally ordered a deluxe room with 2 queen size beds and a pullout couch. We got upgraded to the concierge level (I'm not sure why) with the same bed configuration. The room is big, clean, and comfortable. There is a high grade stereo table top radio that has a very good sound and has an attachment for an IPOD, something my 15 year old immediately took advantage of. The sound is almost as good as a Bose table radio. The large LCD TV was great. The 2 queen beds are very very comfortable, but the pullout couch (regular size bed), was uncomfortable even with a second mattress and comforter under the sleeper (both requested when we realized how uncomfortable this pullout was). Unfortunately, even my 11 year old could not sleep on it. We took turns. The hotel said they did not have a regular mattress to put on the pullout couch. The pool looks picturesque (see the brochure) but it is a novelty pool. You really can't swim in it... at least not very much. The deepest portion is a little over 4 feet, but most of the pool is about 3 ft deep or less. Yes there are underwater speakers, but it ended up not being that big a deal after the 8th time we dunked our head under the water to listen. The long slide (also advertised) is very long, but not steep. Adults have trouble getting started unless they lie down in the begining of the run. Pool side entertainment during the late afternoon is geared towards the under 10 crowd (i.e hula hoop contests and adults are excluded). There is a few nights of poolside movies after 8 PM and a few nights of live poolside rock music. The live music is okay, my son recognized the names of the groups, I didn't. When I booked the hotel (through Universal vacation package), I was told that there is a shuttle service between Sea World and \"Wet and Wild\" (the associated water park), so I bought the 4 park 14 day tickets. Well I guess there is a shuttle (I was thinking Disney), but I was mislead. The shuttle leaves the hotel at 9:55 AM to go to the water park and sea world and subsequently leaves Sea World at 7:00 PM and Wet and Wild at 5:00 PM. Thats right one pickup and one return (not every 20 or 30 minutes as I incorrectly envisioned). The bus (also unlike disney) has a sign encouraging the riders to tip the bus driver when they arrive at their destination. The taxi ride one way to Sea World is $15,50, and $5.50 to Wet and Wild (without a tip). We took the bus once to sea world, but after that we took taxi's. The hotels restaurants are excellent. The \"Kitchen's\" (name of one of the restaurants) breakfast buffet is as good as any upmarket breakfast and fits the quality of the hotel, The Steak at the \"Palm\" restaurant was remarkable for its taste and tenderness... and it was cooked \"medium well\" as requested.", "title": "Its Rock and Roll", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "jdrnd", "date": "May 6, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7552794, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the location", "disliked": "\u2014 the pullout couch"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Service was excellent.

It was convenient to be able to run over to the concierge lounge at any point in the day and get a good cup of coffee. We would stay at this hotel again (and plan to), but not for 8 days. We will skip the concierge level unless given to us again. Although not part of this hotel review, what we did discover is that there is not enough to do at Universal properties to last 8 days, but the details of this are for another review. Our room key allowed us to go to the head of the line for almost every ride... NO WAITS. This perk alone is worth staying on property. Think about this, there are about 9 real rides per park, 10 minutes per ride, and no wait. How long do you think it takes to go on every ride in both parks.

The hotel's location is excellent! Extremely convenient for Universal Studios and a good location for other Orlando attractions as well. The atmosphere is fun and laid back. The pool is fantastic!! A couple of years ago they improved the pool seating by designating smoking areas, so you didn't have your lounging by the pool constantly ruined by smoke from people next to you. The rooms are nicely appointed and a good size. Each room has a full bath (sink, tub/shower, and toilet) plus an additional sink outside the main bathroom. This can make getting ready a little faster. The staff is attentive and polite with a \"rocker\" appearance. The boat shuttles work well, but won't run if there's a storm in the area (lightning). The walk to Universal is 5-10 minutes and the walk to Islands of Adventure is 8-12 depending on your speed. We typically arrive, check in, park the car and basically leave it until we're ready to check out. If you need something there are a couple of restuarants on Kirkman. ou can get to them by turning on Major Drive. Also, there's a Target just a couple of exits east on I-4 by the Mall of the Millenia. My only complaint (and it's minor) is that they really like their parking. It's ~$16/night for self-park.

All the Universal hotels are awesome, particularly the hard rock. I like the Royal Pacific the most, as it has the least amount of children running around and screaming, but the Hard Rock is my favorite as far as ambience. If you are a music fan, the memoribilia alone will keep you busy for hours. We LOVE being able to take our 2 small dogs with us and will not stay in a hotel where we can't take the mutts. They cater to pet lovers and we reward them with our continued business. The hotel itself is the definition of cool. Modeled after the eagles hotel california it is almost like a rock stars palatial estate. The restaurants and bars are always great and the bartenders are super cool and generous with the tequila. The Hard Rock music venue is easily walkable an we always stay at the hard rock when we go there and see a show. The performers stay at the hard rock hotel and you can usually catch them hanging in the Velvet bat after the show. My wife got to meet Bonnie Raitt when she performed there and we drank with the band after the show. We have stayed on the universal properties about 15-20 times in the last 5 years and have loved it every time. Unlike the enormous Disney, Universal is centered around the closely located base of Universal city walk. You can easily walk from any of the hotels to any of the theme parks and restaurants in about 5 minutes. they also have water taxis if you donlt want to walk and sweat to death in july and august. Emerils Tchoup Chop at the royal pacific is amazing and even the theme restaurants like margaritaville are great. Universal feels like a connected small town that you can walk.The lone drawback is the pool at the hard rock...it is so cool that everyone that stays in any of the 3 hotels at universal usually ends up at the hard rock pool. It is HUGE and has a great water slide. If you want to relax an enjoy it though, forget it. Even the hot tubs are full of 8-14 year olds. if you enjoy hearing \"like\" 17 times in each sentence and unsupervised children splashing hot tub water up your nose, it's right up your alley. We usually truck on over to the royal pacific and kick back in their pool even when we stay at the hard rock. room servce is great as well. If you want to go to the parks, staying at the universal hotels is MUST. Even though it expensive to stay there, imaging being able to be in your room 5-10 minutes after leaving the park exhausted AND your room key lets you take the hotel entrance and bypass all the regular schlubs standing in line for rides.

The hotel was as expected and as described on its web site. The pool was great, lots of space to lounge, have a drink and watch the kids swim safely. There was also a life guard on duty to ease any nerves. My daughter was able to paddle around the baby pool happily and the larger pool has a gently sloping side to it, making it easy for her to get in and out of. My only negative about the pool, was the pool service for drinks for food took far too long. They seemed to have plenty of staff, it just took forever for them to bring you your order and then bring you your check. We stayed on club level 7, which has a lounge for breakfast, which is well worth the extra cost as it saved us having to go out and find food so early in the morning. In the evening they had happy hour from 5-7, but it was a bit of a scrum to be honest, with lots of people jostling for food - snacks, appetizers etc and free wine and beer. So we gave it a miss after our first attempt to get some cookies for the kids. We ate at the kitchen restaurant twice, once indoors and once on the patio, which was much nicer. The food here was good, with excellent service and good childrens choices. I would say the best thing about staying here was the ability to use your room key to bypass all the lines. We never stood in line for any rides, it was really fantastic. My kids loved it. I would say if you are coming to Universal, stay on property as the extra cost is very much worth it for convenience, especially with kids and no waiting in line The walk from our hotel to the park took less than 10 minutes, it was very scenic, or you could take the water shuttle, which was only 2 mins. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who is visiting Orlando as even if you want to visit Disney, you could do so by car from here - which we did on one of our days. Great hotel, great location, nice staff and wonderful places to eat. One tip - don't bother eating at the Hard Rock Cafe - food and service was awful. I would recommend the Mythos restaurant in the park though for lunch - really was awesome, great food and not too expensive.

It is a graduated entrance to the pool so it was easy to lay down in the water. My younger son enjoyed the waterslide, and the afternoon dj was great and kept everyone entertained. It appeared the younger kids would have a great time playing pool games. The drinks were good, although they probably could have used a few more servers. I had to track them down each time I wanted something. I only saw the waiter about 3 times in the 7 hours I was at the pool which was surprising. One thing that impressed me was that they added in 18% service charge at the pool, which is understandable, but they made a point of telling us to make it clear the service charge was added. Many times they conveniently forget to tell you this, but it let me know this hotel was not trying to pull anything over on you which was great.", "title": "Good hotel for parks and location", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Mark W", "date": "August 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136798848}], "location": {"country": "United States"}, "stars": 5, "variance": {"poor": 140, "average": 285, "very good": 882, "terrible": 78, "excellent": 1542}, "aka": "Hard Rock Hotel Orlando", "slim_ranking": 0.164133738602, "detail_rating": {"service": 4.5, "cleanliness": 4.5, "value": 4.5, "sleep": 4.5, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "description": "Live like a rock 'n' roll superstar at the exciting Hard Rock Hotel at Universal Orlando\u00ae You\u2019ll feel like rock 'n' roll royalty with impeccable accommodations, a wealth of recreation and personal service and attention fit for an \"A-List\" celebrity.
