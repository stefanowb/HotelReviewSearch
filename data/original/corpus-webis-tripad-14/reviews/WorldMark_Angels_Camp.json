I overheard the desk people tell some couples who checked in after us that they were getting a wonderful view of the golf course! When I spoke with the front desk, they basically blew me off with the shrugged shoulder look. ANyway, the unit had been remodeled, with typically dull decor. The stove was unlevel, the door to the deck squeaked, and a smoke detector was going off when we opened ther front door. The maintenace guy was there within minutes of our call and replaced batteries. It was great to have a fireplace but the place smelled of propane after we lit it and decided against running it. Again, maintenance was right there to check for leaks.....the maintenance guys should be running that whole place. Great to have a washer/dryer in the unit and the bed was very confortable. At night, the window coverings (blinds) did not darken the room and the light from the parking lot was annoying. There's a couple of pools on property and coffee in the lobby (most of the time). Free access to computers and parking right outside the unit. All in all a good stay, but when I'm promised something, I expect to get it. I keep my word and so should they. Oh, obe nore thing, they charge you what I think they call a \"room use tax\" which, for our one bedroom was $91.70 for the week. When I asked about this, they blamed it on the state and said that guests are to pay the difference in tax the state loses since you are paying less for the room than if you stayed at a hotel. SO, in other words, the GREAT deal we get because we are timeshare owners is assessed a penalty because we didn't pay retail for a hotel.

The resort is off the main highway on the edge of a golf course, so it's quiet. There is a nice pool at the rec center. There are no restaurants on site but you have a choice within a short drive. The second floor units have the master bedroom on an upper level, and there is no vent to it -- only a ceiling fan. Since hot air rises, this means that the master tends to be difficult to cool on a hot day without freezing the quarters downstairs.

On the way to Yosemite there are several simple but good restaurants (Cross County Cafe, and a restaurant with a great view in Priest, all by itself on top of a hill). Nice pool and hot tub as well as pool table and ping pong available in the club house. Yah, the timeshare sales pitch was a bit annoying but they eventually understand the word \"no thanks\".

It's under 3 hours from our house in Marin County so driving toward warmth and a dry clime is easy.
