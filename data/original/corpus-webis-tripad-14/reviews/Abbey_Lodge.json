My one piece of advice would be for some renewing of some of the decor in the bedrooms. A simple change to nice clean, bright white comforter and some brighter decor would give a very updated feel to Abbey Lodge that it needs. It has such a charming character about it on the outside and has so much potential inside. Overall though, a very nice, clean and centrally located place in Killarney that I would recommend.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "mag1007", "date": "May 11, 2007", "id": 7589012}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2003, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we arived in Killarney we saw the lodge and my wife said if we we would get a room in the arch she would love to stay there what does a loving man...just walk in and ask if there is a vacancy..", "title": "very nice", "helpfulness": 9, "user": "luizcifer", "date": "March 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 7009783}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "go it right away...wife happy...me happy....so we stayed 7 nights..", "title": "Oops, we forget to plan this part.", "helpfulness": 12, "user": "IOB", "date": "February 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 6818313, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The clean, spacious room.The great amounts hot water, and the quiet.", "disliked": "\u2014 Only having a few days to spend there."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "everybody was very nice and friendly...the breakfast was great...if i ever return to Killarney my first choice would be the lodge and not a 4 or 5 star hotel", "title": "A wonderful stay", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Mr.Bunnyman", "date": "February 11, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6778887, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location, value, welcoming", "disliked": "\u2014 having to go home"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with family", "text": "take care", "title": "Disappointing", "user": "Bamaroy", "date": "September 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5797756, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location to town, breakfast", "disliked": "\u2014 lack of warmth from host and staff"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Warm and Welcoming", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Abbey Lodge last November.
