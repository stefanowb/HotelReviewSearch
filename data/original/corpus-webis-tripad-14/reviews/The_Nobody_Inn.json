We had a cold buffet and were meant to be there at 1pm but after running late at the nearby clay pigeon shoot we arrived at 2.15pm to a warm welcome. Everybody in our party commented on how good the food was and what a lovely venue. We had the room at the back of the inn which was great for us and when two people turned up unexpectantly chairs were provided for them. Quite a few of the party would have liked to have stayed longer and sample more of their fantastic selection of wines and whiskies! I would definitely return here for another special occasion.", "user": "Liz W", "date": "July 16, 2012", "id": 134506182}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "The evening meal was booked for our anniversary. The reason we chose the Nobody Inn - recommendations from others and I promise you it will not disappoint. Would have liked to stay in one of their rooms but alas being as popular as they are there was no room at the inn! We stayed at Town Barton which in itself was a treat and very close to the Nobody Inn. We were greeted at the inn by friendly staff who continued to look after us throughout the evening. The food we had was cooked to order and service was very prompt. Every course from starter to dessert was delicious and exactly as the menu described. The food was accompanied by lovely wine which we had selected from a very comprehensive wine list and the evening was topped off with a delightful malt whisky from their range of over 240 (it has to be seen to be believed). The knowledge of the staff with regard to their drinks range is exceptional. In value for money terms I could not praise this inn highly enough. Just to make sure, we had booked in for breakfast the following morning and again they didn't disappoint, lovely welcome and all the food was freshly prepared and piping hot where appropriate. Needless to say we will be visiting again some time in the future and in the meantime we will be spreading the word to encourage family members and friends to visit if they are looking for a real treat.", "title": "What a fantastic evening.", "user": "Kevan D", "date": "July 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 134419144}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Excellent food, service and selection of wines and whiskeys. staff extremely helpful and friendly.

Stepping through the door was like going back in time with none of the modern false made to look old bars like a lot of pub chains do these days this place is very very original and the welcome from the lady behind the bar made me proud to be from Devon myself. The bar has all of its original features with low beamed ceilings stained glass windows inglenook fireplace lovely old furniture and the most amazing stocked whisky (over 200) and wine ( over100) Bar with a good selection of ales. You must try a bowl of their roasted Broad Beans as a snack delicious. We both Shared a very nice ploughmans for our lunch which was served on a piece of slate very different. After a couple of drinks we were shown our room which was very clean low ceilings and laid out to a very high standard. There was even a caraff of sherry on the side which was excellant. The onsuite was modern with a good shower cubicle and good toiletries. when settled in we went for a walk to the church and could see why Cromwells men couldn't find it well worth a visit. We had our evening meal in the restaurant which was great nice setting/service and excellant food then into the bar to sample a few whiskys the knowledge of the barman regarding whisky was very good for someone so young. The bed was very comfortable which gave us a good nights sleep and breakfast in the morning was excellant.
