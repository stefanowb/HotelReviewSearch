We usually stay at the LQ but decided to try Baymont because of crazy cheap rate - big mistake. The room had a funny smell, the bedding was terrible - gross bedspread that looked 15 years old, sheets too small and kept coming off, and the bathroom was gross. Again, I'm all about budget hotels but this one was just beyond my comfort level.
