From the scent of the front foyer to the Apavita products in the bathroom. The room we had was small but we can't complain because the location said it all. The outstanding merit for both his freshly made eggs to order and his local knowledge goes to morning chef Alexandros. Thanks heaps, everything worked well. Also Katerina, your morning smile said it all. Tips for Kolonaki: 1: wake up and climb Lycavitos Hill early in the morning and have the place to yourself - the view is insane. 2: Get yourself a magnificent designer treat from Sweet Alchemy down the road from the hotel by famous Greek pastry chef Stelios Parliaros.

I did feel a little cramped throughout our original four night stay. The fact that there is no real lobby or sitting area other than the restaurant added to that. When we came back to Athens for our final night's stay our request for a larger room was met and it made a huge difference in the ambience.
