It is in the old city and within walking distance of everything in the old city. It is easy to get to from the airport by the airport bus (you will need to get a taxi from where the bus stops but that will cost very little). If you arrive late at night I recommend using the hostel's pick-up service. The guest house is very clean (cleaned daily) and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. There is free wifi and internet which works well throughout the guesthouse. The price is very reasonable and the breakfast is adequate, free tea/coffee and water are available all day. The tours to Ha Long Bay are professional and reasonably priced (a two day trip can be had from $45 US). The staff will book train tickets for you at no commission. Above all though, the staff are what make the guesthouse such a fantastic place. The staff are extremely attentive, they manage to remember everyone's name and will give you every tip they can about how to get by in Hanoi. At meal times, if you are lucky, they will share their food with you (great food) and if there is any spare food left over let you have it for snacks throughout the day. We loved Miss Chou and the rest of the girls, they are the nicest people we have met in any accommodation in nearly five years of traveling. I would stay here again without hesitation.", "title": "Brilliant - great place, exceptional staff", "user": "luketreborjones", "date": "December 11, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 89559983}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We arrived in Hanoi weary and tired after a morning flight and were enthusiastically greeted when we arrived at the Hanoi Guesthouse.
