The staff was very helpful and curtious upon arrival, and made sure we were settled in comfortably. The concierge services were also really helpful in finding actitives and recommendations of things to do during our stay. One of my favorited parts of the hotel is the rooftop pool/bar. Before arriving, I was worried it would be very crowded during the weekend, but it was the complete opposite. We had no problem getting chairs (really comfortable!) facing the ocean, and enjoying the pool which was never crowded. The rooftop had a very relaxing environment, with people enjoying drinks or cooling off in the pool. This was a great altervative from the more crowded (but still fun) beach if you wanted to relax a little before or after going out (the chairs that come with the room reservation at the beach were also a nice perk!). The location of the this hotel is also amazing - right across from the beach, 1 block away from ocean drive, close to high end shopping and restaurants, it had everything! It was also really easy to access taxi or shuttle transportation to the airport (we flew out of Ft. Lauderdale so we used GoShuttle).

When I checked in, I got a room that was so small, I could barely move. The window was frosted so you couldn't even see outside - for good reason, since the view was so ugly. But, worst of all, the quality of construction in this building is equivalent to what one would expect to find in a low-end entry-level strip mall condominium complex. The walls are paper thin and every sound from adjacent rooms and the hallway can be heard (in fact, is echoed). The noise was so loud from the guest above that I had to request another room. I got another room that was a little bigger, actually had real windows (the kind you can see through), but was still incredibly noisy. I could hear noise from adjacent rooms on both sides, the hallway, and above. But, worst of all, the speakers in the lobby that are constantly blasting fake thumping nightclub music were right below this unit, and all day long, I couldn't think, due to \"thump, thump, thump ...\" of the bass. And they never played anything that didn't thump. The staff were incredibly nice and when I complained they turned it down low enough so that I could no longer hear it, but they kept turning it up, so I had to keep asking over and over and over again. The walls are cheap stucco drywall from the 70's - the kind where they spray white stuff on drywall then squish it into flat surfaces on the wall. The carpets were worn and dirty in the entire hotel, not just the room. The elevator was always broken. I'd be inclined to give this place 2 stars but I am giving them an extra star for the staff. The staff at this hotel was truly among the best anywhere. Incredibly attentive and friendly and caring. And, the location was great - near food, shopping, and beach.", "title": "Vastly Overrated", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mitchmu", "date": "May 14, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 29948357}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Perfect location!
