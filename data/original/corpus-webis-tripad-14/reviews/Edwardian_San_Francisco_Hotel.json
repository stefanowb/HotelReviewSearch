The rooms are tidy and well-maintained; we were pleasantly surprised by the size of our en-suite bathroom. The hotel is on Market Street, close to several fun bars and restaurants and within walking distance of Mission Street, Haight-Ashbury, and the BART. There was some street noise on weekday mornings, so bring earplugs if you like to sleep late. My only real complaint is that our bed was not terribly comfortable.

The web page has incorrect pricing and location. This really should be changed promptly. I spent about 20 minutes driving around looking for public or street parking and could not find anything. Finally I called the hotel and was told where the public parking lot was located. The cost was $8.00 for overnight (until 6am) and $12 for 6am to 6pm. I planned on leaving about 7:30 the next morning and did not want to pay $12 for another hour and a half. Luckily the lot attendant was still there and told me there would be no problem staying until 7:30. The charge was only $8.00. Considering one of my co-workers stayed at another property and the parking charge was $40 for the 13 hours he was there, I felt I got a great deal! The public parking lot was less than 2 blocks away (not long blocks but if toting a lot of luggage this could be an issue - no place on the street to pull over while you check in and drop off luggage).", "user": "qbill", "date": "July 21, 2007", "id": 8212306}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved the Edwardian", "text": "Check in was quick and the manager was very friendly.

He indicated there were 2 rooms on each floor that shared a bath, but the remaining 40 (I think this was the number he said) rooms all had private baths.

The stairs leading up to the first floor was de-carpeted and filled with vagabond nails and carpet spikes, the construction workers were in and out of the building when we were there, we even had to hold the door open for some of them. the whole place REEKED! We figured that it wouldn't be half bad given the price was nearing 200 dollars usd, The whole place was under renovations and it reeked of paint thinner and mold. The counter kid didn't give two craps about his job and called his manager when we refused to stay in the teeny room with the brick wall view that we unfortunately booked. The kid was told to offer us an 'upgrade' to the fourth floor. You got there via deathtrap elevator and once on the fourth floor the reek of paint thinner and mold was near unbearable. Being six months pregnant, I fear that if we stayed there any longer I would have gone through a spontaneous miscarriage. We paid and never stayed. Their policy is a cancellation fee of a full one nights stay, EVEN if it's unsafe for us to stay.
