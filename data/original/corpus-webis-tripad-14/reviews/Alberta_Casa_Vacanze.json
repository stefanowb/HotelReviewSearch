This place was our favorite place ever in Italy! Located on the water in the perfect sized town, we hated to leave it. Let me tell you about this part of the trip - Our 6 hour train ride from France turned into a 17 hour exhausting day thanks for the Friday-make-their-weekend-longer train strike. Alberta is a private apartment so we had to meet Giacomo to acutally get into the flat. Cell phone reception is spotty because of the remoteness of the towns, but text messaging worked well. We finally arrived at 11 pm - having lost an entire day in the cinque terre. However, Alberta Casa Vacanze cheered us up with its beautiful rooms, outstanding views and location,and overall amenties. This flat is 3 stories tall, with a kitchen/eating area and laundry on the first; TV (not used), beds, bath on the 2nd level and the 3rd level is the master suite. The stairwell is a spiral staircase. Each floor had a balcony overlooking the sea. It was clean, roomy, and newly renovated. The only thing we longed for was a fan or air conditioning. At night, there wasn't any air moving and it was hot! (We knew July was a hot time to travel). Putting together the atmosphere of the town, the water, and the charm of this apartment, it became our favorite. In my photos you can see the flat (terracotta colored/green shutters) and some of the features.

The location is incredible and provides an excellent launching point to visit all five of the towns. The mgr (Giacomo) was wonderful! We called him when he changed trains in La Spezia and he gave us easy directions on how to get to the house. Met us at the door and was incredibly helpful & friendly. The house was perfect for our family of four (2 adults & 2 older children). Rooms were very clean, especially the bathroom & kitchen area. Beds were very comfortable. Did I mention the views?! The 2nd & 3rd floor rooms have balconies with chairs overlooking the small \"harbor\". The sound of waves certainly made for a peaceful sleep. Several very nice restaurants in Manarola. Will review those separately. Food prices were very affordable. There is also a nice grocery store along the main street of town that opens at 0800 where you can purchase needed items should you want to eat in the room. We are already thinking about our return trip to Manarola and Cinque Terre and we most definitely will adjust our dates in order to stay at ALBERTA Casa Vacanze once again.
