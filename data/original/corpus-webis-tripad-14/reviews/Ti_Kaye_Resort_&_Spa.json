All we wanted for the first few days of our honeymoon was sun, sand, relaxation and privacy. This resort was more than perfect for all those. We went during the \"shoulder season\" and felt like we had the place to ourselves. The staff remembered our names and were very friendly. We didn't have any bug problems (but I did douse the cottage with Skin So Soft when we arrived). For context: understand that I am from Florida, where the pace is a little slower, and grew up at beaches and pools. I also love trying exotic foods. I have been snorkeling in Key Largo and hiking in Hawaii. If you want a mini-version of these experiences (meaning that the mountains and reefs are smaller and less of them, but you also don't have to go very far to enjoy them here), you could stay for at least a week here and totally disconnect from the Blackberry addictions. And you can't beat the price. I loved every meal the chef prepared. Just keep in mind this is not a \"swim up bar\" kind of experience -- it's way more personal, way more intimate and you get more of the feel of the people of St. Lucia. LOVED the private plunge pool and garden shower and create-your-own mini bar. Plus the manager is a wonderful hostess. Our \"love\" cottage was bigger than my apartment. Every feature from the four poster, mosquito net canopy bed, to the hammock on the front porch over looking the ocean was a temptation to never leave the room. BTW - other resorts ship their snorkelers into this same beach so you might want to get your dip in before/after they leave, which is usually around 10 am and 2 pm. Try really hard to do nothing and enjoy it! If you must do activities other than snorkeling and lounging, do the wine tasting, and ask about local hiking trips.
