The location is perfect..only about a block or two off Times Square. The hotel does have an adjacent restaurant and bar but has lots of options right across 8th Avenue, including a Mexican, Chinese and Greek restaurant as well as a Starbucks and pizza place.

Times Square is a few blocks away and there are many subway lines within a block or two of the hotel. Everything you need is at your disposal. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and service oriented. Charles the Bell Man was outstanding. He amused my 10 year old daughter on a daily basis and added a bright spot each morning as we headed out for an adventure. As a Diamond member with Hilton, we received complimentary breakfast each morning. What made this special and unique was that the breakfast was served at Pigalle Restaurant which is connected to the hotel. What a nice treat to have something different than the standard Hilton Garden buffet. There were about 6 items to chose from for the free breakfast and all were excellent. Since we were there for 8 days, we made our way through the menu. I can honestly say that there really wasn't much to criticize at the hotel. I think the only drawback is that the rooms are on the small side. This was another motel that was renovated by Hilton, so there isn't much you can do with the rooms as far as size goes. There were two adult women and one child in the room and we did fine. You just need to plan your bathroom/showers accordingly to avoid confusion and congestion. Also, we had some family join us for two nights and they stayed on the third floor. Evidently, the subway was quite noisy and very noticeable on that floor.

We got to see the statue of liberty up close and all the bridges. It was fantastic and was operated by circle line 42. I would suggest arriving 45 min early to secure a space in line.
