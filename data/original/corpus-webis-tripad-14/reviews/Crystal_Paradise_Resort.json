It isn't a resort and that was exactly what we wanted. A peaceful getaway far out of town. The dining area and lounging deck just lovely and relaxing. It is aso nice because you eat family style with your fellow travelers. I thought it was a good deal since they took us all the way to and from Belize City and also included all food except lunch. Jeroni and Eric, two of the family hosts can pick out any bird from a mile away and Jeroni took us birding one morning and picked out every bird in sight. They have parrots that come to their orange trees every morning and evening. We took a tour from there to Tikal. I also thought this was a good deal because they took us all the way to the Guatemalan border, carefully handing off to the driver on the other side so we were always being watched over and felt comfortable. I don't know anywhere on earth that you could get two hours each way to somewhere, a driver and a guide, lunch and entrance to a wonder of the world for $200 ($100 pp). The only thing I wish we had done was ask specifically about the tour because the guide nearly killed us running us around. We were with four other people who joined us from another resort once we were there so we had no choice but to keep up. We would gladly have paid for our own guide so we could have set our own pace. It didn't occur to me to ask in advance so I wish the Crystal Paradise had asked us what kind of tour we wanted. The food was the best we had in our eight days in Belize.
