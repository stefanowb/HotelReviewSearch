We were looking for a place that was family friendly and close to Story land and the Old Field House was recommended to us. We were able to book one of the townhouses behind the main building with only a few days notice. The price was about middle of the road for what we were looking at and the townhouse was extremely spacious. it was listed as a two bedroom but could easily have slept more people with a daybed in a nook at the top of the stairs, a massive master bedroom closet where you could easily put a crib or a couple of sleeping bags and couches in the main room. It also had a bath and 1/2, a full kitchen, a dining table for 8 and very large living room. Everything was very clean and well maintained, well stocked with towels, extra pillows and blankets. There was also a selection of games and books in the main room, perfect for a rainy day. There was a fireplace available but you are expected to supply your own wood. There was a bit of confusion on check-in. The website and sign out front said breakfast was included in the price but on check-in we were told that the townhouses were not included in the breakfast plan, only the main building. But when we protested the manager quickly said to just come on up. And breakfast was good, their specialty is belgian waffles with all the fixings but they also had eggs, toasts, oatmeal, sweet breads and cereal.

Washington Valley offers plenty to do. The inn is centrally located within the valley and so a good hub for all the recreation options from hiking and skiing to shopping. Never been dissapointed and as a veteran shopper of vacation lodging, I would definitely say that the Old Field House is a terrific value. Inn rooms are clean, comfortable, with all standard ammenities, cable TV, phone. One caveat - some of the rooms tend to be small , but they do offer the option of adjoining rooms and family suites for parents plus kids. One of the best features is the extra space for hanging out in the lower level, i.e., game room for kids with ping pong etc and adjacent den with TV, books, scrabble and other board games. The ground level has a sunny dining area for breakfast as well as another very pleasant sitting room with gas fireplace. During nice weather, there are a couple of hammocks on a shaded lawn. All these places and spaces within the building and grounds give multiple options for hanging out other than the usual confine of a hotel room. Also on the grounds is a basketball hoop, spacious lawns for the kids to run around, swim pool and jacuzzi. If your group is larger, there is yet another option - 2-3 bedroom townhomes. These condos have it all including laundry, but best is that they can be rented on a nightly basis, I think with 2 nite min. Often when I'm looking for condo rentals, it's weekly only. The Innkeepers, Rod and Linea could not be nicer - attentive, helpful and resourceful . We'll be back.
