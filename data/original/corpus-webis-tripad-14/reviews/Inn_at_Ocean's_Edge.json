Why? It is not an Inn. It is an upscale motel. There are two buildings several hundred feet apart that contain rooms. The dining is another long distance away down in the woods. We were really hoping for a nice relaxing experience in an oceanfront Inn. Unfortunately it was not to be. The place is horrible in the rain. We got soaked trying to get to the dining room as there is no parking anywhere near it. The property and rooms are very nice, but again, it is not an Inn as advertised. Between dining and the room we spent nearly $500.00 per night. It simply wasn't worth it. We ended up not staying as long as we hoped. If you want a nice motel, this is your place. If you want a true Maine Country Inn, there are much nicer choices in the area. Also, the \"Inn\" is rated a Four Diamond Property. Again, the rooms were nice , but the service was a disaster. Not the Four Diamond level of service we expected.", "title": "Nice Motel...Not an Inn", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Careyr", "date": "July 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 5494640}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006", "text": "We returned for our second visit to the inn and many fabulous changes had taken place including a magnificent endless edge heated pool and spa.

Our room was decorated Laura Ashley style with a jaccuzzi and a fireplace. It was large, spacious and had a beautioful view of the water and trees. Mary Ann, trhe innkeeper, was gracious, extremely attentive, and a wonderful cook. She, her husband, and Heather made us feel very much at home. The inn is off the main highway, so it is quiet, unlike many of the establishments on the main road. It has all of the amenities you can think of, including a pool, workout room, and fine dining restaurant. Since we were there in June, it was not crowded, and our every whim was catered to with gusto. This is the finest inn we have ever stayed in, and we can't recommend it too highly.
