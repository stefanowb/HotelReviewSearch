The staff was among the friendliest and most accommodating I've encountered anywhere. The WiFi signal was adequate for business purposes in the meeting space. In my room on the third floor, I was able to stream true HD-quality video from the U.S. (I was watching NHL hockey)--in other words, better than most hotels. My room was quite spacious, larger than is typical even in the U.S. and much larger than most European hotels. The dining room is ornate and the breakfast, included with the room, was very good with a fair range of food choices that included both cold and hot items. Lunch is served from a full menu and was excellent in quality. I did not have a dinner there.", "title": "By no means 4-star hotel!", "user": "G_Bebetsos", "date": "October 9, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 142406280}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011", "text": "This is a fair stay for one night. The steps up to the lobby from the parking lot make it hard for heavy luggage (and the very steep rolling pad helps but only just a little). The lobby area is pretty cramped, but check in was fast. The room was comfortable, staff VERY courteous and helpful. Internet on the 2nd floor was impossible - I had to go down to the lobby to get a wireless signal. The split air conditioning unit was quiet and effective. The bathroom shower apparatus was confusing (as I found elsewhere in Serbia) and didn't respond the way I intuitively thought it would. The restaurant's offerings, both for breakfast and dinner were delightful. The lane approaching the hotel from the street is pretty narrow, and all it took was for one bozo to park his/her Mercedes in the wrong spot to hem in my van for a long time (it took a resident from an adjoining apartment complex to move her car, legitimately parked, to allow us to leave).

The faraway known fortress of Nis is just a couple of minutes walk away from our hotel. Near from here, our guests can also visit the National Theater and Saborna (central) church. They can do a relaxation walk by the beautiful quay of river. The main pedestrian zone, where the club itself is found, enables one to enjoy many cafeterias and boutiques. Just around the corner, one can find the largest shopping center and two well-stocked supermarkets. The central bus station is also near, which makes the club the best option to enjoy the city in a charming way."}
