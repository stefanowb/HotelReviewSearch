We had never been before and wanted to go somewhere \"tropical\" without leaving the country. We had an \"ok\" time. Let me start by saying we are not hard to please...but found that the area was very overpriced and a bit run down. We stayed at the Sheraton Suites. The room was nice and big, updated inside however on the outside the hotel was lacking. Seemed a bit rundown. The pool area was a lot smaller than it seemed in the hotel photos online. The hot tub was broke for about three out of our five day trip. Best thing was the conceriege. She was great! Was very knowledgeable about all the excursions. Across from the hotel was a public beach....beware it is 30.00 for two chaises and a umbrella. Sandy area is small and no waves, however beach was quiet and relaxing, we enjoyed it. We did the Ultimate Adventure boating, which included snorkling, jet skiing, water trampoling, parasailing. It costs around 600.00 for a family of five and included breakfast and lunch. At reservations they were not very organized and we were sent to 2 different locations before we could check in for our trip. They couldn't find our reservation, so they had to re enter it which took a while. Even though I had a receipt which included a deposit. Duval street is probably great if you are there to party but with three kids in tow we didn't get much out of it. We ate at The Grande @ Key West which was very upscale but the staff seemed very snobby. Cheesburgers in Paradise was horrible, don't bother wasting your money, There was also a seafood buffett that we ate at on Duval not great. We did eat at one Italian restaurant of off Duval which was great! Best meal while we were their. All in all, I don't think Key West is geared towards families more for singles, couples.
