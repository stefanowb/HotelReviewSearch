We choose this hotel because my mother in law who lives in Kendall needed to get radiation treatment for her brain cancer and it is very close to her house and hospital. We decided to make it a mini vacation for our family. I stayed at the hotel everyday with the kids while my husband went to treatment with his mother. The location of this hotel is great! Walking distance to great resturants, movie theater and Barnes and Noble. We didn't even cross 88th Street (very busy street almost like a highway)", "title": "Best Western is the Best!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Irelandred", "date": "August 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8502680, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Spotless, location", "disliked": "\u2014 no view"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is great and the people that work here are as well.

The breakfast daily was excellent and the woman that took care of it never let any food run out. She always was very pleasant! This hotel is spotless. Everyone that works here takes a lot of pride in their job and they all seem to be very happy!! When employees are happy it really shows!!!

The location was great and easy to find from the Miami Airport. I was there on business for my company. I use the internet over 9 hours a day. This hotel has a fanastic internet cafe which was very helpful while my laptop was recharging. There are so many different resturants in walking distance, you would have to stay a week to eat at all of them. I will be staying at this hotel again when I am in Miami/Kendall area.
