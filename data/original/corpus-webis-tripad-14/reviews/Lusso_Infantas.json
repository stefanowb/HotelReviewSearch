Warm, friendly, Tapas! and plenty to see. Our Hotel was pretty central ... all the sights within a 15-20 minute walking radius. 2 couples - 2 rooms - both very big and comfortable - lovely novel window shutters. About eur 170 per night per couple including a breakfast (good variety of food choices). Staff were very friendly. So, why the 'But' ....... well our rooms were on the corner of the hotel - and well on Friday & Saturday night it was pretty noisy ... and you couldn't keep the noise out! There is a gathering area about 50 metres from the hotel ... and boy did they gather (50-100) .... and talked ... and shouted ... drinking sure - clealy evident, but not creating any trouble or making you feel intimidated in real way ... but noisy - many adjoining streets have nightlife on them. I had quite a few beers each night & am not a light sleeper, but i woke 4 to 5 times each nightwith the surges of noise - the latest was 5am - i looked out the local police were carting a trouble-maker away.

The bed is not so comfortable as in the typical chain hotels, but it is ok. The streets are a bit noisy, but you do not hear it so much... The only problem I see is that the facilities are getting older over time and there is no sign of keeping them up to date. These are little details, but over time they may be my reason to change to other hotel. It is a pity, but it seems to be the way things work in Spain.
