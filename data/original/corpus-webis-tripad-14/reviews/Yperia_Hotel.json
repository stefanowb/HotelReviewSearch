The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern. Our only small complaint are the beds that are somewhat small if you\u00b4re a tall person. We used the pool almost every day, a great spot for reading after a day at one of the beaches. The location is great in the centre of Aegali, which we also found was our favourite village of the island. There's a number of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel, ask Antonis for advice.
