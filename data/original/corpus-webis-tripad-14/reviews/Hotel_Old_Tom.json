It was my second visit, having been there in 1995 for two nights as well. Absolutely no complaints! As others have noted, the rooms are relatively small but adequate, with comfortable beds to stretch out on after long days touring the Ypres salient. The restaurant cuisine was the best value we experienced in a months stay in Holland, Belgium and France; the meals being delicious, generous of proportion and very reasonably priced compared to the rest of Northern Europe. I have a good appetite and I could just barely finish a magnificent ragout one evening. The staff were courteous and friendly. Safe overnight parking is available at no cost in the town square right across the street. Everything of interest within the town of Ypres is within walking distance of the hotel. I will be returning to this fascinating area and I hope to enjoy the comforts of the Old Tom once again.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "RicTerrace_BCCanada", "date": "July 29, 2005", "id": 3718889}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2005", "text": "We have just returned to england after a very pleasant stay at The Old Tom.

There's no lift, so getting to our room on the third floor provided plenty of exercise - not ideal for some. The bathroom was small but spotless and seemed to have been renovated recently. The room decor was a little 'tired' - but maybe they'll be updating these next. Breakfast was fine and we ate dinner here too - good portions.
