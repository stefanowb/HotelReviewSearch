The food in their restaurant was consistently delicious and satisfying. Deetjen's service was excellent! They have a nicely chosen wine list with reasonable prices. Besides looking forward to the meals we loved our accommodations. It wasn't fancy but it was comfortable and unique. Our room, The Faraway Room, had it's own wood burning fireplace and enough space to sit around, read and relax. We felt \"faraway\" from the busy life of a city. The rooms are like little cabins nestled in a small canyon with ample parking and easy access. Deetjens is located just a few miles from several state parks and a couple of much fancier resorts. Those are fun to visit to compare and to take in their view(s) of the foothills and ocean. Those places are hundreds to over a thousand dollars more per night and aren't that much different than other resorts in that category. Deetjens and The Big Sur Inn is totally a one of a kind experience. The locals seemed to go there for breakfast or to meet for a glass of wine in the evening. It feels like a bit of history is being preserved and it's not about to change. We also laughed at the comments written in the journals/diaries left for that purpose in our room. Every room has eight to ten diaries going back about ten years. Guests may write about their experience and they vary from being philosophical to \"naughty\". I highly recommend staying here if you're willing to look for perfection in imperfection. It was a wonderful stay and we look forward to staying again.", "title": "Deetjens was wonderful!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "topazhorse", "date": "January 3, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 52470277}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2009", "text": "Deetjen Big Sur Inn is in a beautiful place and has an award wining restaurant which we enjoyed very much. However, if you stay there during the winter, understand that all the attention to detail in the restaurant is not true for the lodging which is just a step above camping. Also, there is limited service in case of a problem. Our heater did not work for two days in 40 degree temp and it was hard to get help to fix it. In addition, there was a mouse living in my room. There was no one on duty to discuss an adjustment in my rates and, after returning home, I called. The best they would do was a $150 credit for my next visit - frankly, with this treatment, I would decline going again to anything but the restaurant.

The first room was the \"honeymoon\" room - it had a beautiful private garden patio and a wood-burning stove inside. It was beautiful and extremely romantic. The second room we stayed in was a walk away from the main inn, under the redwoods - I think it was called \"faraway.\" This room wasn't quite as gorgeous, but had a lovely porch under the trees and was right near a stream that we could hear from our bedroom. Both rooms were beautiful in very different, rustic ways - we really liked the antique feel of the whole place. We also loved the restaurant - it was so romantic in the evening, the dinner was delicious, and the brunch was incredible. I thought that Deetjen's added a level of magic and romance to our few days in Big Sur that we would never have found in one of the more modern hotels in the area. I would recommend this inn to anyone who like things a little bit off of the beaten path - it was really an unforgettable experience.", "title": "magical experience at Deetjen's", "user": "ptw12", "date": "December 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 51906877}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Just spent a 3 day weekend (San Simeon, Big Sur & Carmel by the Sea) with a stay at Deetjens.

I don't know if the 'not for profit' sham - Oh I'm sorry I meant, not for profit status, had anything to do with it. For us, our sanity and money, I would probably stay at Treebones or just spend the day in Big Sur and go up to Carmel by the Sea (only 29 miles away). In Carmel by the Sea we stayed in a luxurious 3 room suite, with fireplace, bathtub and king bed with down comforter and feather bed topper.
