I stayed here 4 nights & had no major problems to speak of. The area isn't too exciting but Dunkin Donuts/Shell gas station was next door if you needed something other than what the hotel offered. There was nothing else within walking distance. The hotel has a decent sized indoor pool & jacuzzi open until 11 pm & plenty of parking. The lobby/breakfast area was large & welcoming with plenty of tables & a tv. They have a small sundries shop/market with water, juice, soft drinks, frozen dinners & microwave, cookies, candy, nuts & other supplies. The front desk staff was always polite & helpful & even allowed me to use their computer when the business center was full. Breakfast was fine with waffle makers, plenty of muffins & pastries, cereal, juice, coffee, hot cocoa, tea, fruit, eggs & sausage daily. It is open at 6:30 am during the week & 7 am on weekends. The lady re-stocking the breakfast area wasn't too pleasant but it wasn't a big deal. The main elevator could be a bit slow but since I was only up one floor, I would either take the stairs or the elevator at the end of the hallway. I did a complete check of the bed, bedding, headboards, pillows, mattress & box springs upon arrival to look for any unwanted pests. I didn't find any, but I also didn't have zippered covers on the springs, mattress or pillows. With bed bugs such an issue these days, I can't believe hotels don't make this mandatory! I did have one pillow with a zippered cover but I think it was to prevent the feathers from poking through (it was partly made of down). My headboard had deep gashes carved in it & appeared as though someone had tried to touch them up with a stain pen but it was poorly done needed some wood filler to look better. I did find hair on a wash cloth & a dirty tub - it had hair in it & appeared as though someone had been standing in the tub with dirty shoes. I travel with my own cleaning/sanitation supplies so I just took care of it myself. I rarely check into a hotel these days without hair in the tub somewhere (it's so gross!) The spacious room had a large desk & refrigerator. The closet rod was in an awkward place as it didn't extend the length of the closet so it made it hard to get in & out of with the sliding doors. It was fine for me but if you had more than one person hanging clothes, it would be crowded. A cab to the airport was 24.00 & I didn't use the hotel's local shuttle service. A man working the front desk one evening was overwhelmed with people checking in, people trying to buy sundries & calls - he didn't seem to be able to multi-task. I stood there for over 10 minutes & finally told him I was leaving the money for the bottled water on the desk. I would stay here again, especially if I were traveling to Salem or points north of Boston. As this was for work, I didn't pay for the stay so I can't comment on the value.", "title": "Better than expected based on reviews", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Lem1", "date": "June 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 163580925}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled solo", "text": "The hotel was ok good for an inn. So I could say that met my expectations. But if you are in Boston to travel and go around the area. I suggest find another hotel. The reason why the prices here is reasonably cheap is because. You will incur additional charges to go to Downtown. Their shuttle bus runs everyhour and does not run in between even though there are guests that needs to be sent to the train station. How bad is the customer service there. An example of a normal day to and from the hotel is this. From the hotel, they will send you to wonderland station. That is around 15min drive. Then from wonderland station it will take you 30-40 minutes to downtown. So all in all almost one hour spent to go to downtown. =(=(=(. Then going back you need to call them.
