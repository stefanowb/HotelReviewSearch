I can understand that. I was told it would be rerouted. After about 30 minutes or more I still did not have my bag. I called the Bell Hop and was told they couldn't find my bag and they hanged up on me. I had one of the Bell Captains come to my room to inquire what my bag looked like.

The room was very spacious with a partial pool view. Beautiful bath with full jacuzzi tub and separate shower and toilet. When we went to the pool in the early afternoon, could not find a single lounge chair-- all were either taken or had towels draped on them to save them. Ended up sitting on ground next to pool, and we were not the only ones who had to do that. But there were plenty of the pay-to-lay bed-size lounge beds that you have to rent. Guess management figures they'd rather rent out some of those than provide enough chairs for guests. And the regular lounge chairs are crammed side by side with no space in between. OK, next day, go to the fitness center (which I love), then mosey over to pool. Knew it was a risk to not go there first thing in the morning, but still got there around maybe 11:30 and, sure enough, there were no more chairs and we ended up sitting poolside again. Kind of ridiculous. They really need to add more chairs or subtract some of the rental beds/cabanas. Love, love, love the spa - it's so relaxing and pure escape. The slots were very tight.
