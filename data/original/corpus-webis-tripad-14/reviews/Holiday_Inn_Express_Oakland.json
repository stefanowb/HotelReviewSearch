There is a very small work-out room and also a room with a whirlpool in it that actually has a lift for wheelchair bound individuals -- very handicapped accessible, which is quite rare. We used neither of those amenities, however. We did use the complimentary shuttle service several times. They will drop off and pick up anywhere within a 3 mile radius, including the airport, restaurants, airport car rental area, etc. We used it to go to and from the BART station (where we caught a train in to SF) and also at 4:30 a.m. to get to the airport. This is not a vacationer's hotel, but a business traveler's layover(as Holiday Inn Express is supposed to be). It was quiet, nice, convenient, but plain -- which was perfect for our situation.

I was intrigued and looked forward to staying. I liked the hotel just fine. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. It is larger than better rated more expensive hotels. The bed is comfortable, nice large flat screen tv in the room, complimentary wireless internet access, refrigerator and microwave in the room. They have a fitness center, business center, airport shuttle, and offer complimentary continental breakfast, neither of which I tried. My main problem with this hotel was the lack of a restaurant, gift shop and room service which other hotels that have similar star ratings do have. My girlfriend and I stayed over Thanksgiving and just about everything, including gas station stores were either closed or did not have much to choose from. Although there are other hotels, bars, supermarkets nearby, it is not really an area to walk around in. Had I foreseen this, I would have spent the night elsewhere. If you have an early flight, the location is great since it is just a few minutes' drive, but if not flying out, perhaps something in downtown Oakland, Berkeley or Emeryville would be a better option. The front desk was a bit understaffed and when I called, the person was talking to someone else while trying to help me, then put me on hold for a long time and I finally had to come down to the desk personally. They offer in-room movies, but I find their system unusual and a little more complicated than most. I would rather just be able to order with the remote like other hotels. Amazingly, I did not hear any airplane noise that would keep me up.
