Checked in on Sunday morning and room was made available within an hour. Even received an upgrade to a Harbourview room on the 26th floor, which is one of their \"BIZ\" floors. Room was rather small, but it did not cause a problem, as I was travelling on my own. The location of the hotel is ok, although not exceptional, as you have to take a taxi, which I did a couple of times, to get to the Star Ferry & Central. These are very cheap and set you back two pounds each way, which equals HKD 30. I would not recommend breakfast, as it is not value for money at all. Rather have a little business breakfast in their business centre, which is located on 1st floor, which is charged at HKD 28 rather than the 128 they charge you in the restaurant. Another recommendation for improvement would be the servicing of the room, which never happened before late afternoon. All in all a good experience especially when considering the small amount of HKD 460/night paid (booked via their website).
