I mean, if you were spending one night for a meeting in Montreal and your flights meant that you had to check in before 4pm and leave after noon, that's $50 extra right there, just for absolutely standard services that every other hotel (even the Holiday Inn Express brand in the same chain) is happy to offer for free! If a room is not ready for early check-in, that's perfectly understandable; but how is it fair to say your room is ready but if you don't wait around until 4pm, you have to pay extra?
