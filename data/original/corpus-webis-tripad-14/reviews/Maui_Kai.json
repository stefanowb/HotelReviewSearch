Loved the mornings watching whales from our balcony. One whale did a full breach right in front of us - awesome. We had a wonderful 12 days in unit #406 - did lots of relaxing, laying in the sun, swimming, snorkeling. Best vacation ever. We'll definitely be back to Maui Kai. If you want a big resort with fancy dining & lots to do - this probably isn't the place. But Maui Kai is friendly, quiet; parking is close; no condo is more than about a 10 second walk from the elevator; ocean view from EVERY unit; swimming & snorkeling 5-10 steps from the patio; convenient to Lahaina & Ka'anapali shopping", "helpfulness": 18, "user": "hotairflyn", "date": "February 28, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3234619}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Maui Kai 301", "text": "Our favorite places to eat - Bubba Gumps & Alexander's Fish & Chips - both in Lahaina.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 24, 2005", "id": 3225754}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "MauiKai-504 The ultimite spot", "text": "Don't miss the trip up Haleakala - one of my favorite places on earth.
