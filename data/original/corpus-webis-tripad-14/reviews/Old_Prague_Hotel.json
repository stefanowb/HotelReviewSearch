Personally, I think it reminds me of a larger version of Venice but I think it's more beatiful. Anyway, the hotel location can't be beat. 7 minutes walk to Charles Bridde. 5 Minute walk to Old Town. My only complaint about the hotel is the street noise at night. We were there for 3 nights and each and every night, there were car alarms, car honking and general screaming from partying folks. Maybe it's better on the non-street side...but I doubt it. We were on the 4th floor. The elevator is really, really tiny and can fit myself and 2 bags. That's it. I usually walked up the stairs (102 steps) for the exercise. Normally, I don't care about noise as I consider it part of sleeping in the city. But, it was SOOO LOUD. I think the noise was due to the strip club near the hotel. but not sure.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "pechung", "date": "May 3, 2007", "id": 7543234}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "We had a room with 2 beds (3 actually).
