Each bedroom however, had a problem - lack of heating in the bathroom of one (King Lear) and a scaldingly hot shower (we were unable to get any cold water through) in the other(Merchant of Venice). On reporting these to the management the response was \"the last guests didn't complain\". A small portable heater was provided for the one room but the. problem was not rectified or explained in the other.. The manager and his wife( we understand they have only taken over in the last month) seemed totally indifferent to the needs of their guests as was exemplified when there was a power cut on the last evening. No conversation, let alone explanation was forthcoming, until two small tealights on a saucer were thrust into our hands and we were left to cope with getting to our rooms, without a word of concern or apology.
