Breakfast and service is fine. It is advertised as a boutique hotel, but the dated and somewhat cluttered decor stretches this description. Think 'changing rooms 2003' to get an idea of the style. Paint effect walls and fancy drapes, together with 10(!!!) animal print cushions in the room, are intended to hint at safari. Public areas are paint effect panelling and dado. Now looking tired. Restaurant was not open when we were there in August. Nothing to this effect on the web site. Never saw our host Neil. Apparently he had moved on to another project. The young lady on reception was lovely and so helpful, but it had the feel of hotel rather than guest house. There was nothing personal about the service. We were given a map and major landmarks and restaurants pointed out to us.", "title": "Dated decor", "user": "whalewatcherSussex", "date": "September 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8614745, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 central location", "disliked": "\u2014 tepid shower water in the morning.
