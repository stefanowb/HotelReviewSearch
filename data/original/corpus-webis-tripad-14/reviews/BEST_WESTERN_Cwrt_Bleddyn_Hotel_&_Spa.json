There was also a wedding one night I stayed - but was pleasantly surprised that I heard no noise from this at all. Used the lovely good sized pool and Jacuzzi. Staff very pleasant and helpful - complimentary towels available. Pool and Jacuzzi temperature just lovely. I found the dimmed lighting in the pool area very relaxing after a day out walking. The breakfast was good - cooked to order and a good choice too. Breakfast staff were very pleasant and helpful as well. Bar area looked comfortable - but didn't use it. Would just say the corridor areas could do with a lick of paint and the courtyard area needs checking perhaps more regularly for used items and cigarette butts.

The split-level bathroom was very old-fashioned and stylish, again with sloping ceilings and a beautiful washstand. I've never loved a hotel room as much as the one here...For another reviewer to complain about creaking floorboards: it's hundreds of years old; what would you expect?!! We had a deal for dinner to be incuded in our stay.The menu was extensive, with several choices, and an unusually high vegetarian selection for myself. Our lovely server Kate was extremely knowledgeable and efficient, and they are very accommodating about specific diertary requirements. The spa and pool facilities were extremely good. The large pool was a little warmer than is usual, which suited me immeasurably!
