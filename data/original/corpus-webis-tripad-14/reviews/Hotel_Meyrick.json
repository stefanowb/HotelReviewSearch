There is a lovely atmosphere the minute your walk into the foyer with a lovely fire and comfortable seating where you could just sit and watch the world go by while listening to the wonderful live pianist. The room was lovley while a little old fashioned but clean and spotless. We found the staff most helpful. However, there is one aspect of this hotel which completely lets it down and that is the gym - it is supposed to be \"state of the art\" but this is far from reality - the machines are really old and one of the treadmills was broken for the whole time we were there. There is no ventiliation at all apart from two delapated fans, one of which came apart in my hand, but the worst thing is that the gym is dirty. There is nothing to clean the machines down after you use them - there was a spray in the corner of the room but no paper towels to be used with them - I asked for some and was given a few but when I went back the following day, there were no paper towels again or the other days I was there. There are cobwebs and dust everywhere and the place looks like it has not received a good cleaning in years - the shower area is the same - the area is old and grotty but nothing that a bit of elbow grease won't shift - such a pity as the views from the gym area extend all over the city and with just a little effort this area could easily be brought right up to scratch.", "title": "Great Location - gym very disappointing", "user": "Izzie W", "date": "February 24, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 152981965}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "Since the last time I stayed here a few years ago the Meyrick has seriously upped its game!

I'd highly recommend this hotel for many reasons - its excellent location, very friendly and helpful staff and its stylish and comfortable rooms. The location is unbeatable and the valet parking makes for a very relaxed city break. We were able to walk everywhere, you cant get closer to the shops and nightlife. We both used the spa and enjoyed lovely massages as well as the outdoor hot tub which is super. Breakfast was very good with lots of variety and the staff throughout the hotel were very attentive.
