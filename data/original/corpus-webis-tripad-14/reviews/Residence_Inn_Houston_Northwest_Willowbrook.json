The beds were a bit firm for my preference, but that truly is my only negative comment and it really is a personal preference. The pool and pool area were excellent...the kids loved the indoor pool.We spend hours in there! And dried off outside by the fireplace on the patio. We love having a full kitchen even though we did not use it to the fullest potential, but having the cabinet space is GREAT with a family! Breakfast buffet is amazing! Never had so many choices for breakfast and the Texas shaped waffles were a hoot for the kids! The hot items changed each morning we were there, so plenty of options. The locaion is amazing being so close to the mall, shopping, restaurants, entertainment and the area felt secure. The staff was super friendly, very accomodating no matter the circumstances or request.", "title": "Excellent location, excellent staff, excellent ammenities", "user": "Julie C", "date": "June 26, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 132856078}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed two nights in a one bedroom suite.

Also there is an outdoor gas grill that is huge. We cooked steaks, chicken, and hamburgers on two separate days. The pool was average size and clean. On Mondays thru Wednesday there is a evening meal provided by the hotel. My only complaint would be the basketball court that is not gated and therefore know key card is needed. On Sunday evening there were about 4 hooligans playing ball that were obviously not guests of the hotel. How about just removing the basketball goal? The hotel is located next to a good size mall.
