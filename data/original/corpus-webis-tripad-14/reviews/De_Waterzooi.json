The city itself is beautiful but much less of a tourist trap than Bruges. De Waterzooi is central, with the number 1 tram stop outside. It is a short walk to everything of interest, not least the vibrant Graslei where there are bars, restaurants and great views to keep anyone exceedingly happy! We stayed in the Felix suite. It is spacious, light and everything about it is even more 'home from home' than Kay hopes it will be! All the things you would expect are there and more. Not least from one window you will have a perfect view of the castle, Gravensteen, and from the bedroom terrace you see the city towers and over towards the 16th Century guildhouses along the Leie. The breakfasts set us up for the day and Kay introduced additional surprise courses to ensure we weren't peckish till dinner! We had one of those at the Graslei brasserie (very good) and another at the more upmarket Pakhuis, which was well worth the extra money. Both were spot on recommendations from Kay, who along with Christian, could not have done more to welcome us into their superbly renovated 18th Century home.", "title": "A wonderful B&B in a perfect location,superb city!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "VKJ", "date": "April 6, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127343792}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Kay and Christian are wonderful hosts who have lovingly restored and converted de Waterzooi into the most exquisite accommodation.", "title": "Surely the best ever B&B", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "LizzieN", "date": "April 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 127288270}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Tram 1 takes you straight from Gent St Pieters station and drops you in St Veerleplein, just steps from de Waterzooi.
