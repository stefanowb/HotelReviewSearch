The first is the very poor lighting in the room at night. It was almost impossible to read anything after dark. The other thing that I was disappointed in was the staff. We really did not have a complaint at all until we left and really wanted to express to them at check out how much we loved the hotel and would recommend it and be back, I paid my bill. I did not get a thank-you or how was your stay. I stood there for a second dumbfounded because I was basically dismissed by the front desk person as he turned his back and walked away before I could even begin to tell him thanks. This seemed to be pretty common in St. Augustine though, we were almost never thanked or asked by anyone how we were enjoying our stay.", "title": "JUST RIGHT!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "drake s", "date": "April 13, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4971354}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "Regardless, we will return to this hotel and we will enjoy ourselves again, even if no one cares!!!", "title": "Stayed with young child...", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "mandy t", "date": "April 11, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4957561}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Clean, Beautiful- A Must", "text": "Okay, I am a \"hotel\" snob so I went out on a limb and stayed here without ever seeing the place! To my surprise it was as nice- if not nicer- than several Marriott's I've stayed in. The rooms are clean and the shower is huge. It is a smaller hotel, very quaint and personable. The steam and sauna were great,and they have a little spa! It may not be on-on the beach but it basically is! I mean, you can't see the ocean from your window but it is very convenient to walk to. So close that I could go to and from the bathroom and it would take me no time. Stay here if you plan a trip to Saint Augustine.
