The staff was friendly and accomodating, despite a problem during check-in where I was informed that the room cost more than I reserved it for online. (I was about to be charged the regular price instead of the promo price I saw on their website, but they cleared it up when I told them that.) Confusion got worse with the room key, which is needed to power up the electricity in the room. And it continued when I realized there was no hotel binder in the room. I had to call the front desk with all my questions (ie, where's the room service menu?!), but I was always answered promptly (ie, the menu arrived at my room 2 minutes later). Nonetheless, the free wireless and local calls made up for any lack of understanding regarding the room. I would definitely stay here again.

I can without a doubt say that the Real Del Rio was safe, clean, accomadating, and excellent service! Many of the staff speak English. The Bell Boys, (Christian, Danny, and Manuel) were very helpful and took good geniune care of all of the customers. The maids were all kind and helpful. Bottled water delivered to room daily. Flat Screen TVs and Trendy New Decor. (recently remodeled) Beds were very comfortable and I had no problem getting extra pillows and blankets. Air worked so good - It was fantastic!! :) I was only a $5.00 cab ride from anything that I wanted and just a few minutes from the US. And the food was AMAZING!! Seriously, some of the best food ever!! The restuarant completely exceeded all expectations. Room service was fast and friendly. Excellent choice if you are staying in the TJ area.

The room included a flat screen tv, nice, big shower, a safe for my valuables, and it was very well kept up and clean. I ordered room service and I felt like a King staying in a castle. I highly recommend the cream chees crepes! Not to mention the general manager, Pablo, surpassed my expectations by visiting us in our room and welcoming us to the hotel. He reassured us that anything we needed, he would gladly give to us. The first night we stayed there, we received a complimentary delicious treat at our door. That put the icing on the cake for my pleasant stay. I recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to go to Tijuana.
