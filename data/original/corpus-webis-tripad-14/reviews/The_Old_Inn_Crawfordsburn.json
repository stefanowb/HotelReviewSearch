The \"Lewis\" restaurant with an open fire is a nice cosy spot for a meal and the food was first class. The main public bar looked like a great meeting place and eatery to meet friends. Very enjoyable stay, however lost my top mark due to service at breakfast which was not in keeping with its 4 star rating. As we eat each course the dishes just piled up on my table and I never got offered a refill for my coffee. The food was plentiful and of a high standard at dinner and breakfast. A great hotel for a special occasion or romantic short break..", "title": "Could do better", "user": "MLindsay", "date": "January 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 122535657}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "Really looked forward to the break as it was a birthday treat, booked a suite.

Breakfast the next morning was also very good with a selection of breads etc plus a complimentary cooked breakfast. The room itself was quaint and comfortable with a flat screen tv, however the tv only had 8 channels (but then who stays in a hotel to watch tv?) However the bad aspect of this stay (which probably isnt relevant for everyone elses stay as my bad point was linked to other people having their christmas functions there) was that after the bar had closed people who had booked rooms seemingly invited the rest of their friends up for a party. At about 2am, having had no sleep due to loud talking/singing/music from the next room I called reception. The chap on the desk was very helpful and I could hear him arguing with the people in the next room who were giving him a lot of abuse.
