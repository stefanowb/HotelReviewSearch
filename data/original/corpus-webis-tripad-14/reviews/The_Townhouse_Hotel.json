When I was planning the trip I noticed there was sometimes confusion between this hotel and the Town House B&B also in Glasgow (which is apparently fantastic). If you thought you were going to the Town House and ended up at the Townhouse, I can imagine you'd be quite disappointed. The Townhouse itself is fine. It was clean and servicable- definately felt like a place students and younger travelers would go. Bathroom was decent size and clean. No decor to speak of. In retrospect we should have taken a cab or bus from the main Glasgow train station. We took the subway instead and it was quite a long walk from the station. We ate at the restaurant just around the corner (can't remember the name) and it was fantastic. Breakfast in the morning was a little disapointing. The juice had a very odd taste and the food was just average.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 25, 2005", "id": 3230501}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Glasgow"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 16, "average": 7, "very good": 17, "terrible": 19, "excellent": 6}, "aka": "Townhouse Hotel Glasgow", "slim_ranking": 0.954022988506}
