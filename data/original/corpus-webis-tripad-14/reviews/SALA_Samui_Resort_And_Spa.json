Cost was \u00a3250 a night on average, for a garden pool villa, which did not include any extras like transfers or use of the spa. For that amount of money you would expect some fantastic service, however, that was not the case. The breakfast was disappointing, with items like eggs or pancakes extra, although the mango's were delicious. They even charged a ridiculous amount for bottlked water at breakfast. The best thing about this hotel is the private pool and the infinity pools. Getting around the island is expensive with fixed prices everywhere (no one uses a meter).

We were there on honeymoon. From the second we landed we were in ore of the place. Koh Samui airport is bar none the coolest airport I have ever been to. We we met by a thai lady who was soooooooooo friendly and welcoming, she took us to our car and we had a private transfer to our hotel, which on the island was not a long drive at all, 10/20 mins max. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by the staff who were again so friendly and welcoming. We had a bunch of roses given to us and had champayne when we arrived at our room. We stayed in a garden pool villa, it was out of this world. They made the beds everyday, you could have clean towels and bedding everyday. They turned the beds down everyday and came in early evening to spray mosquito spray and light the incense. We rang for room service and they were at the door before we put the phone down. The food in the restaurant was outstanding, and thats for the breakfasts, lunches and mains, albeit slightly pricey. We had 2 cocktails one night and they cost more than a meal at a little thai restaurant on the main street including drinks put together. The swimming pools were fantastic, the sun loungers were amazing. They would come round as you were sunbathing and ask if you want a free massage..... total relaxtion!!! As soon as the staff saw you coming they would lay a towel down for you, or take you to a sun lounger on the beach and do the same.", "title": "Amazing from start to finish", "user": "sara_doidge", "date": "January 27, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 94571967}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "All in all they could not do enough for you!
