Yes the hotel is very clean, and the breakfast is very good. However, the location is not great mainly due to the hotel being situated right on a noisy main road opposite some fairly drab buildings. I feel more effort could've been made by the owners to shield the hotel from this, eg: with trees at the front of the building? Also whilst the rooms are indeed spotlessly clean, they are very dull. If pure brilliant white (everywhere) is your thing, then this is the place for you, however I thought the hotel lacked character and felt a bit like a visit to my local dental surgery. I don't want to be too critical as the hotel is decent and represents reasonable value when compared with some of the other overpriced Oxford alternatives, however I'm not sure it warrants the high ratings received on Tripadvisor.

Not a hotel, but more comfy than a hotel. Nice breakfast choices. We are returning to stay there on our next trip. If you are in Oxford, don;t miss Bicester Village Factory Outlet. (Busses run from Oxford - taxis are a bit costly to get there and back). Easy if you have a car. Great prices. Bangkok House and Chiang Mai both nice Thai restaurants. Very good value Chinese Restaurant on Banbury Road a short distance from the Remont towards town. In Summertown the Portabello Restaurant (on South Parade - off Banbury Road also only a short distance away) is a nice lunchtime or dinner time place, with a good pizzeria next store. Closer in to town several restuarants worth trying - Lock Fyne in Jerico area, Cafe Rouge near by.
