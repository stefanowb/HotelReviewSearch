Most of the rooms in the main house were being refurbished & our room was brand new, very modern with great flat screen TV, excellent shower with different settings, etc. The only problem was when it rained as you did have to go outside to get between buildings. The restaurant was a wonderful old room with high ceilings, old paintings, etc. On our first night it was not a great experience (although the food was excellent) due to the restaurant & bar being taken over by very loud, drunk, corporate clients. The second night was much better. This hotel does cater for a lot of companies, so best to check before you book a romantic break! Lovely grounds & nice, helpful staff. A good location for exploring Stratford-upon-Avon & surrounded by beautiful countryside. I think when all the refurbishment is completed it will rate excellent. Just confirm if you want to be in the main house not a new block. A good pool, spa, etc, with free towels.", "title": "Great location, shame about the corporate clients!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "hazelha", "date": "October 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5897401, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Lovely historical house", "disliked": "\u2014 Loud, drunk, corporate guests"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We have just returned from a 2 night break and wished we had booked in for the week.
