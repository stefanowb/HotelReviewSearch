{"user_rating": 3.0, "review_count": 73, "name": "Hotel El Diplomatico", "reviews": [{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Hotel Not Recommended...", "text": "This hotel on the outside appearance seems really nice, and along with its decent price and close proximity to the World Trade Center does really well. But it does need to update it's decor inside, along with updating the rooms so that you don't hear the person in the next room sneezing or their intimate activities. The phone in the room had a lot of static making it very difficult for people to contact me in my room instead of on my cell phone. There was no voice mail system, so callers had to either call my cell phone for voicemail or trust the front desk to slip a note under my door. The television never worked, even after calling maintenance. And the controls for the air conditioner worked only after spending a half hour pressing the buttons really hard in order to get them to work. However, the hotel staff was more than outstanding. If anything, that is what made the stay bearable. But there is no bar, no gift ship, or mini bar. I do not recommend this hotel for business travel.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 1, 2004", "id": 2799903}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2004, traveled on business", "text": "Tried to stay a couple of nights at El Diplomatico, as it is close to the National University, but it turned out to be a waste of time and money! I called them to make a reservation, and they ensured me they had available rooms for the next day, and I could walk directly to the front desk. What a mistake I made trusting the info they gave me over the phone! When I arrived to the front desk coming directly from the bus terminal with all my luggage, they simply told me they had no rooms, and didn't even offer an apology for giving me misleading information the day before!!! No one seemed to care about the situation, nobody offered any help. I had to call Hotel Sevilla (where I regularly stay but it is a little far away from the University Campus) to make a last minute reservation, and pay a taxi from El Diplomatico to Hotel Sevilla... In 4 years visiting Mexico City regularly, this is the first time I got such a poor service from a Mexican hotel!!! Needless to say, I will never try El Diplomatico again.", "title": "A waste of time and money", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "vaquitaflor", "date": "July 15, 2004", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0}, "id": 2301562}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "good hotel in mexico", "text": "Great food, good service and well located.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 14, 2004", "id": 2187422}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good central location", "text": "Hotel is very clean and the people are friendly.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shannon067", "date": "January 4, 2004", "id": 1537820}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2003, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is very well situated.
