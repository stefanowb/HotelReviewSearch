I will always remember my 30th birthday due to our wretched room! There was NO t.v., radio, etc. Which would have been fine had we known before hand. I would have packed a book or magazine. We searched high and low in the town for a magazine, which they have none! During our stay it was raining w/ hail and very cold. Our bathroom window did not shut all the way-so we had to wear a coat to go to the bathroom and we had to keep the bathroom door shut since we had no heat in our room. After a breakfast that included charred toast, we went to take a shower and there was no hot water! We ended up leaving early so we could go home and take a hot shower. The staff was completly indifferent-even after I broke down in tears when we left. Don't believe the rave reviews on this hotels website!

The lack of electronic emenities in the room actually causes you to do something unheard of this day and age, wander down to the parlor to spend time with your lover or family, or sitting in the lobby chatting with other guests. I found this to be an extremely rewarding experience and certainly more enjoyable than watching HBO all night. I put together a puzzle for the first time since I was a kid! We also sat on the front porch with coffee late at night, watching the cars pass by (maybe 4 vehicles in an hour) and reading magazines. There is an interesting book in the parlour that describes the entire history of the hotel and makes mention of \"notable\" guests who have stayed there over the last 100-years from politicians to Johnny Cash.

Having said that, I was surprised to see a young boy, maybe 12-ish happily involved with parlor games with his mother and sibling throughout the stay so perhaps it is worth a shot to show your kids how our ancestors used to pass the time.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 30, 2005", "id": 3311232}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "I am a little biased considering my husband proposed to me here- so I will try to be fair. Upon check-in, I found the hotel to be charming. Let me just throw this out there, Julian is a small town, so if you are looking for a 4 star hotel, this is not it. But it is clean, welcoming and friendly. We found the staff to be competant and inviting, not \"dirty\" as described below. It is family run and casual, but definately not dirty. The rooms are simple, and as with most B&B style rooms, there are no televisions, which didn't bother us a bit. After all, we are there to travel, not watch TV.
