From the outside the building looks dated and we were a bit unsure what to expect when we got inside. We were amazed once we entered the hotel, it was incredible!! The hotel is absolutely beautiful! I booked our stay via the internet (which was not the best idea) as I booked a twin room on the advanced purchase ticket. I then received an email to say that they did not have any twim rooms available only doubles and that I could not get a refund. I did send them an email to complain about this and they kindly upgraded us to a suite. It was huge, the bed was a twin king size and the bathroom was massive! I couldn't say a bad word at all about the room it was so luxurious! The best hotel I have ever stayed in and we only paid \u00a365 per night. The location is not right in the centre but only 5 mins walk away from bars and restaurants etc. The bull ring is fantastic for shopping but does get very busy on the weekend. We walked there and it took us about 30 mins. The nightlife is buzzing too, we ended up in Flairs and had a fantastic night.

About 20 minutes after getting to my room it was confirmed that the appropriate notification had been received but not put on the system. The price that was charged was \u00a3158.00, an absolutely absurd price for what was a very ordinary room with basic facilities (half this price would have been more realistic - just). As for the room it was as I say basic, pretty ordinary.
