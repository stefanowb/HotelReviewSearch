Apparently the mall is used as a thoroughfare by the locals and this included people with no mufflers and folks who believe the music in their cars needs to be heard by everyone within a 2 mile radius. We were woken several times during the night by this kind of noise. We later realized that there was two pizza joints in the strip mall, and a Buffalo Wild Wings on the other side of the Holiday Inn. We suspect these establishments might have drawn the rowdier motorists. My main point here is that we could HEAR all this through the windows.
