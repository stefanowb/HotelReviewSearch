I could have stayed at an old Motel 6 and have gotten just a little less. The restaurant was expensive but the meal was not nice. It took forever to get your food and we were the only ones in the restaurant and I ordered Nachos. The place smelled stale and I felt that we were put in the old part of the building because we booked with hotwire. The room had no bathroom fan, was small and outdated. The a/c was not cooling the room. The lamps did not work, the tour bus did not run on time and the place was outdated especially for a three star hotel. I definately would not go there again at that price, maybe for 35-40 dollars but certainly not for what I paid for it. I was very disappointed that a Holiday Inn was so far away from my expectations. I thought that Holiday Inn was a quality hotel. I was wrong....at least at this location. I would be very hesitant to stay at another..", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 21, 2006", "id": 5372291}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006, traveled on business", "text": "This hotel is seriously old, the new \"updates\" dont come close to helping. The common spaces are dated and crowded, the entire place smells. I was there for two days, the halls were not airconditioned, and my A/C went out twice, since it is right by the airport and the highway, the noise is bad enough with the windows closed, the pool is closed. the fitness room has two treadmills on which the betls are soo loose they slide with every step, definatly a danger. Worse yet there are many people milling in and out, and they left the back doors propped open during the day. It is not in a nice neighborhood, and I actually felt unsafe!!!
