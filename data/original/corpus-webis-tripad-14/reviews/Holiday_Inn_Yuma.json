As I am a platinum card holder - hunted out the Holiday Inn - which is difficult as there are no signs once you are off the Freeway! Got a walk-in rate of $99 - plus the obligatory hidden US taxes.(why cant you just include the taxes???)

What a beautiful new motel. Town was packed because of car shows and other events so the hotel was booked. Beds were comfortable, service was great, staff was friendly. Pool area was nice even though overcrowded one afternoon. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and will if we go down again next winter. Lots of activities and good eating in same area. Also lots of good shopping.
