The hotel is only 5 months old and was very clean, bright and obviously updated. The lobby was quite spacious and bright and had a nice bar area. They also have a breakfast for 9.99 that is nice in the morning (fresh fruit, pastries, toast, eggs, omelets, waffles). The room is spacious and nicely appointment. The rooms have wi-fi. I'd recommend this hotel in a heartbeat!", "user": "BornToTravel", "date": "November 8, 2007", "id": 10700590}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled on business", "text": "My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night, as did a handfull of our guests. Our suite was huge, with a large living room and kitchen area separate from the bedroom. The kitchen area came complete with microwave, sink, and refrigerator. Our bed was exquisitely comfortable with tons of pillows- after a fun filled, but exhausting, day, it was the perfect place to rest our heads. The hotel provided all of us with a complimentary shuttle to and from the reception hall. For a small fee ($100), they kept that bar open for us until 1:00am, allowing us to keep the party going a little longer. The breakfast buffet in the morning was great- omelette and waffle stations, hash browns, bacon, sausage, fruits, cereals, and more- just about something for everyone- and they kept it open until 11:00am- later than most hotels I've ever stayed at. I really had no complaints at all.", "title": "Loved this hotel!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "QueenzTravlr", "date": "November 3, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 10573201, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 A most comfortable bed", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The location is great for staying in Long Island; it is on Route 110 which is lined from North to South with stores and businesses of all sorts, and is intersected by every major highway.
