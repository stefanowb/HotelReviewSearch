Very nice, ok location but 10 minute drive away from the actual \"downtown\" of Sheboygan. Rooms were clean, nicely decorated, no musty smells, only 3 towels for 2 people, again. Air conditioner was decent, quiet, did not run the entire time which is nice. Mattress was very comfortable, but the 4 pillows on the bed have seen better days & need to be replaced in the worst way. Staff was very nice, we appreciated that one of the girls had a giant notebook filled with mapquests to local attractions, including a specific restaurant we wanted to go to, along with positive recommendations. We really did not appreciate that we had to pay a rate of $132.99 for Friday nite, but $155.99 for Saturday nite. As if Sheboygan is a big hot spot...we are coming back next year for the same show, but will not be staying here at those rates.

Great experience, great customer service, nice room, nice complimentary breakfast, close to Lake Michigan. We fell in love with Sheboygan. Only thing I would change is the staffs uniforms I thought I was in a Dr. Office. Lots of shopping in walking distance. Amanada at the front desk went above and beyond the call of duty to resolve a medical issue which was outstanding.
