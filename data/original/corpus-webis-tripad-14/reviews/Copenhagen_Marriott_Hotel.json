I booked through a 3rd party selling rooms at a discount - we booked B&B in a city-view room, but (and I know this was lucky) we got upgraded to an executive canal-view room, with exec lounge access thrown in as well. Room was spotless and well presented. Only minor niggles I can think of are the shower has a tendency to distribute water rather liberally about the bathroom and the extraction system can be heard from the room. As others say, good location for Kobnhavns H station but a wee bit of a stroll to Nyhavn for those who are not used to walking.
