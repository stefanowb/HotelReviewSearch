I called the front desk to request a different room and no one picked up the phone. So I walked back to the front desk, waited about 10 minutes for someone to return and eventually got a different room. While this room had a window, it (like the majority of the rooms with windows) looked out onto the rooftop mechanical system of the building next door. The room was small (European small), smelled musty, the carpet was stained and paint was peeling. I set the air conditioning as low as it could go yet it remained warm and stuffy during my stay (and this was mild weather in March). Noise carried through the building. You could hear anytime someone flushed a toilet or took a shower. If you are a light sleeper, you don\u2019t stand a chance. Like other reviewers, I had a bathmat on the first night. Never saw it again. The room had an ironing board but no iron. After asking, they delivered me one. Unfortunately, it was old and rusty and stained my white shirt.", "title": "Stay away!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "traveler678", "date": "March 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 1.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 7219387}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Nightmare \"hotel\" in the Big Easy", "text": "The \u201cbusiness center\u201d was a PC with a broken printer housed in the same room (or closet) as a vending machine.
