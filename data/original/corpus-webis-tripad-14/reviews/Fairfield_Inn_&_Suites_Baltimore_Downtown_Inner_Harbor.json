The property was not much to look at from the outside, but inside it wasquite attractive. Brick walls in the lobby were a bit dark but whimsical furnishings, flooring and art made the atmosphere fun and unique. As an eco-hotel, there's an emphasis on recycling, \"green\" products, etc, though I can't say that it was really evident during breakfast.The courtyard was very comfortable to use with an interesting water feature. There is no pool, and there's a tavern attached to the lobby, so it's a bit more \"grown up\" perhaps than some Fairfield Inns, but the location is perfect for families visiting the Inner Harbor, National Aquarium, Little Italy, etc...

The clerk worked with me to find a solution, first offering me a different type of room at a much higher price and then, when I expressed my disappointment in the additional costs, looked to find a handicapped room with 2 Qs and asked if we would be okay with it. Turns out this room was huge and had plenty of room for a rollaway. We were very comfortable.
