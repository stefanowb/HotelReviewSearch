I would recommend to take a bottle of sun lotion in your hand luggage because just from the walk over to our coach from the airport, i got sunburnt, and it was only a 100metre walk, if that, and i am someone with olive skin who dosent burn that much!! Not complaining about it though, we came for the sun and it didnt let us down. Dont give in to the people that take your luggage, they do just go for your suitcase without asking, and you think that its for free to take them over to your coach but its not, they wouldnt let go of them until you gave them some money.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "riuhater", "date": "February 11, 2008", "id": 13461922}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled with friends", "text": "Check In:", "title": "loved the riu taino", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "sippi215", "date": "February 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 13365231, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 fun and friendly staff", "disliked": "\u2014 twin beds"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "I cant understand why anyone can moan about this hotel????

We went for a 2 week stay and were not disappointed! The airport was a bit confusing as far as not really knowing how to find our bus to take us to the resort. We sort of had to wander around with all of our luggage in a maze full of buses of various sizes in the airport parking lot. This was a bit frustrating but we finally managed to find the right one to take us to the hotel. The Riu was a 30 minute bus ride away. Once there the check in went very smoothly and we were even able to move to a room closer to our friends without a problem. The rooms were clean and more than sufficient. I'm not sure how much time people spend in rooms, but having a balcony a clean bathroom, a comfortable bed and airconditioning made this room wonderful. We enjoyed 2 weeks of sunshine and hot weather. The beach is breathtaking with soft white sand and extraordinary blue clear water. We spent most of our days laying on the beach chairs by the water and it was never a problem to get chairs. There were reefs close by that made for fun snorkeling--all kinds of neat fish that would come eat banana right out of your hand. The water is very clear so even if you don't have a mask (which you can also borrow from your resort) you can see the fish come up to the surface of the water for food. We took a catamaran out a few times and that was alot of fun. They are very easy to sail and don't take much skill. If you're nervous you can take a lesson for $25 but it was very easy to get the hang of so save your money and just give it a shot. You can use the catamarans, snorkeling equipment, windsurfers, paddle boats and kayakes for free. You just have to go up and book them (1 hour time slots) with the people at one of the booths. There were a bunch of beach vendors that were set up down the beach from our resort and we took many trips down the beach to do some shopping. Of course they insist they are giving you the very best price while all along quoting a price that is often 4 times higher than what you actually should pay. Haggling is the name of the game! There are lots of paintings, jewellery, sarongs, t-shirts, and wood carvings. We only did one excersion and that was the catamaran trip to Saona Island. This trip took us on an hour and a half bus ride to and from the pick up location. That part was exhausting. I didn't like spending 3 hours on a bus--even though it was air conditioned. The catamaran trip out to the island was really fun with music, dancing and lots of rum. Once we got to the island, it was rather disappointing. Although it is beautiful, it was no more beautiful than our own beach at the resort. It was apparently a little windy that day so it wasn't calm which is its claim to fame. Then we stopped at a \"natural pool\" on the way back in the motor boats, but really it was just an area of the ocean that didn't have waves. Boring! We did find one star fish there though. The a la carte restaurants were good and there was no limit as to how many times we ate at them which was probably 10 out of 13 nights. Our favourite was the Mexican restaurant where they made you fresh quesadillas. The steak house was good too and a bit of a surprise to have good steak while in the Dominican. The food at the buffets were more than adequate with lots of selection. I personally loved the fresh fruit smoothies blended every morning! I worked out in the gym and they had free weights as well as treadmills, steppers, and bikes. No airconditioning there only a few slow moving fans. But hey, it made me feel like I was really working hard with all the sweat pouring off of me! There is a street right next to the hotel called Caribe Street where there are all kinds of shops including clothing stores,painting store, a drug store, a confectionary (chips $5, chocolate bars $3), bathing suit store, stores with blow kids toys and air mattresses. Many of the tourists came from Europe with very few from the States and about 20% from Canada. Many of the staff could speak some english or at least enough to communicate with one another. The bartenders at the La Bamba bar were exceptional and we made some good friends! The Domincans really love their sugar and the majority of their drinks were quite sweet which got a bit much after a few days there. Also, they only had Pepsi and being Coke fans, that was a little disappointing. We booked through Sunquest and they had a Sunquest rep there to help us with anything we needed. When it was time to go the airport to leave, we were supposed to check the Sunquest binder to see if our plane was on time and when we did, it said that the plane was on time so we went to the airport. We ended up waiting there an extra 3 hours for our plane which was really frustrating because those were 3 hours we could have hung on the beach instead of at an airport. All in all we would definitely go back to this resort and to this country. We would also book with Riu again in other countries as this resort met all of our expectations!
