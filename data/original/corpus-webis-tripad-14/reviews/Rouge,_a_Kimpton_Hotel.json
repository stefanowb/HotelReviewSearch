The decor has tons of red in it, and it's certainly not your typical chain hotel. It's a converted apartment building and it shows. I liked the decor and the free wireless internet access. What didn't I like? The bed was a little soft. The room was somewhat dark (to enhance the funky feeling, I'm sure), and that made it hard for me to work going through papers and using my laptop. I would have liked more overhead light. I forgot a toothbrush, and they did not offer complementary ones ... they were $5.50 from the minibar! Finally, the bar on the ground floor of hotel allows smoking, so when you walk in, you are assaulted by a blast of nasty cigarette smoke. The hotel is very similar to the other nearby Kimpton Hotel, Hotel Madera, at least in terms of funky decore. But Hotel Madera has a better location and no nasty smoke pit on the first floor.

Found a great rate of $129 on the hotel website (September 2006). Pleasantly surprised, and I'd recommend this hotel to any type of traveller. I did my research looking for a clean, modern hotel in a good neighborhood at a reasonable rate - not many to be found in DC. King room was HUGE and I believe most rooms are quite large. Nice white linens with down comforter. Rooms have a red vibe with black accents. Large full-length mirror, leather headboards, an innovative minibar with candy and such. CD player with iPod input was a good extra (bring your own iPod adaptor). Service (from booking to room service) was solid. Location's great in Dupont Circle which is one of the sweetest 'pedestrian friendly' areas in DC with good restaurants and shops, yet the White House is several blocks from the hotel. Aveda products are a nice plus. As are animal-print robes. Note that there's a putatively 'swanky lounge'-type place as part of the ground floor, and there is something of a smoke smell that seems to permeate to the hallways a bit. At least some of the vibe is a party hotel on weekends.
