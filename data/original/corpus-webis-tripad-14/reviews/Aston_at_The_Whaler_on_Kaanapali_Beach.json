The shopping in Lahaina was very touristy but fun. We ended up buying a painting at gallery night as a remembrance. The store Maui Hands in Paia and Lahaina has some great pieces at affordable prices. Also, the Maui's own art and craft fair has some wonderful deals at low prices. The price tags at this craft fair were usually reduced by 40-50% when asked what the price was and dealers were willing to negotiate. We stayed on West Maui at The Whaler and it was a great location. Right on the beach. The pool always had chairs available as well. The location with the shopping center right next door and restaurants was awesome at Whaler's Village. We drove the road to Hana. Even though it was beautiful, I would take 2 days instead of one to do this. We started at 6 AM and made it to the seven sacred pools by 2:30 PM. The Twin Falls waterfalls was amazing. I would skip driving up to the Haleakala crater. Maybe we were just tired of driving, but we did this one morning, and definitely saw better sites on the road to Hana. Do the Road to Hana or the crater, not both. We will definitely return to Maui for another vacation...probably would stay in West Maui for a few nights and then in South Maui a few nights.
