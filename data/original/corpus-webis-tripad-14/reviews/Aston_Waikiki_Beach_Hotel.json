A supervisor apologized for the inconvenience and said she was \u201cupgrading\u201d us to a better room. The new room had an ocean view which wasn\u2019t bad but it was located right above Tiki\u2019s bar and had 2 double beds instead of the king we had requested when we made our reservation. Since we were tired from our flight we thought we would give the room a try. Needless to say, the noise from Tiki\u2019s and trying to sleep on a small bed was horrible and we got little sleep that night. The next day after returning from Pearl Harbor we went back to the front desk to see if we could change rooms. After watching the guy behind the counter play with his keyboard for 10 minutes he told us the only thing available would cost us an additional $60 a night! We told him we wouldn\u2019t pay any more for another room and that we had requested a king bed and a room on a higher floor and his response was that rooms are not guaranteed. So after another 5 minutes of keyboard punching he said a room with a king bed would be available the next day which we said would be fine. Then he informed us that in order to change rooms we would have to check out the next morning and recheck in after 3pm! We thought that this was very unusual and questioned him to see if we heard him correct and was again told the same thing. Being quite irritated with this guy, we said okay and went to our room. After we got to our room, we decided that checking out and back in again was a disaster waiting to happen with this place. My wife called the front desk and spoke to a supervisor and explained the situation and was told that we did not have to check out and back in again and to just keep our belongings in the room until we were ready to switch rooms.
