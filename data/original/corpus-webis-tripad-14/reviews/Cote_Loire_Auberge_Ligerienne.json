It is a very cozy inn - more akin to a B&B than a hotel. The double rooms are quite small and I would recommend them only to single travelers with limited luggage. Couples should opt for larger rooms or those with 2 beds. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, some of the furnishings are a bit dated and I would love to see some upgrade of the decor, since this is a fine old, historic building with charm. The building lacks air conditioning so it may be a concern for visitors staying during the hottest months. The above concerns notwithstanding, the Cote Loire has a wonderful location on the River Loire, the owners are cordial, the service is friendly and efficient, and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds. Of particlar note, the Cote Loire has a restaurant which serves very good food and a nice selection of regional wines and armagnac (brandy).
