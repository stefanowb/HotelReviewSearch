The Reception was good and the meal (for +20 people) was efficiently served and for the most part of good quality. Breakfast the following morning was also good. I had asked for a \"pleasant\" room which cost me \u00a3100 p.n., a suplement of \u00a325 on the standard room. It was on the ground floor and approx. 5m x 5m. There was a very high ceiling. The decor was cold and the furnishing very utilitarian - open wardrobe and shelving (no draws) and an MFI table with only a straight chair. I stayed at a Travel-lodge for \u00a329 the week before that had much more atmosphere about it. The bed was kingsize. In the corner was a \"porta-cabin\" that rose to about two-thirds the height of the room, which held the shower etc and which had an opaque glass door that did not fit. There was complimentary water. The small bottle of red wine (contents of which were not complimentary) was used to prop open the large sash-window which insisted on falling gilloutine-like without it. If I'd paid an extra \u00a325 on top of \u00a350 I would still have been critical. When I told reception that I was disappointed with the room I was told that it was the biggest in the hotel!

I loved the blue paint in the entrance/bar/restaurant areas and the white printed signs on the paintwork. The wall of wine was eye catching too. The 'early diner' menu was lovely although my husband's chocolate mousse was still frozen when it came and very amusing to watch him eat! Again the staff were super and very friendly which contributed to the atmosphere in the hotel. Breakfast was varied and good value.
