The front desk people were friendly and helpful. The room was quiet even though I had people on both sides. I had a refrigerator. coffee pot, and microwave in the room. There was a nice outdoor pool for summer use. The only food establishment within walking distance was a truck stop, but they also recommended a few restaurants with delivery.

We thought it would be a nice place to stay because it was just past the city of St. Louis and out of the congested area. Also, the Best Western name is typically good, so we decided to stop here. We were VERY pleased with our decision. The rate was about $85 for four of us and the room was great. There were two queen beds and still plenty of space to move around. In fact, this room was better than the room we paid $115 for in KC. Keep in mind, we were only here to sleep. We did not visit the pool or use any of the hotel's services. We did stop to look at the breakfast before departing. It was VERY basic - muffins, cereal, etc., and there was not a lot of space to sit in their small dining area.
