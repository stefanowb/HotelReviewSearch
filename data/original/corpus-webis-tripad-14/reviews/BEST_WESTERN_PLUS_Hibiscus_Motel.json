As a family of four with two big teenagers, we all stayed in one standard room and found it to be very comfortable. Room was very clean and everything seemed new and fresh. There was a small fridge and microwave in the room, additional sink and mirror outside the bathroom and a large flat screen TV. The only things we could nitpick about was the noise from the A/C and bathroom fan was a bit loud but nothing we couldn't handle. There is a nice pool area with lots of shade and palm trees. The pool was obviously heated - too warm for our taste, but I think many people like pool temps in the mid to high 80's (not us). There was free breakfast, free parking and free internet. I dont think you will find this at too many hotels in Key West. I would rate BW Hibiscus as a very good value. Location is very good too. It is is old town Key West, right across the street from the Southernmost Hotel. Good restaurants within walking distance and just a very short walk to Duval Street. It is a bit too far to walk to the boardwalk and north end of the Key. One piece of advice to this hotel and some of its staff that would make it 5 stars IMO...smile, say good morning or good afternoon and pretend you like having guests staying there. This goes a long way to making guests feel welcome. Nothing that would stop us from staying here again, but we would have rated it even higher.", "title": "Good Value in Key West", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "J-Roc123", "date": "January 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 149033607}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with family", "text": "A nice place with an excellent pool area, very close to the quiet and southernmost area of Key West.

Last year my wife and I spent a night here in March during spring break and it was not relaxing as we wanted. The college kids took over the poolside area playing beer pong in the pool. They set up their table on inflatable lounge mats in the shallow end and the beer was spilling over into the pool all the while management saw this going on. When I approached the front desk with this, they said the kids spend a lot of money to stay here also, and should have fun too,... Wow, are you kidding! I was able to speak with a couple of kids, and they said they were sleeping 4-8 per room without management knowing and only paying for 2 in a room. They split the cost equally keeping it affordable for them. Some kids slept on floor. I should have spent my $280.00 elsewhere.

The pharmacy formerly across the street from the Hibiscus has closed alas and turned into a bank - it sued to have great fish sandwiches and also cafe con leche.
