Very clean and modern. Its at the end of a back street right off the Roman Forum. You enter in a traditional style old door and go up 3 floors of concrete steps and white washed walls of a quaint old Roman building. Once you enter the Relais its jumped forward in time - very very clean, sleek and modern. There are only 4 rooms and a small check in desk. The guy who runs it is so friendly and helpful. He offered us a bottle of wine as we had got married in July. While we strictly were not on honeymoon - but still in honeymoon phase I felt this very generous.", "title": "Perfect accomodation - will stay there again!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "T_Quetta", "date": "August 3, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 36642198}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We slept soundly, not a pick of noise, great air con, cumfy pillows and blinds and curtains (not often found in Rome).
