Beautiful private villa with your own private pool and nice landscaping. Staff are friendly and helpful, they even gave us a quick go on the Segway- but only in the driveway. We had indonesian friends visit and security on the gate asked for ID, even though my husband greeted our friends at the gate. The bed was huge and comfortable. The TV only had 1 english speaking movie channel with bad reception and UK news and Bloomberg. They did have Japanese channels. There is a DVD player in the room so if you buy DVD's in Bali you could watch these. Breakfast was good and served in your villa at a time that suited you, with a choice of Western Japanese Indonesian and Dusini special- eggs benedict. Our first night we could hear singing but it wasn't loud enough to keep us awake although the resident gecko did. We were staying in villa 1, the closest to reception, but villa is enclosed with its own gate so it does feel very private. I enquired about Spa treatments at Disini and they are expensive and in US dollars, across the road is Ulin villas and spa. Treatments are almost half the price and you don't need to be a guest to use the private spa there.", "title": "Nice stay at a Disini Villa", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "tf1966", "date": "February 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 56012712}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "We walked in off the road and asked the price at Dusini Luxury Villa AU$225 per night low season.
