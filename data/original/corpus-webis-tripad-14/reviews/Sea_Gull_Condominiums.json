My family has rented at the Seagull since the late 80's - probably 20 or more stays in all. We've NEVER had a bad experience. Over the years seen the staff cooly handle situations ranging from power failures to a freak tornado which came right through the property (broken glass; family moved to an unaffected unit; no problem!) This place is perfect except for the lack of a proper fish-cleaning station... (but you can take your catch and sneak over to the SandPiper next door - they have a beautiful gazebo-style screened fish-cleaning set-up!) But here's what's great about the Seagull: in all the units, you are right on the beach in a well-appointed living space with a balcony set up for a truly great view. If this is what is important to you, consider booking the ultimate experience in the three-bedroom units high up in the building - the ones with numbers ending in \"5\". Those floor plans are V shaped with balconies looking north toward Port Aransas AND South toward Packery Channel. The glass walls of the living rooms in those units open on to both views so you can take in the whole beach front of the entire island. You and your family will feel like kings of the world!
