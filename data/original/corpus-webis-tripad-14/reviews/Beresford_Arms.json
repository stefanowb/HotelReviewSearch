Nothing else) Don't expect fruit juice or anything savoury. The complimentary wine in the late afternoon is a nice touch, though once again, don't ask for juice or soda instead.

The room itself was pretty dated but we had a large bathroom with shiny, floral wallpaper, deep bathtub, bidet and 2 sinks. It made getting ready VERY easy and comfortable. We also had a kitchen, which was great because it cut costs on food since we brought our own and heated it up in the oven. There was no salt though, so bring your own if you think you'll need it. The room was decently sized, we fit 7 people, 4 in beds, 3 on the floor. The downside was no AC, luckily SF is cool enough at night so we could get away with opening windows. We did hear some rooms DO have AC though, you just have to specify when you make the reservation. We also called ahead and requested to be put in a room with a kitchen. The hotel was located in an OK area, you just have to be a little careful walking down certain streets at night as they fill up with homeless people. Then again, so does the rest of SF.
