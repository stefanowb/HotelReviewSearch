The food at the hotel is real good value for money and the portions were very filling. The only downside to the hotel is that my neghbour decided to have a bath at 1am in the morning and the noise levels from them filling up the bath were extreme. The accommodation is separate from the main reception building so was a little worrying for a woman alone.
