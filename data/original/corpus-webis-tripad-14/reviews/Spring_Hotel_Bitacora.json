All the reports you read are true about this hotel, great food, very clean, polite and very friendly staff. Located in great position as we had our son and his friend both aged 17 and our daughter and boyfriend aged 18 and 19 so they could visit all the pubs and clubs within a short distance and my wife and i had a quieter time locally visiting bars and restaraunts near the hotel (perfect balance). The one criticism i would aim at the hotel is the ridiculous fiasco of trying to get a sunbed each morning, to stand any chance we had to set our alarm for 7am and then join all the others who had got up even earlier so in the end we didnt bother and went to the beach most days which was much better and only a nice ten minute walk. If you want a great evening out try the HOLE IN THE WALL", "title": "Best holiday yet", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "robbo 2303", "date": "July 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5468430}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "enjoyed the break", "text": "pub which is Irish orientated but whatever nationality you are there is such a great welcoming hospitality and atmosphere that i guarantee you,ll be back for more, plus Fergal Flaherty who sings there each night will keep you well entertained.
