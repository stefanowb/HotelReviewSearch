Previous reviewer said the \"the rooms were small\" - of course, this opinion is relative, but if you look at photos of the hotel the balcony is small. However, the rooms go off at an angle to the balcony, giving, what was to us, a normal European sized room. The design objective is to give most of the hotel's rooms a sea view. A good, practical design, but it doesn't do the hotel any favours in the brochure.", "title": "Great service, very good food, but very poor rooms", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "sipivu", "date": "July 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 5507326, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff and sunday night diner", "disliked": "\u2014 very poor rooms and location"}}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Languedoc-Roussillon", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 23, "average": 40, "very good": 69, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 20}, "aka": "Accor Thalassa Port Camargue", "slim_ranking": 0.470588235294, "description": "Located 4 km from the centre of Le Grau du Roi looking across to the largest beach in the Camargue.
