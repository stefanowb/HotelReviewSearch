Even though the rooms do need a facelift, this was some of the best service we have experienced in our 5 years living and travelling through Asia. The rooms are spaceous and comfortable, and with a great view, the beach was clean with great white sand, and the food was very good, with very good variety. We hired a car to tour the island at the transportation desk, and also hired a diving instructor and snorkling guide, all of them very good experiences. But the best was the quality of the service...our daughters have food allergies, and the entire staff of the hotel became aware instantly, and were always careful...the person cleaning the room, the amazing servers at the bar and restaurant, the staff at the spa, and the very friendly and professional people at the front desk, all deserve a round of applause for surprising and delighting us at every turn.
