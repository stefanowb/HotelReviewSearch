I went into work (at a dermatology clinic) that day and asked some of the residents to confirm that the lesions did indeed resemble insect bites. When I got home that day, I removed the sheets from my bed and saw a bed bug (I knew it was a bed bug since I am in medical school and I have studied pictures of bed bugs). I asked to change rooms and I received no apology and had to move rooms by myself. I left the pillow I had brought from home in the first room since it could have been infested, but the next day after I get back from washing all of my clothes, I found it in my new room - the staff had brought it to me even after they should have known the other room was infested. I woke up in my new room with more bites and I had to move rooms again. After all of this, the hotel still denies that there are bed bugs in the hotel and refuses to even compensate me for my dry cleaning bill (which was necessary to prevent the bugs from coming home with me in any potentially infested clothing). They disrespected me in front of other guests and insinuated that I was making the whole thing up despite the blistering red welts all over my arms, hands, face and neck. There is a fundamental lack of knowledge and respect for the decency of a fellow human-being by every staff member I encountered while at this hotel.", "title": "This Place Has Bed Bugs - Stay Away!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "achuck13", "date": "October 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 82901046}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Can't possibly say enough positive things about this hotel.

It was close enough to downtown where we went to the Art Museum to see the King Tut Exhibit and to Elitch Gardens and way easy to get on the I 25 for our day out of the city to Garden of the Gods and The Royal Gorge Bridge. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone needing to stay in the Downtown Denver area. And we will stay again in this hotel for sure.

The fitness center was great, hot breakfast each morning and dinner in the evenings. The hotel is located right off the 16th Street Mall so you are close to everything downtown. We had four adults (two couples). The problem was that one couple got the bedroom and the other couple got a crappy old fold out couch that extended out to the tv stand so the person on the far side had to crawl over the bed to get to the rest of the room. Sleeping on the bed wasn't the least bit comfortable. The other problem with the room was that the bathroom was IN the bedroom--the sink part at least. Try brushing your teeth with another couple in their pj's lying on the bed. The toilet and shower stall were in their own room but you had to walk through the bedroom to get there. Try holding your bladder all night after a certain age. For a family, it would have been all right but it was uncomfortable for two couples.
