The beach views were amazing and as it was beginning to storm, the seas were really high and quite noisy, which I really liked. A great location, very clean and comfortable. Cheryl and Malcolm are a lovely couple they give you enough space and time to unwind and are also happy to have a chat. Lovely breakfast and conversation with other guests.
