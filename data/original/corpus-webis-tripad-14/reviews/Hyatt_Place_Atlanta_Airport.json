For that reason I got a good deal. I do not feel like I over paid. The hotel is pretty dated as far as the elevators, hallways, pool and fitness center are concerned. The room was decent and very large, space was the highlight of the room. The beds were a little hard but decent. The remote to the tv didnt have a back on it. I called down for housekeeping and was transferred to a voicemail. No one ever returned my call, had to call again a few hours later and the agent at the desk assited me. It was a lot of little things that affected my stay at this hotel. On the other hand the breakfast was good to be complimentary, had a variety to choose from and the staff was nice as well. The dining area was pretty small for the amount of people that were down there. It was easier to take the breakfast to the room. I didnt like the location either. I was there on business, but everything was so far away as far as activities are concerned. This area is definately not a prime location.

The ladies at the counter were not presentable hair wise and they were half dressed .Their attitudes were like someone owed them something very unpleasant. Also my debit card was charged 162 dollars. I paid for my room with hotwire in early December . No one was authorized to run the card they did it because no one looked at the notes. My daughters who are ten and six notice the unprofessionalism and the attitudes. My daughters found a huge what looked like an over sized tick climbing out of the lights in between the beds of our room. Also the breakfast was terrible, at the end of breakfast I saw a gentleman who worked there picking up the pancakes with his hands and putting them back in the pan. Those were the same pancakes that were put out the next day. Also I asked to speak to the manager and him or her did not come out twice. The best thing about this hotel were the cleaning ladies.
