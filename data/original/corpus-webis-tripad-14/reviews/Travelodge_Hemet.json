We had a room with a kitchenette and everything was spotless. The only problem we had was the the motel is next door to a Denny's Restaurant with a lounge, and at 1:00 a.m. someone with a VERY loud stereo in their car pulled into the parking lot and sat there for nearly an hour with the stereo turned up high. We didn't call the front desk because we didn't think they could do anything about it. The next morning when we checked out my husband mentioned it and was told that they've had that problem before and can't get any cooperation from Denny's. He suggested next time that we should call the police, which we will. Other than that situation, which isn't the motel's fault, it was a very pleasant stay.", "user": "mtemu", "date": "May 13, 2005", "id": 3468896}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Hemet"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 12, "very good": 13, "terrible": 9, "excellent": 7}, "aka": "Best Western Hemet", "slim_ranking": 0.5}
