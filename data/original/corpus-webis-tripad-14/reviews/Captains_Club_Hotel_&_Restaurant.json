We waited and waited to even be asked if we wanted a drink, eventually being 'noticed' and an order was taken. We asked for menus to look at as we had booked and were already 10 minutes behind on the time we had asked for a table. After approx. 10 minutes we were given 1 menu between 4 of us! Still no drinks, meanwhile newcomers to the bar had been served. Eventually our order was taken, but there were various items which had been removed (it was only 8 pm!) We asked to be seated and wine order taken. This was grudgingly done and we carried our own drinks to the table!! The food was decidedly indifferent and the service poor - to the extent that we had to complain and this is truly not something we usually do, plus the embarrassment of having taken friends, who will certainly never go again. I would like to add that we are not cheapskates, as we were drinking champagne! Sorry, they need to realise that the 'yuppies' at the bar are not the only customers, and neither do they eat! It is sad, as this is a lovely setting, position, and could be a favourite venue for us - As it is we will need a lot of persuading to feel we want to risk spending a fairly considerable amount of money there again.", "title": "Nice food, worst service ever!", "user": "MPS027", "date": "July 21, 2013", "detail_rating": {"value": 2.0, "service": 1.0}, "id": 168459922}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Enjoyable evening!", "text": "We visited on a Saturday night and whilst the guys making the cocktail surpassed themselves as ever the restaurant was a let down. We've been going to this place for several years and up till now it's been somewhere to look forward to. It now seems someone has had the idea of catering for a wider audience and in doing so dropped standards significantly. Just like a previous reviewer we could get anything without having to ask for it and anything ordered took ages to arrive. The first disappointment was the menu whereby the old al-la-carte is gone and you are handed a one size fits all version. I never thought I'd see snacks and burgers on the menu here. Even though we arrived in plenty of time and the restaurant was not full I still had to find someone to ask when our table would be ready. Also changed is the wine list and no longer is it a well organised and classy looking thing but now down graded to 2 sides of laminated A4 closey listing whats on offer. We got te distinct feeling that noone was in charge and noone really cared which was a stark contrast to our last visit.
