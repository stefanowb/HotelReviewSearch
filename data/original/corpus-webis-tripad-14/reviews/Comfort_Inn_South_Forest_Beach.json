I have seen great hotels, poor hotels, and many in between. This will by far be my most memorable experience due to the extreme inconveniences imposed on myself and family. I DEFINATELY expected better from a hotel in Hilton Head, SC. Before I get to the bugs....the check in desk is located in a seperate building from the rooms, so your must either drag, drive, or be \"shuttled\" with your belongings to the other building. For all you chronic key demagnitizers, this could be a real problem. Breakfast is also served in the other building, but before you decide to stroll down there in the morning, grab your car and find a breakfast other than coffee, poorly made juice, and raisin bran. The rooms also do not come with a microwave or refridgerator...that is additional, a real drag for a person like myself who finds those necessary and generally expects all rooms to come with them. The first night of my stay my husband and I woke up with a few bites on our hands/arms. We thought nothing of it and attributed them to a mosquito. The next night when I got back to the hotel after work I had no additional bites. Knowing we were checking out in the morning, I laid out the next days clothes for all of us and loaded additional things back into the car. I went to bed and woke up an hour later because I felt something biting me. I searched everywhere but did not see anything....I switched beds and went to sleep....when I woke up I had over 60 red swollen itchy bites all over my arms and hands and a few on my legs. Whats worse, is that while I was getting ready for work, putting make-up on etc, things were still biting me, but I COULD NOT SEE THEM. Very scary. Welt after itchy welt appearred...what the heck kind of thing bites your fingers?!?!?! Well, I had to go to work, got dressed and headed down to the other building with my husband to show them my arms and the few bites he got on his wrist. They only said that they would tell \"someone.\" I went to work where I realized I was still getting bitten. My cowowrkers where trying their best not to treat me life a leper. I had my husband arrange for me to go to a walki-in clinic during lunch so I could get some piece of mind. I rushed out to the clinic, they were sooooooo NICE to fit me in right before closing time on a Saturday. The Doctor could not pinpoint what was biting me, but gave me 4, YES FOUR prescriptions to take both orally and topically, and suggested to put everything cloth in the dryer on high heat for a while and quarantine everything else for several days. After my husband dropped me off for work he went back to the Comfort Inn to let them know that I had seen a Doctor and had been written four prescriptions. They said they would let a manager know.....The real nightmare began when we got home and I had to strip the whole family down and rush them in to wash off the \"cooties.\" I spent almost 2 hours unloading the car, seperating the cloth things for the dryer and putting them in plastic bags. I cannot have my toiletries, baby items, car, stroller or anything else for several days as they sit in quarantine. I paid almost $150 to see the doctor, another $120 in prescription medications, and over $200 at the grocery store once I got home to replace necessities I would not be able to use for several days.

Stay some where else. I looked at this hotel on the web and it was totally different from what I expected. It's old and needs to be refurnished. I'll never stay at this hotel again... even for free!

Arriving at 1pm we were told our room wasn't ready yet so went out for lunch and returned. After checking in we went to the 'living quarters' and were told we had to check-in at another location. We were somewhat confused but it turned out to be a timeshare desk set up within the hotel. Fortunately this was the last run-in with the timeshare people although they appeared to be present in this second lobby area day and night. This lobby area didn't give the best first impression of a hotel as it smelt a tad funny and looked rather grubby and was a flashback to the 1970s in terms of decor. The hotel lift was also pretty rickety and took a day and an age to arrive at all encounters.
