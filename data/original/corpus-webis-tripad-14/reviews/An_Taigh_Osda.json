It's a hotel, not a B&B, and the prices reflect that, but it's worth it for a great stay. I recommend getting one of the slightly more expensive rooms as they are much bigger and have a seating area which is nice if you are with friends. However, the residents lounge also works for that if you have the smaller rooms. The beds are very comfortable and the furnishings elegant. Paul and Joan are friendly, interesting and helpful hosts and the food is wonderful...not OTT but beautifully cooked and presented. The whisky selection is fine, with advice from Paul, and there's a good wine list.", "user": "Scott04shark", "date": "April 14, 2009", "id": 27988703}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Gem of a small hotel!", "text": "Well, what can we say that hasn\u2019t already been said. This is a gem of a small hotel run with a professionalism that would grace a very good five-star hotel.

It was simply stunning: high quality local ingredients, simple yet interesting menus and expertly cooked food. That well known Scottish celebrity cook Gordon Ramsay would have struggled to better the quality of food here and he could have learned an enormous amount about true hospitality: all the staff were polite, efficient and unobtrusive.

After a lot of research and also from reading reviews on Trip Advisor, we decided to book An Taigh-Osda. What a beautiful small hotel! There is nothing about it that I can fault. It was warm, clean, cozy, spacious. The place has been very tastefully decorated and a great deal of thought has gone into the finishing touches from the individual bathrobes to the delicious biscuits on the the tea tray in the room! We stayed in 2 of the rooms during our stay (we knew at the time of booking that we would have to move after 3 nights.) Both rooms were facing the loch and both were equally lovely. Actually the room that we moved to on the 4th night was on the top floor and is very comfortable indeed.
