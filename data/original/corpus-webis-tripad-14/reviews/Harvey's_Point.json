Our stay was wonderful; this was a couple of nights away as a kind of mini honeymoon and we were treated like royalty throughout our entire stay. In fact, Sean kept calling me a princess as he took our bags to our penthouse suite!!! Luxurious doesn't begin to describe it. Also, although the hotel was busy judging by the people there for breakfast, when we were in our room we could have been in the hotel alone; it was so quiet and peaceful. We had our dinner in the hotel on our first night there and it was absolutely delicious :) There is everything you could possibly want for breakfast including freshly made omelettes or pancakes with either maple syrup, golden syrup, honey, or grand marnier (!) - I can't think of anything for breakfast that wasn't available... The location is breathtaking and even though it rained a lot we managed to get out for a lovely walk and take some beautiful photos beside the Lough.

Suite itself was amazing - had to warn my husband he could not move in permanently. But details count in a hotel like this and perhaps because it was November we did not feel the service was always seamless. It began with no porter - bit of a surprise. We were there for two nights and the suite was not tidied although a nice man came with cookies and fresh milk. First morning at breakfast my husbands poached eggs - he is a form of torture with his insistence on poached eggs - did not arrive until he was finished his breakfast and then had just been flung on the plate. Second morning hurray beautifully presented poached eggs arrived. On the first night we ate in the bar and enjoyed the food and the service. 2nd night in the restaurant the relaxed attitude became too relaxed to the extent that he was becoming cross and thought we were being ignored. Things improved when our order was finally taken and we enjoyed the food.
