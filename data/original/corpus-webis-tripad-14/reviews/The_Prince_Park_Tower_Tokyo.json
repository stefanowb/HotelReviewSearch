It was clean, nicely decorated and was a surprise after all we had heard about room sizes in Tokyo. A bonus for us was the green offer the hotel operates. One can request that one's room is not serviced (except for rubbish bins) and receive vouchers (2 x 500 yen) to spend in the hotel instead. This service can only be requested two days in a row. Thus if one stays for 7 days, with no service on days 2,3,5 &6, one can receive vouchers to the value of 4000 yen. For budget-conscious travellers, \"earning\" 1000 yen in vouchers (one collects them on the day of no service) allows one to buy treats at the very reasonably priced hotel shop, or other hotel services.

We are from NYC and speak very little Japanese and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We had family in Japan that called the hotel numerous times and once again the staff was very patience and friendly while translating for us. The location is great! Tokyo is so big that I believe it\u2019s hard to be centrally located however this was by subways, buses, etc. So getting around was easy. (Just as the front desk and they can help you with the subway routes.) Rooms were very comfortable. Restaurants at hotel were over priced but I guess that\u2019s what you get for convenience. (Food was very good) The upstairs lounge that over looks the Tokyo Tower was nice however there is a fee to sit at a table. I would suggest checking out the Fish Market. We had a great lunch there that tasted just like our dinner at the hotel the night before at one third of the price. You do have to pay for gym which was about 20 bucks per person for a 24 hour period. So we were able to get to the gym two days in a row for the cost of one day. Just as a FYI, you are not allowed to use the pool/spa facilities with you have any visible tattoos. Husband and I both have some so we were not able to use those facilities which was a bummer, but we respect the culture so we couldn't complain. Overall it was a great hotel for our first visit to Japan.
