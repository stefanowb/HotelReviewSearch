Aloft is a budget hotel, not a full service hotel. Like Marriott offers full service hotels and Courtyards and Fairfield Inns -- Starwood offers St Regis, Westins, Sheratons and at the low end...Aloft. Now, as far as budget hotels go, I like what it has to offer. Clean rooms, a comfortable bed, nice big flatscreen, free wifi, really nice gym and a hip, fun bar. I know they don't have a full service restaurant and don't expect room service. I don't stay at an Aloft to be pampered, I stay there typically to be close to an airport, at a price that is reasonable and for that purpose, it fits the bill and is a better choice for me than a Courtyard, Fairfield Inn or other budget hotel offerings (other than Hampton Inns, which I also like).", "title": "We went first & 4th night open on our trip.
