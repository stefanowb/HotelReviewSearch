The room was confirmed with a credit card. When we arrived at the check on time there was no one there. We had passerbys call her mobile phone and she sent someone to meet us who could hardly speak English. He informed us that they had no room for us. We showed him a copy of her email confirmation to us and then he said wait, called her and then disappeared for almost an hour. He returned to tell us that he had arranged two rooms for us since we would have to switch rooms after the first night. One cost more and one cost less than what we had confirmed and neither had a sea view. Elisabetta never did make a personal appearance. This place was recommended in a very popular guidebook. Beware if you think you are going to have a room when you arrive since we heard that some Cinque Terre operators cancel your reservation when they get a better rate from others.", "user": "Alpenglowtraveler", "date": "October 25, 2007", "id": 10340061}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Beware, resevations are not honored !", "text": "I reserved a room for 3 nights from Elisabetta in May for our September stay.
