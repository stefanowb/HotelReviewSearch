But Amsterdam is so small, you can walk or bike to any where in the city in about 10-20 minutes. The rooms were extremely bare and small. We stayed on the top floor, yet we could hear people walking/talking on our floor and the one below. The walls are paper thin!! We could hear the people in the next room lifting the toliet seat!!! The bathroom was also extremely tiny with a shower that was about 2 feet by 2 feet. When we took a shower the entire bathroom got wet. Also, no air conditioning.
