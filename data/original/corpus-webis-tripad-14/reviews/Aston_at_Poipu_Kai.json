Different units at Poipu Kai are managed by different companies. The best area is Poipu Sands. Units with ocean views (peeks), have closer water views than in the other parts of Poipu Kai and one of the two out of a total of 7 swimming pools that are reasonably sized and accessible only to renters with an appropriate key. Other 6 pools on the property range from foot spas to almost swimmable. Ocean can be rough in winter. Management company for the units moved us in 3 days because they had booking problems. Polite but annoying. We had to firmly request a unit in Poipu Sands that had access to the pool, and a decent view (tho we had confirmed reservations months in advance).", "title": "Kauai the Best No Matter What", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "Cazadero", "date": "April 1, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4827156}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "nice area", "text": "I stayed at the resort from January 25 to Feb 8, 2006 with 3 other friends.
