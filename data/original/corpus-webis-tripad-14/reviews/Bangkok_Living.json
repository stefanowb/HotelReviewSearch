When we arrived we stayed at the usual accommendations of those familiar names of the hotel chain industry, but right from the get go you will feel as if you are in your lux condo in downtown Chicago footsteps from everything! At first I was hesitant from fraying from the regular posh comforts of those other good places, but this place was recommended by my wife\u2019s family who are local in Bangkok, so they know what the best deals local \u201cthai prices\u201d are and where to avoid the hustle all those touristy spots bring to the table. First we stayed at the one bedroom unit. At first entrance of the room you feel the modern posh decor. The refrigerator is one that three times the size of any hotel I\u2019ve been in! There\u2019s a kitchen prep area which is good for microwaving food. The bathroom has good hot water at push of a button. The king bed/ Sealy high end is better than most Asian hotels because it\u2019s not as hard, We had a very good nights sleep! The cabinets to store cloths can stow easy about three weeks of cloths for two people! The room service is 24/7 and you could order from the local fair and eat very good, as well as see great views of from the balcony of the room!Just four blks from the new train system that connects you to everything! And across the street from a bus stop and taxi pickup area. The hotel is family owned so you\u2019re not dealing with people of chain hotels who just need a job this is their passion, life. Come out to see for yourself, it\u2019s only been open for less than one year!", "title": "wow!

There's nothing much I can add to the other reviews - the place is exactly as described - clean, modern, spacious. There's a small kitchenette area with a fair sized frig, a TV with several channels (loved watching the Asian cook shows!), nice big armoire, and - for my purposes - even a clothes drying rack. I liked to wash and rinse my clothes every night since it is hot and dusty in Bangkok, and it was wonderful to be able to spread my wet washed things on the rack and have they dry overnight. One of my concerns was safety, this is a very safe area. I walked to and from the BTS station (3 blocks) at all times of the day or night and always felt safe. The hosts were as described - very friendly and accommodating. The security people were the friendliest and helped with my arrival and departure taxis.
