Rooms had hairdryer, mini-bar, 2 telephones, internet point. Gorgeus bathroom with a power shower and fluffy towels!. We flew to manchester so got the train from the airport to manchester picadilly and the hotel is about a 5min walk from the station if that.

However my biggest gripe (as other reviewers have also noticed) is the staff. At a trendy hotel such as this, you expect young staff who are not only cheery but helpful and friendly. The Mal staff are none of these things. I found them moody, unhelpful and totally disinterested in their customers, just checking people in and out on a rote without any personality. It's a shame, management needs to do something about this, because this hotel has the potential to be great (and at those charges it certainly thinks it is) but, as with many things in this life, it is the human touch that lets it down.", "title": "A bit overpriced for what it is", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Mathewnewman", "date": "September 21, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 5824815, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location", "disliked": "\u2014 Staff"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2006, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed at this hotel on on the 16th September and what can i say.

A short trundle for wheel-based luggage from Piccadilly Station and you're at the Mal - somewhere in the mists between Paris and the 24-hour party city. You cross the chessboard reception and suddenly you're a king for the knight. It's your move. Smoak Bar and Grill at Mal Manchester: A grill room and bar quite unlike anything Manchester has ever before seen. Set in the award-winning Malmaison Hotel minutes from Piccadilly station, Smoak is total indulgence for the senses. The amazing aroma of nation's finest oak-smoked steaks and fresh fish, served to a pewter counter or cosy booth. Imagine great imported beers, cocktails and bubbly served from an unusual sunken bar, with highly skilled mixologists serving you while you stay seated. Picture a stylish relaxed but chic interior a mix of booths, banquettes and counter stools. Come lunchtime and it's locally sourced bread, generously filled sandwiches and salads or full blown grill dining for the more adventurous lunchtime escapee. Come sundown the mood changes and we turn the aromas up to eleven. The cocktails flow, the steaks sizzle, the music turns up and the night begins. Ember Lounge at Mal Manchester: We could tell you about the Ember Lounge - an immaculate and opulent cocktail bar furtively hidden to the rear of the Smoak Bar & Grill."}
