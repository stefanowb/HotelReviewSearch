The food is just awful \u2013 almost inedible for lunch and dinner \u2013 breakfast by far the best, make sure to eat a big first meal. There is absolutely no soundproofing between rooms \u2013 you will hear *everything* your neighbors say/do. Staff is nice and helpful. There\u2019s a small bar downstairs, next to hyena feeding area, where the staff goes and there are few tourists \u2013 check it out. Have lots of small-bill shillings, as you'll need/want to tip all the time. Had amazing game drives.

Elephants and lions were plentiful (lions were easy to spot, since usually there was five cars or so around them...) as well as buffalos. We also saw a lonely rhino, so I think we were lucky... We also saw a carcass taken to a tree by a leopard, so those shy cats were somewhere nearby, too... In addition we saw giraffes, many antilopes (wildebeests etc.), warthogs, ostrichs, zebras and so on. We even saw a lonely hippo, which was quite a surprise, since our guide thought that we are not going to see those unless we drive half a day to Mara river (in addition there was some hippos next to Keekorok lodge, but they live in an artificial pool)... The only bad thing in Mara Sopa, considering game drives, is that you have to leave every time to same direction, and to reach Mara river or any western areas of the park you have the spend much of the day for transfer drives...
