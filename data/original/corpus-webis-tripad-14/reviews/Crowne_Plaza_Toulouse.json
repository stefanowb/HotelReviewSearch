If the buffet breakfast is included in the price of your room, by all means feast on the eggs, meats, and sides of fruit, cereal, and pastries. I did hear that the price was quite high, however, if not included. The club room is very basic but the wines for the afternoon cocktail hour were good. Our room was very clean and very quiet, a plus for a hotel in the midst of things. The front desk staff was friendly and knowledgeable. One of the members of our party who left the day before we did thought that he may have left something in his room and asked my husband to check on it. The front desk was unable to check with the housekeeping staff because it was a holiday but they did follow up the next day, however, and emailed my husband to let him know what they found.
