The location is easy to find but we made some wrong turns and got stuck on some narrow one-way streets. We called the gentleman at the front desk of Hotel Giolli and he was very patient and helpful. I stayed here with my mother, aunt and cousin for 4 nights. My mother and I shared room 306 which had two twin beds. The beds were comfortable, the air conditioning worked well and the bathroom was clean. There was a full tub with a shower head, but, as with most 3 stars in Italy, no shower curtain. Our safe had dead batteries when we arrived but they were replaced before we returned from dinner that night. I was glad that it fit my 13\" laptop. The internet access in the lobby came and went but was free. The breakfast was standard Italian light breakfast with pastries, yogurt, fruit, cappuccino and hard boiled eggs. We were only a few minutes walk to the Repubblica metro stop and just a little farther to the main terminal station. We found the metro very easy to use and affordable. Just before you get to the Repubblica stop walking from the hotel there is a news stand that sells metro and bus tickets. The walk to Trevi fountain was about 10 minutes. The evening concierge recommended a restaurant two blocks away and gave us a coupon for it. The food was great and the service even better. We ate here 2 nights. The building feels nice and secure. There are security guards in a booth as you head up the stairs and he exterior door is closed after 10pm. There is a call button and they buzz you in.", "title": "Great place for a great price!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Rndthewrld", "date": "July 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 70840622}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Carlo!

One day we literally didn't realize that we walked from our hotel to the Vatican to the Spanish steps.... We walked to the Colliseum at night. The only place we didn't walk to were the Castello Romano Outlets (45 min drive) and Naples (1 hour train ride). Now, to get to the point, CARLO!!!!!!!!!!!!! Carlo is the greatest asset that any tourist can have. Every recommendation that he made was absolute perfecto! He was kind, generous with information, and always greeted us with a smile. While staying in Sorrento and Madrid, my girlfriends and I stayed at Hilton Hotels, and I must say that I missed Carlo when we were in those other hotels. The hotel was quaint and the room for 3 was big enough for 3 women to share a bathroom without killing each other :) Thank you Carlo for your hospitality!
