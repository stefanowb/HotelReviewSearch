It was a cold evening when we arrived at a very busy hotel. We were delighted with the genuinely warm welcome! Reception was busy but they had plenty of staff on duty to cope and we got a nice comfortable room. We were a bit concerned that there might be outside noise due to the fully booked hotel but we didn't need worry! Everything was just right, down to the fab photography of the waterford coastline on display in the corridors and the bedrooms, definitely would encourage us to come back to the area to holiday ( if only the sun would shine more!) We got a fab dinner with a great deal for 4 courses and a bottle of wine. The only thing which I would say could do with improvement is that they should install air conditioning, the room was somewhat stuffy and a bit too chilly to open at night since the outside temp. was down to 5C the night we stayed!

The Tower Hotel in Waterford is only three stars, but in my view it doesn\u2019t live up to its rating, either. To begin, when we walked into our room the overhead lights were not on and no switch we threw would light them. So we called the desk and the woman said to put our card-key in the slot. We could\u2019t find a slot so phoned again. Well, maybe there isn\u2019t a slot in that room, just throw the switch. Lady, we\u2019ve thrown all the switches. So she sent up a tech, who eventually decided that the bulbs in both overhead lights were burned out. About half or three-quarters of an hour later, he showed up with a ladder and bulbs.
