It is clean, modern, safe, beautiful, convenient (you can walk to the airport), and very chic. Still the prices are reasonable. There is late check in and check out. My only problem was with the breakfast. We were told that breakfast was included in the price and we could eat until noon. When we went to the hotel restaurant at 11:30 am, we were seated and brought menus. When my girlfriend asked why we needed the menus when the buffet would be included, the manager said we had to go to the restaurant at the top floor and not the one we were at (they could have said that when we entered the restaurant telling them we were there for our free breakfast--instead they tried to see if they could trick us into paying--but then again in Mexico in general everyone tries to see how much money they can get out of you). When we went to the restaurant at the top floor, they said breakfast was over at 11 am. This kind of miscommunication (having been told breakfast is available till noon when it is only available till 11 am) was unacceptable for a hotel such as Camino Real. Other than that glitch, we were happy.

The only disappointment was the night we stayed the room service wasn't available due to a problem with the gas in the kitchen. There are plenty of fast food outlets and a couple of restaurants at the airport though, it was just unfortunate that we wanted room service that night in particular.
