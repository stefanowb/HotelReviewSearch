Although we felt bad having to check out early, I saw another bug and couldn't stay there comfortably. The place needs updating and a thorough bath (there were dust mites all over the fake flowers in the hallway). However, I must say that Jane and Rocky were very understanding and only charged us the one night for the room. I am just a freak about bugs, but apparently, they are all over Savannah.

At a B&B we expect the breakfast to be a special experience or at least an abundant buffet so people with varying tastes and restrictions could be satisfied, but both mornings a handful of dishes were put out, including a bowl of grits and some Southern (greasy) meat. One of the days there was a small quiche-type casserole, which was good but too small to feed all the guests. The cook was willing to prepare eggs on request but they were swimming in butter or some other fat. The bread one day was refrigerator-type rolls with sickly sweet icing and the other day cold, toasted commercial cinnamon bread. There were a few boxed cereals plus sweet homemade granola. But the nail in the coffin was canned fruit. Why, in this day of always accessible sweet fresh pineapple, a B&B charging $200/night would serve canned pineapple rings is beyond me.
