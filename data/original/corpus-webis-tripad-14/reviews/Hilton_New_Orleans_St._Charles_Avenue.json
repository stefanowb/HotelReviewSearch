Unless you are still in college, Bourbon street is a walk through and not a place to spend the night. There is so much more to NO. Staying in the downtown area lets you explore the entire city. This hotel is surrounded by fantastic restaurants and outdoor music venues. The best part is really the staff, made up of the nicest and most accommodating people. That being said, the hotel is really more of a three star. Clean, but very outdated and smelled heavily of cigarette smoke. Also, there is nothing to do here, with the exception of the attached restaurant. It's a very basic, no thrills kinda place. Strangely, there is a pool in the basement, but I really didn't see the point of using an indoor pool when the weather was so beautiful outdoors.", "title": "Nice staff, average hotel", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "danidef", "date": "January 29, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 123809917}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My wife and I stayed here from New Year's Eve through January 3.

This property is just a short 3 blocks or so to Canal Street and the French Quarter. Was very quiet at night. Also, a nice outdoor observation deck/patio on the 18th floor.

Everyone was incredibly helpful and friendly and made us feel at home. We received an upgrade to the executive floor, which was a nice bonus.
