Margo and Donie are fantastic hosts and made our stay very enjoyable. We truly felt like we were welcome guests in their home. The house is away from the city center, which makes for quiet nights and great sleeping. Margo showed where we could park for free in town. Our room was clean and comfortable. The breakfasts were great. With Donie providing the entertainment our days always started out on the right note. A couple of reviewers have mentioned a problem with the wifi connection. I experienced a problem, too, but Margo took the time to check it out and I was able to get connected with her help. We were totally satisfied with our stay and would definitely stay at Landfall House again if we return to Kinsale.", "title": "Wonderful stay in Kinsale", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jab31151", "date": "August 20, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 173200166}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "I recently stayed here with my girlfriend whilst on a 3-day trip to Cork.

Donie, our host, was a delightful man with a great sense of humor (and very \"Irish\"), who greeted us when we came in. After we settled in, he kindly gave us a ride back into town, after we had gotten somewhat lost navigating our car, to Landfall. He pointed to navigational highlights along the way, while giving humorous antidotes about local attractions, so it was easy to walk back following our dinner. The breakfast the next morning was very nice, prepared and served by Donie and his wife, Margo, who also was also outgoing and helpful about local sites and highlights along the route we would be taking to our next destination.
