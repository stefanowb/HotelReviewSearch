Nice size room with half wall that had sofa/coffee table desk etc. Some of the furniture was well worn. Was told the hotel was 6 years old and had been recently remodeled. Rooms did have microwave, coffee pot, and refrigerator.

There was cereal, prepackaged muffins, bagels and waffles. The waffle mix hadn't been stirred well enough before it was put in the dispenser and had lumps of flour all in it. They weren't edible. The microwave must have been 20 years old. Apple juice dispenser didn't have apple juice in it, I think it must have been water.", "title": "Loved it!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "solgirlDallas", "date": "February 6, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 4417739}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Will never again", "text": "I must say that I was leary after reading some of the reviews, but it was great!!

The staff was very gracious and helpful. The bed was uncomfortable but the pillows were great; linens were adequate but nothing more; TV worked but was small and had limited channels; wifi was good and free.
