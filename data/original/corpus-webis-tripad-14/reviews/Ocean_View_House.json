We all loved Staithes - a lovely little village with some cute little shops and the kind of ambiance that makes you not want to leave. the property looked amazing from the photo's and expectations were high when we arrived. We found the property easily but due to the location and the facilities in the town the car park is about 1km from the property - which was OK and out of the control of the owner. I take my hat off to the owner as they have tried really hard to make this into a wonderful little cottage but the problem was just that...its very small and sold as sleeping 8-10.....There are 3 bedrooms, 1 bed in the living room and 2 beds in the basement....off the shower and Sauna. Whilst we were there 2 of the showers weren't working, the dishwasher wasn't working and the boiler was temperamental and the caretaker was very slow to respond to our requests meaning that 2 of our party had to bath their 6 month old in the basement shower as it was the only room where the shower worked, we had to continually wash and dry up as there was no drying rack for the plates and the dining room - which has a stunning view - barely fit us all in with the furniture that was in there.", "title": "Should have been brilliant - didn't quite live up to our expectations", "user": "busastep", "date": "November 5, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 10609135}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 2, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Ocean View House Staithes, Yorkshire", "slim_ranking": 1.0}
