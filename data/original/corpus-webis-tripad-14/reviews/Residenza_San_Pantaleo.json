Our room was modest but comfortable, it was clean and overlooked a quiet courtyard, and the price -- 100 Euro -- was right. I would recommend this hotel. I'm just not aware of the varying sizes of the rooms.

I was a little weary of this accommodation since I had only read one review, but this residence turned out to be my favorite in Rome. Our room was spotlessly clean, we had a big room with a bid bed and a nice little view. I can't even begin to explain the location! We were just a two minutes walk to Piazza Navona, and an easy walk to many other of Romes highlights, and the Vatican. You must stay here if you are looking for a quiet, clean, helpful hotel at a great price.

The location can't be beat for the price - you are 1 block away from P. Navonna, a few blocks away from Pantheon, Campo di Fiori, and walking distance to Trevi Fountain, and almost anything else. Breakfast is at a nice cafe/bar across the street. Room that we had was very small, small bathroom, but just enough room for the minimum amount of time you spend there. Good firm mattress, A/C worked well. But due to the setup - it is as if you have rooms in someone's large apartment, you get a lot of hallway noise, from people and manager coming and going, though surprising not a lot of outside noise considering location.
