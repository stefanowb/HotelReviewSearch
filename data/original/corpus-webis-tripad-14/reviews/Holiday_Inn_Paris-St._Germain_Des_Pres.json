The checkin was prompt and efficient. Even checking in early in the morning after the trans Atlantic flight, our room was ready. We had reserved a deluxe room. It was large for European hotel rooms. The furnishings were just fine, nothing fancy, but nothing bad either; really typical of Holiday Inn. The bathroom was large and nice. The high speed internet worked just great. The location is great, subway stop 1/2 block away and train station only about a 10 min walk. Several good restaurants within easy walking distance. Our room rate included breakfast in the hotel and it was great. The staff were friendly, spoke good English and were very helpful.
