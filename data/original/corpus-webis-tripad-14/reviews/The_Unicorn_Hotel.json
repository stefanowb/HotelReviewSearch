However, when booking the hotel with booking.com we requested a quiet room away from the road and kept our fingers crossed. We were not disappointed. We had a charming room (Room 19) tucked away at the end of a corridor, up quiet a few steps! but overlooking the garden area and Church. It wasn't the biggest room we have ever had, but it was in keeping with the hotel - and just what we'd hoped for. Reception check-in was welcoming and the lounge/bar/restaurant areas were lovely. We did not dine in the hotel in the evening (we chose to eat at the White Hart on the square - which was great), and got back to the hotel looking forward to a good night's sleep. This was not the case and was NO fault of the hotel. The church which is right next door to the hotel, rang it's bells every 15 minutes and continued right through the night. If it hadnt been for the church - we would have had a lovely/comfortable sleep. We haven't noticed any other reviews concerning the church noise and don't know whether this was a one-off, but it would make us think twice about staying here again.

If you had the window open it was unbearable as the room was facing right on to the main road and our window was just above the traffic lights so we had to keep the window closed all week-end which was not good as it was a hot sunny weekend when we stayed here. The breakfast was not as good as it could have been and certainly we have had better and paid a lot less for it.
