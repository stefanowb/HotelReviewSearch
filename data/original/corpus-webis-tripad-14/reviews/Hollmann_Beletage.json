Really pleased on our hotel choice which can make or break any vacation. Let me start by saying that home away from home is a accurate description. The staff could not have been nicer and more helpful from reserving for dinners & lunches, Orchestra tickets, manicures, buckets of ice (we americans love our frozen water) right down to Andrea purchasing a hair flat iron/ curling Iron for me so I did not need to worry about bringing one from home. Every detail and request was met with a sincere desire to help us with whatever our needs were. All of the ladies and gentlemen that were attending the desk were simply lovely. Joseph the chef made us the most amazing surprises for breakfasts and little treats and even came to our room very early on the morning of our departure to bring us a nice picnic lunch for us to take with us. How thoughtful! The lovely girls in the dining would happily bring to our room wonderful coffee and croissants on the mornings that we just moving slow and not in need of a full breakfast. Housekeeping was very kind and patient on the days that we were slow on getting out for the day or days that we just stayed in to read and relax. With our stay be a long one we were guided on what would be the best room to suit us (#5) was perfect, nice view, very spacious, huge closets, separate couch area for my husband the night owl to read without disturbing my slumber. the only minor thing with that room that some may want to consider is that it is directly off of the living room lounge area and at some time in the morning you could hear the kitchen/dining going on. For us that location was not an issue and actually we found it very convenient to just open the door and hang our by the little fireplace and sip a nice drink from the honor bar and also to skip easily into the kitchen for that extra coffee serving or juice. Location, we walked everyday, everywhere and it was perfectly located for visiting all of the sights, restaurants, shopping all just outside the door. Directly across is a small grocer which was terrific for picking up snacks, wine ect. Value galore! We usually splurge on our trips and tend to go for 4 star plus hotels, this had the 5 star experience for us at 1/2 of what we normally spend. The interesting details in decor are fun,whimsical and very easy to feel comfortable and relax without the stuffy feeling that have had at other European hotels that we have stayed at. I read somewhere the towels are a little crunchy, I am all in favor of eco savings for quick dry towels and the nice robe and slippers made up for that silly little thing some may find less than perfect. Don't think twice if you enjoy boutique/funky hotels in fantastic location with just the perfect amount of twistedness that i find charming. thanks to all of you at the Hollmann Beletage for making our stay a very memorable one!

Surrounded by the historic buildings of Vienna's inner city, the Hollmann Beletage is a small boutique hotel offering modern convenience and elegance in an exceptionally central location!!! Everything sparkled there including smiling staff who was working there and the cleanliness of the hotel. Fantastic location, excellent service and the best room I have ever had! It was a huge, very posh, hight selling, beautiful queen's size bed with lots of soft cushions, fantastic bath and spa room and a useful kitchen!!! We didn't really use the kitchen, but it was nice to have a coffee in the room when we want it without needing to go out. We had a breakfast in our room. Two beautiful ladies, wearing national austrian dresses, brought it to us. We could choose everything we want. Everything was very fresh and testy and it was more than enough. I felt like a queen there! We could also use an ipad which was very useful for my boys and myself. I will highly recommend this hotel and the Luxury Suite!
