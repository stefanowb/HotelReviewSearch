Smartly configured, practically appointed, and VERY clean and comfortable. Incredibly strong shower pressure- a delight when you arrive after midnight after a long day of travel, and all you want is to feel fresh and clean again so that you can sleep and travel again too soon. And you sleep very well here. Comfortable bed and clean pillow, sheet, blanket. Amenities even provided. What more do you need? A/C works, as do TV and blowdrier, all this for such a reasonable price (less than $80 for one person, a little more for a double). Hotel provides a shuttle to the airport with frequent service. I had to take a taxi from Haneda TO the hotel because I arrived at 100am- last shuttles run around 10:00pm. Cost of taxi - a very reasonable 1250 yen. Breakfast and coffee served on premises- and vending machines offer a variety cold drinks, including Asahi beer. Free internet in the lobby, with many comfortable chairs and tables to wait for the shuttle or your friends. Also, hotel staff kindly, expertly, practically and professionally store your luggage for you free of charge- pretty much a necessity since check out is at an early 10:00 a.m. Two minute walk to the subway- Otori station- direct shot to Asakusa area (but not every train is direct). Lovely little bakery on the street entrance to the subway. A Seven- Eleven just across the street, too.

Contrary to the other post, I smelt nothing. Perhaps because I always stay at a non-smoking room. In the non-smoking rooms, I had no problem with the cleanliness. The room are designed small to minimize price- if you want a larger and better room, please stay at Excel Tokyu in Haneda. It's a bit unfair to complain about room size, this is Japan, Tokyo, and a Toyoko Inn. It is cheaper than a Holiday Inn in New York, cleaner and more comfortable, although the room might be a little smaller. This hotel is good enough to take a shower, perhaps a bath, for a clean toilet, comfortable enough nap, a coffee and light breakfast before you depart for another location. It does its job.
