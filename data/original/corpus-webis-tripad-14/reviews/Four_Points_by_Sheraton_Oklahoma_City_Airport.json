And then I read the reviews and seriously considered just taking the loss and getting a different hotel. But, we didn't and we are here for four nights. We checked in on the 4th of July. The front desk agent, Erica, was very pleasant. Although the hotel is basically empty we were assigned a room at the far corner of the hotel. I wonder if this room is reserved for people who reserve through Hotwire or another discount website. Anyway, the room is the first one in from the door at the remote corner of he hotel. As far from he front desk as you can get. The hotel is located at t he airport and is a distance from everything. Since we stay in okc with regularity we knew were to go to get things that we would need. There is a microwave and a refrigerator in the room so that is convenient. The room is clean and although the bathroom is a bit small it is ok. Overall, the hotel is not as bad as I had feared, but there is no way I would call it a three star hotel.
