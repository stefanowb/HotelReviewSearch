I'd prefer those rooms with a pretty view of this capetown landmark with it's colourful houses and the pretty pool deck, while the table mountain is best seen from a longer distance like e.g. the waterfront. rooms have a safe, flatscreen tv, coffee-/tea facilities, bathroom amenities, desk, non sensored mini bar and they are really large. I can also recommend room service (e.g. yummy cheeseburgers) which is not expensive. the parking garage underneath the hotel is safe and costs 90rand a day. when driving in and out frequently, check the reception to activate your room key(-card) which then can be used for getting out (out only). the heated saltwater pool area is just fantastic in summertime. this would always be the reason for me to choose the hilton instead of other hotels of it's class (e.g. westin). overall no major faults at this hilton and you can't go wrong here, however ask for an invoice preview before checking out. I found some mini bar items on there which we did'nt use. capetown area is fantastic, but you will not do without a rental car from the moment you'll arrive. enjoy.", "title": "outdoor pooldeck for the summer season", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "griswolds09", "date": "March 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 125581004}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The new Hilton in Cape Town is fresh, clean, elegant and stylish.

It's a bit like a long, narrow bowling lane - separated by four odd room dividers. It really messed up our facilitation plan.
