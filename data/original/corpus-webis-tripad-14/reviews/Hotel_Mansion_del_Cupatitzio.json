One of the main attractions in this city is the Parque Nacional Eduardo Ruiz which is located a few feet from the entrance to the hotel. The park follows the headwaters of the Rio Cupatitzio which are entirely within city of Uruapan. It is a breathtaking tropical paradise which must be seen to be believed. The hotel is well run, clean and comfortable with lovely grounds and a friendly, attentive staff. Across the street, with a view into the park is an excellent restaurant specializing in the local trout. We found it to have better food and service than the acceptable hotel dining room. Uruapan is also the avocado capital of the world so they are served at virtually every meal. If you are traveling to this area you will enjoy Mansion del Cupatitzio.", "title": "Great location, lovely grounds", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "EB3", "date": "May 14, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 5068167}], "location": {"country": "Mexico", "region": "Central Mexico and Gulf Coast"}, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 0, "very good": 13, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 14}, "aka": "Hotel Mansion Del Cupatitzio Uruapan, Mexico - Michoacan", "slim_ranking": 0.3}
