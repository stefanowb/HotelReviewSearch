At least for that money I expected 5 star luxury but I was a bit disapointed. It was close but not quite there. Front desk staff were uninterested and did not smile which got me off to a bad start. They then told me that the spa and leisure facilities were free which was a bit cheeky considering what I was paying for the room. The lobby is luxurious and the rooms very smart - but not outstanding. There were 5 peaches in the room. One was hard, one was mouldy, one was over ripe and only two were good.
