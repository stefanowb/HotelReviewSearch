We stayed in the Don Quijote apartment, which was comfortable, although the bed was a double rather than a king as advertised, and the ventilation system means that noise is constantly coming down from the main house. When this is classical music, it's wonderful; however, when it's the sound of construction every single morning from 9am onward... The website is very much out of date, and the owners need to make clear to their paying guests that the house is not yet finished. On a related note, in the summertime at least, the house seems to be largely occupied by the owners and their family -- while you couldn't ask for a nicer family, this does create a different environment than the one suggested by the website, which gives the impression of self-contained suites, whereas this is much closer to a homestay (without meals). That being said, the atmosphere is very congenial, and the house is very convenient for everything in beautiful Guanajuato.", "title": "Lovely house, but closer to a homestay, and still under construction", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "trilceana", "date": "August 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 18724804, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location & innkeeper", "disliked": "\u2014 Construction"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a newly remodeled hacienda in town and just a few blocks from the wonderful Plaza Jardin.
