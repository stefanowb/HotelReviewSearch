Our room was not large, but well decorated with a large (king) bed, a TV, a fridge, an arm chair. There was also a coffee/tea maker with Starbucks coffee, hot cocoa, and tea. The bathroom was spacious with two-people shower, a skylight, his and hers sinks and Aveda toiletries. Breakfast was plentiful -- eggs, breads, yogurt, fruit, juices, oatmeal, cereal, sweet baked goods, tea, and coffee. Everyone was friendly and dinner recommendations were right on the money.

From the moment we arrived we realized why others had raved about the San Luis Creek. We booked the Bed in Breakfast in Bed special which came with a bottle of wine from a nearby winery. It was chilled and waiting for us when we checked in. We opted to eat in the carriage house both days and breakfast was fantastic! There were many options available and gratis Starbucks to go, which helped as the tours were early in the morning and we had to drive a bit to get there. The rooms are spacious and wonderfully appointed. The four poster bed and fireplace made for a romantic weekend for two very grateful adults. Because it is set up more like a boutique hotel with B&B benefits, we never felt like we were possibly disturbing the proprietors and/or guests at any time.

We called and got a small discount for a lovely king room in the Londonderry building, with a fireplace. That room was very tiny, but still nicely furnished. The beds are all wonderfully comfortable and have down comforters. The breakfast is above average, and includes hot eggs of some sort and/or quiche. The dining area is small, but since it's a small lodge, it wasn't very crowded. It's too bad they don't have more land to work with, because the only thing missing is luxurious landscaping and a pool to lounge by. But then, of course, they'd be charging double! The rooms really do feel like you are at an exclusive resort somewhere. I think it's a perfect place for exploring the area and then sleeping in comfort.

DVDs could be rented from the reception area and an ice machine, a very funny one is right besides reception entrance.Breakfast which was included was a huge plus and consisted of very delicious home-made cakes,the lady asked me if i wanted omelettes or something in the morning which she was willing to prepare, fresh fruit, milk, starbucks filtered coffee and very delicious Granola (cereals) which could be mixed with the nuts provided too.
