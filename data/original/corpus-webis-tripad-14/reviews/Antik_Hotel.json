Breakfast is served in the roof cafe and is substantial and very interesting although not your classic American bacon and eggs affair. Similarly there is a happy hour up there in the late afternoon where local beers and wines are half price - quite a nice way to finish the day with a cold drink and a view over the sea. The only down side I can think of with this hotel was that the air conditioning in the room did struggle a bit.

This was a good choice. The Antik is just off the busy tram street and is on a quieter side street but in close proximity to the Grand Bazaar and not a long walk at all down to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Cistern and other great sites in the Old City. The tram stops (either Beyazit or Laelli) are easy to get to. The hotel was comfortable and the staff was helpful and gracious. A highlight was the rooftop dining area for breakfast or dinner. Also for drinks (half price for Turkish wine or beer in May..) between 5 and 7 p.m. Great views out over the ever-busy sea of Marmara. The standard rooms are compact but certainly adequate, and if you are staying for several days or want a bit more space consider upgrading to a junior suite. Breakfast was excellent (included in the rate) with lots of Turkish cheeses, a good selection of breads, cereals, veggies, olives, yoghurts, and more. There was a small selection of hot breakfast items every day such as scrambled eggs or Turkish-style eggs with tomatoes and onions. Coffee was good. If you are looking for a moderately priced, central four star in the Old City I would definitely recommend the Antik Hotel.", "title": "Istanbul visit May 2012 - from Italy", "user": "Danto12", "date": "May 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130690033}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We spent a week at the Antik hotel in July 2011 .

First, we walked in and we were not greeted by anyone at all. We walked up to front desk to check in and the girl at the front desk ( Neriman was her name) and again she didn't greet, her first words to us were \"passports\". My husband handed her his passport and credit card and her response was, I didn't ask you for a credit card. Her tone was rude and condescending to say the least. When booking reservation, we indicated that we were arriving at noon and would need an early checkin. They had our reservation completely wrong, not only did they want us to wait two hours for room but they also didn't have the room we requested available. We had two rooms reserved, one for myself, my husband and two children (ages 2 and 4) and one room for my in-laws. The room that was intended for myself, husband and kids was the one not available and they wanted us to take a room with two single beds (twin size beds). The manager was very nonchalant and rude and basically said that is what is was and we could take it or leave it. My husband was furious and ended up having an arguement with front desk manager. After contacting our travel agency and hotel manager they apologized and immediately upgraded us to a suite. The room and hotel itself was nicely decorated and very cool for the historical aspects within the actual facility but the customer service was nonexistent. So with the check-in behind us, we get to the room which was spacious and clean however the room was so HOT! Apparently there is central heat and air but it is controlled by the front office and they were running the heat. The day we arrived it was 18 degrees celcius (about 64 farenheit) The thermometer in the hallway read 29 degrees celcius (84 farenheit) so I can only imagine what our actual room temperature was!
