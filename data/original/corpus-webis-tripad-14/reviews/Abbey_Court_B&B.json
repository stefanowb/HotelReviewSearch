Bren and Ger seemed like old friends with their interest in us and our actviities. The four of us stayed in 2 rooms that could be closed off to make a suite. We were unfortunate to be visiting the area in cold, rainy 'summer' weather and were delighted that Brendan helped us dry our clothes! The location was ideal for traveling around Kerry. In the 3 nights we were there we felt comforted at the end of a days journey to return to this house. From the house, you can easily walk to town for dinner or a drink. Kenmare is the perfect size for walking around to shop and find a good resturant. I would stay there again!

There was lots of choice of cereals and fresh fruit although it was in containers as it was bought from the supermarket think they could present it a little better.

It is walking distance to downtown and located on a beautiful lake which provides lots of peace and quiet. The landscaping is beautiful, the kitchen/living area are beautifully decorated and artwork is hung all around. We only saw one owner who was very friendly and the breakfast was okay. Basic cereal, cheese, fruit and an Irish Breakfast. My only problem, and it was a big one, was the bedroom linens were terrible! They were old and dirty looking. I'm sure they were washed but they were just so old looking that I'm not sure how clean they could actually get them. The sheets were paper thin and I'm glad I brought my own pillow. The bathroom was outdated but it was clean and the shower had great water pressure (which no other place in Ireland did!). I would not stay in Abbey Court again unless they invested in some quality towels and bed linens.

They serve the best breakfasts in the world! Choice of cheeses, cereals etc has to be seen to be believed. The owners are the friendliest people in Ireland, and NOTHING is too much trouble for them. They loaned us maps and spent ages drawing pictures helping us to find our way around. I cannot say enough good things about this B&B. Everyone i met agreed. They served a tray with drinks and biscuits to you EVERY TIME you returned - not just on arrival (this was the only B&B we stayed in that served that AT ALL!) The rooms are fantastic. The views are unreal!! Outside area for guest use . . incredible guest lounge rooms, and dining room! What else can i say? This is a spectacular, not to be missed B&B.

Family friendly, close to town, golfing, sightseeing, etc., this was a great two-night stay for us. The hosts, Brendan and Geraldine, made us feel very welcome as soon as we arrived, offering to \"put a kettle on\" for us to have a cup of afternoon tea. The property has a beautiful view of the bay from the upstairs bedroom windows, two sitting rooms, a large backyard area for kids to play, and more than adequate parking spaces (which was unusual for the B&Bs we stayed at in Ireland). The walk into town is advertised as 10 minutes, but that would be a brisk walk if not a jog. Its actually more like 15 minutes, but there is a sidewalk the whole way, and it is a pleasant walk past some interesting houses. There are plenty of pubs and restaurants in Kenmare to satisfy just about any taste. The friendliest we found were Ryans and O'Donnabahains (spelling might not be correct on that one!), both of which offered friendly service. Ryans only does sandwiches, but offers traditional Irish pub music in the evenings most nights. O'Donnabahains offers a full menu of very tasty food, including take-away (which is not that common in town).
