This is also a good place for tennis players - the resort does a nice job of creating a little tennis \"community\". The beach is nice, clean, never had to fight for a chair, and the resort's towl-service was excellent. The resort is located at the southern end of the Hotel Zone so while the water was ok about half the time, sometimes it collected a fair amount of seaweed and other stuff especially so when it was windy. RE: other stuff - apparently during our stay a shark attacked and killed somebody up north and a disembodied leg was found by a Club Med snorkeler (btw - the snorkeling is decent at the resort, a few reefs to check out) which brought out La Policia. It was a little unnerving to lay on the beach that day around a few guys shouldering Uzi sub-machine guns but let's be honest - this isn't the U.S. and shark attacks DO occur. I was in the fitness center most days and it's adequate and they do offer some yoga classes and other stuff for those inclined that way. Lastly, they have some decent live music outdoors at night and about half their shows are good but note - everything repeats so if you stay longer than a week you will see the same stuff again.", "user": "bdore", "date": "December 31, 2007", "id": 12164599}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Best place to stay in cancun", "text": "The main negative of the resort is that while it has one main nice-looking pool, it is not a heated pool and was freezing every day - far colder than the ocean. It definitely defeats the purpose of having a nice pool on the property so if you're going for the pool - go elsewhere is my advice. Another big negative are the kids. If you're an early-riser like myself they won't bother you but if you expect to sleep past ~7:30am - forget about it since the kids start running the halls like little beasties about that time (although for families - the Kids Camp during the day does appear to give parents a break). There are three restuarants and the food is wildly inconsistent day-to-day. You'll always find something to eat but nothing resembles fine-dining in terms of food quality... ambiance perhaps at the two reservations-required restaurants but only if parents don't allow their kids to run wild at dinner (it happens).", "user": "catat", "date": "December 30, 2007", "id": 12101292}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Excellent in every respect--the best all inclusive we've been to by far", "text": "The standard rooms at the resort are ok. My mother had one facing the ocean and I had one facing the swamplike, bayish waters (a large alligator lives in those waters). The beds were the best to report of the rooms - firm but not sooo firm plus they had quality linens. The rooms were cold with the AC on and too musty with it off. The standard rooms can be quite dangerous because the bed is only a few feet from a railing and steps down to the fridge, coffee-maker and balcony/patio. One night an elderly gentleman staying at the resort got out of bed and tripped down these stairs, smashed his face up (requiring plentiful stitching at the Cancun hospital - yikes!) and suffered a concussion. We met his son and daughter (both my age) and felt badly for him/them. Two of the eight days we were there the resort suffered brown-outs and one of those days a very large waterbug appeared in my bathroom, I killed it and didn't complain - again - this is Mexico. My advice - keep the AC on even though it gets cold. One minor annoyance was that the toilet was housed separately from the main bathroom - probably an old European vestige or something but I like to wash my hands immediately before touching anything else.", "user": "Scene2woman", "date": "December 29, 2007", "id": 12051123}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Facility, Great GOs.
