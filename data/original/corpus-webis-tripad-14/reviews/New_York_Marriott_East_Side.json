We were on the 25th floor and had a real city view (Waldorf Astoria just a stone throw away). The staff were great - very friendly and helpful. As soon as we checked in the staff took care of everything and the Porter arrived with our bags within seconds. He was really bubbly and gave us a lot of good advice (all of which turned out to be spot on!) - like where to go for the 4th July fireworks, how to get to places and the best times to be there.
