As we where looking for a place with a full kitchen, the Marriott had the best price compared to some of the other resorts in the Muskoka's. The hotel is very clean and modern, breakfast was awesome with make your own waffles , eggs, sausage. hash browns and lots of fruit, cereal and yes included with the price. The room was also spotless and modern , stainless steel appliances. gas fireplace and balcony overlooking the bay. The kitchen comes in handy, if you're like us and like to save money by cooking your own meals sometimes. The only draw back was there was no oven and I would think a full kitchen means an oven as well. So instead of Pizza in the oven, we had pork loin on the BBQ downstairs and it came out great. I would say we had 1 of the 2 best views in the hotel, room 512(ours) and 514 have the best views, remember the higher up on the floors, the better the view.
