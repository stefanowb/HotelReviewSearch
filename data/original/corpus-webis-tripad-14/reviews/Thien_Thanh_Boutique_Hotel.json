We had booked the room a few moths before our trip and had emailed the hotel two days before our arrival to confirm we would get the type of room we requested and paid for. We also arranged, through the hotel, for a driver to pick us up from Da Nang Airport ($12). The driver was waiting for us upon our arrival and got us to the Thien Thanh without any problem. It was when we arrived at the Thien Thanh that we had our first and only major annoyance/problem. We had booked a room with a balcony and view over the rice fields at the rear of the hotel. We arrived and were greeted somewhat coldly by the woman at the front desk. No big deal, we're not sensitive. However, when we were shown to our room it was a dark room with no balcony, one small window, and overlooking the dusty street at the front of the hotel. I hate having to confront hotel staff when tired after being up since 4AM but this was a room I knew was a step lower and cheaper than the one we booked. After going back down to the front desk and telling the desk manager about the discrepancy she gave us another room which had 2 twin beds instead of the full bed we booked, all the while maintaining her cold demeanor. The hotel rest of the staff also seemed slightly indifferent but not outwardly rude. Overall, our stay was pleasant and we met the hotel owner, who was very friendly. Between our stays in Hanoi and HCMC I would say that the hotel staff at the Thien Thanh was the least pleasant. Staff in HCMC and Hanoi were so much friendlier. I have no idea why. Beside our initial check in experience and the indifference of the staff we found the hotel to be well appointed with rooms and balconies overlooking quiet rice fields. Breakfast was included and the banana pancakes were awesome. If it weren't for that initial check-in experience and the untrained staff this hotel would have rated a lot higher.", "title": "Just OK (Polite Staff Could Have Made It Better)", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CalTraveler45", "date": "July 26, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 2.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 18260783}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Thien Than Hotel last April and we enjoyed our stay very much.
