Both suites were clean at check-in and were made-up very well each day of our stay. All staff we came into contact with was very nice. Noise at night was a little loud, but we're sure it's like that pretty much anywhere in Vegas with people coming and going at all times. We liked that it was attached to the Miracle Mall for easy shopping and dining. We liked Ocean One Bar and Grill for breakfast...reasonable prices and great food.

We've stayed at the PH Towers Westgate before, and LOVED it - so when we were able to get a great deal a few months ago we excitedly booked there again. A few weeks prior to our trip, I noticed (while checking Tripadvisor reviews, ironically enough) that the hotel was now called Elara and that it was now a Hilton hotel. I phoned right away to ensure that nothing would change with our reservation - the person I spoke with assured me that it wouldn't, and that everything would be the same as it was when it was a Westgate property. It wasn't. Well, the building itself was exactly the same - the ONLY physical changes since it's become a Hilton is the exterior signage and the removal of the little 'PH Towers' pillows on the bed. Nothing has been overhauled - even though in many places it's necessary - and there are still several places where 'PH Towers' still exists i.e. the gift shop bags, the sign inside each room door.....Even though the pool was in fabulous shape, we weren't allowed to USE it because of a 'grand-opening celebration' (we're not exactly sure what there is to celebrate in a situation where a hotel hasn't been revamped or improved in any way). We found this out from a letter stuck in our door the morning after our arrival, instead of from an actual person when we checked in, which is incredibly poor customer service - and a really bad start for a company trying to keep previous customers after a take-over. We were told that we could use the Planet Hollywood pool instead, but if you're familiar with the strip you know that it's a bit of a trek (a 13-minute walk - we timed it) to get from PH Towers to the Planet Hollywood pool - a complete pain in the a$s if you already have a perfectly fabulous pool in your own hotel. Then, on the night of the grand-opening celebration, all of the hotel guests were deviated from the usual lobby route to another floor/other elevators if they wanted to get anywhere, which was also an imposition when you're on vacation and want things to be smooth and relaxing. One other interesting piece is that when we checked in, the front desk employee took the $20 I gave him for an upgrade, yet didn't upgrade us. We had the same room we had booked in the first place! (so why didn't he just tell me that he couldn't help us out, and let me keep the $20?) WE WILL NEVER STAY AT ELARA AGAIN.

To our dismay, the pool was closed, we were escorted thru a side door and side elevators to our room. We found this to be very demeaning to the people on vacation. We were leaving Las Vegas last night and had planned to sit at the pool in the early afternoon. We were told that we should have received a notice about the \"party for the executives\" which we did not. In talking with other people, they did not receive any notice either. I think the executives should have used the side elevators and the pool should have remained open for everyone.

First I'd like to add a little credibility to my review by stating I've stayed at over ten Las Vegas hotels (all strip hotels minus the HR) and never once have I experienced such terrible service and ridiculous policies. I'm also a timeshare owner (thank god it's not Hilton) and have stayed at other vacation ownership properties. I strongly urge anyone considering a stay here to book elsewhere.", "title": "For the price it was very nice!", "user": "Mariah04", "date": "March 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 126778400}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I just stayed at Elara for the second time. On our first visit, and when we booked this trip, it was called PH Towers, but the ownership changed after we booked the trip. We got a great deal that included an upgrade to a suite--definitely the way to go! The room was enormous, with 5 TVs, a jacuzzi in the room, and a large kitchen. The hotel is located center-Strip (great for if you don't rent a car), very close to City Center, Bellagio, Paris/Ballys, Trop, and MGM. It's a short walk through the Miracle Mile shops to get to the Strip, which I actually prefer over having to navigate through a huge, smokey casino like you do at most hotels. These hotels (PH/Elara) cater to a younger crowd--seemed like most people here and in the casino were mid 20's-30's--and the restaurants/shopping were all more reasonably priced than other mid-Strip casinos like Aria and Bellagio. No trouble checking in early or checking out late, and excellent room service. We would definitely stay here again, especially if we get another good online deal.", "title": "Excellent rooms, value, and location", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "LGinMD", "date": "March 27, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 126758972}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2012, traveled solo", "text": "Stayed at the Elara last week.
