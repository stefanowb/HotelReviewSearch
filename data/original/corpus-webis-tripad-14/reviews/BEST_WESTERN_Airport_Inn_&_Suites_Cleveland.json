It was clean and comfortable, but no frills. The hotel is in a bit of a shady area, but it was easy to get to from various major roadways, very close to the airport, and had adequate parking. It seems the hotel was recently renovated, and our room was decent. The hallways smelled like smoke, but the room didn't. There were some cigarette stains on the bathroom countertop, but it wasn't that bad. The room was large enough and the bed was comfortable, but it had an old style TV - I'd say a slight update needs to be made to a flat-screen. I also would've appreciated better black-out curtains that covered all of the window instead of just most of the window, because the lights on the exterior of the hotel shined into my bedroom. The hotel seemed to be fairly quiet, so no complaints there. The free breakfast was adequate, and in fact, seemed pretty robust for just a continental breakfast. The in-room WiFi was also adequate, so no complaints there, especially since it was also complimentary. There was also an airport shuttle, although I didn't use it -- but I appreciated the complimentary parking. I also didn't use the indoor pool or hottub, but noted that they were available. The hotel staff were all friendly and accommodating, and service was speedy during check in and check out. All in all, this hotel met my needs perfectly, as I was looking for a clean and comfortable hotel near the Cleveland airport, at a very reasonable price.", "title": "No frills, no complaints", "user": "BethanieKay", "date": "October 30, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 144110016}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We were in the area for a family member's wedding, it was our first time to Ohio.

Rooms are fairly typical of the chain, with comfortable beds and solid furnishings. Bath towels are above average; bathtub has a shower mat pasted to the surface, so one has no choice but to shower rather than bathe. Continental breakfast is included in the rate, but is really nothing special. Many Best Westerns offer a better breakfast than this hotel's. About other reviewers complaining about hallways \"reeking\" of smoke: (1) I didn't notice it, and (2) how much time do you plan to spend in a hallway anyway? What is important is the comfort of your room, not the hallway! The hotel has a nice indoor pool; water temp. is a little cool, but not unpleasantly so. Overall, I would consider this a 3-star hotel, but the affordable rate (@ $79/night at BW's best rate) makes my review 4-star.

We could only swim a short time because it burned our eyes. You could even smell it in the lobby. Breakfast was good - pastries, waffles, fruit, yogurt, toast/bagels. The area is very convienient as well. We travel to Cleveland every year for baseball games since we are Indians fans. This location is good because its near 2 major freeways.
