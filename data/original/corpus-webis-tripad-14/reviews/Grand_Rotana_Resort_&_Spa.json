Jetty's out to the reef which is marked off so you are fairly safe to swim. Very good resturants, highly recommend Silk Road and the indian food, had a buter chicken curry better than here!! Will definately be returning with my family in the near future. One other point i feel i must mention, on arrival I was quite poorly with a tummy bug, at a lunch i was sitting next to the manager and he asked how i was. When i told him i went back to my room to find some tablets from the local docter delivered free of charge and they really did work!! I must stress i was NOT ill from this hotel though and the food was well above any standard you would get here. They have a fantastic kids club and a pony station for the little ones, also a fairly big sized gym. Saw all room types on our inspection and they were all of a good size, if you have loads of cash definately go for the royal suite though, oh my god it was amazing!!
