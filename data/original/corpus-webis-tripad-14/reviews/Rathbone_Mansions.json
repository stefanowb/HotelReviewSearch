In fact, almost everything outside of the building itself seemed to be nearly new. The main house (Rathbone Mansion) which was across the street from out room had a nice pool and hottub. We found it just like the picture on Rathbone's web site. The pool is not huge but we mostly had it to ourselves.

Esplanade and Rampart I was told was the boundary of the French Quarter which tourists should stay within. As it turned out Rathbone's neighborhood was ok. I wouldn't want to go any farther away from the French Quarter though. Another thing that I did not know prior to coming to New Orleans is that the first 4 or 5 blocks of Boubon street from Esplanade seems mostly desserted. I latter came to find out that there are expensive houses along the street but they do not open up to Bourbon street. I would recommend taking a cab home at night unless you are with a group or a very adventurous. After taking a run during the day and checking things out I didn't really feel completely comfortable walking to of from the French Quarter at night. It's probably ok but there are stretches where you might not see many other people and you could be a target.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 12, 2003", "id": 1224191}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved the Rathbone Inn !", "text": "Overall I would recommend this property. Not sure what the people that gave a poor review experienced. Not sure if the property has changed or what. We did not have a car so I can't comment on the parking. It appeared to me that people were parking in a gated area near the Rathbone mansion from what I could tell. From what I understand the property allows pets as well and has very reasonable weekday rates. We stayed on a weekend when hotels were very scarce and paid $129. There was a large convention in town and there were literally no rooms available at any of the hotels and B&B's were difficult to find rooms at as well.

I live right outside of New Orleans but I wanted to give our out of town guests a memorable visit.

We walked to bourbon street and the french market (our car stayed parked from the time we checked in until we checked out). The walk is not bad and we did not feel the least bit concerned of crime in that area. The locals are friendly and non-intimidating and everything that you would like to see or do is within reasonable walking distance, Cab fare is only a few dollars if you do not have the energy to walk.", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 8, 2004", "id": 2171444}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2004", "text": "It was a wonderful experience for all of us.", "title": "highly recommended", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "akell_11", "date": "May 11, 2004", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 1933415}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2005", "text": "This was my fourth trip to New Orleans and second stay at the Rathbone Inn.
