The reception staff were reasonably pleasant and helpful, the room was large & clean with everything we needed. The Kingsize bed was large and very comfy so we slept well. Bathroom was fine with good supply of toiletries. We did experience some noise from heavy footed people in the room above so would advise asking for a 2nd floor room although having made such a request, in advance, we were not given one. Swimming pool area is set out nicely with a good size pool, clean and warm and catches the sun all day. Hotel is about 10 minute walk in either direction to restaurants. Ate mainly at The Spotted Dog both for breakfast and dinner and found it to be very good in terms of price, service and quality. Although you have to pay extra for orange juice and coffee at breakfast they have a good selection of food and compared with other places in Springdale the price is very competitive.", "title": "Good hotel within walking distance of restaurants", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LeroyWirral", "date": "October 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 83610893}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We loved everything about the Desert Pearl Inn.
