We booked a private room, which meant that we got a room in an apartment up the street from the main Hobo Bear Hostel office. The apartment was warm, the shower was AMAZING, the room was clean and spacious and there was a computer with internet in the apartment for us to use free of charge! We were free to hang out at the main office/sitting room as we pleased and the reception staff were excellent for organising tours and giving directions and advice about the city. We were really pleasantly surprised by this gem of a hostel- I would not hesitate booking in again. Fantastic staff, fantastic hostel!", "title": "Great place", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ams8", "date": "October 15, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 83650286}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with friends", "text": "Hobo Bear has a very welcoming common room area, but unfortunately our room let us down a bit. We stayed in a 12-bed mixed dorm which was very hot despite a fan being provided and havig to leave the door open all night to benefit from the corridor's air conditioning. Furthermore, I stayed on a bottom bunk bed and the beds were so low that I couldn't hope to sit up straight (and I'm only 5'2\"). This hostel is small, with only 3 showers, yet busy - large dorms were full. The rooms do, nevertheless, have large, lockable lockers, which is always useful amongst large groups of guests.", "title": "quite small, busy hostel", "user": "zproud1", "date": "August 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 73382507}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Chill-out hostel in the heart of Zagreb", "text": "However, staff were friendly and helpful, allowing us to leave out bags in the common area and use the Internet after checkout since we had to wait for an overnight train.", "user": "Pat5150", "date": "July 16, 2010", "id": 71133581}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "A very cool hostel situated close to everything you'll want to see in Zagreb.
