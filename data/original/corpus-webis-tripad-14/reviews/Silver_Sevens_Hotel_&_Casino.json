The hotel was very gross. We walked into the casino and it didn't look all that bad. After checking in we were told where our room was. The hallways to the rooms was awful. There were stains up and down the wall and on the ceiling. You could smell vomit in the hallway and hear loud television sets going and small children crying (it was scary to think that families were most likely living in that place). The room was good sized and the air conditioner worked well, however the blankets and sheets were stained. The bathroom was not very clean and overall the room was scary. The good news was you could not hear any of the other rooms. The pool looked nice but we didn't really want to venture down to see it. We basically used the room as a changing place and stayed as little as possible. We did order room service one early morning (we were starving after a long night on the strip). The food was horrible, over priced and it took forever to get to our room.
