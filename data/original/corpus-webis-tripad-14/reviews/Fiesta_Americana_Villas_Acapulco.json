Book a room on one of the upper floors on the side facing the pool so that you can see the best sunset in Mexico each day. Some people do not like the music played at the bars along the Condesa, but it is really only an issue on weekends. This is by far the best hotel on the Condesa, and close to everything. Acapulco gets a lot of unfair negative press in the USA and elsewhere, but overall the city is safe, and you cannot find a safer place to stay than the Fiesta. Each room has a modern safe for valuables, and there is outstanding security in the hotel. I cannot wait to go back next year. This is my second home in sunny Acapulco. They treat repeat American guests very well. My only gripe is the timeshare people (who do not bother regular guests or try to sell you if decline a tour) and the people they bring to the hotel, but it is not a big deal, and the hotel does need to bring in revenue.", "title": "My 9th year staying here & still outstanding service & staff", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "NYCACAPULCOFAN", "date": "February 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 153311570}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013", "text": "There are perhaps 1-2 other hotels located on the bay that are in the category of the FA but none get higher check marks in all the categories above.", "title": "Best hotel on the strip", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "truck2chief", "date": "February 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 153256282}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "From the front desk to house keeping to the pool side and beach front service the Fiesta Americana has set a high level of excellence.", "title": "Three star rooms with five star \"views\"", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "lovetravel45068", "date": "February 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 153211690}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled with family", "text": "A very good option on Acapulco.
