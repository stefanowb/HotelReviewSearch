The hotel is a very contemporary style and very clean. Our room was quite small for four people. There was a double bed for my husband and I and a sofabed for my two children. I called down to reception after seeing the room and asked if they had a larger room for us but was told that I would have to pay 70 Euro extra per night and it was double the size of our room. We thought about it but decided to remain in the smaller room and save the money. We paid 17 Euro each for breakfast (kids were free) which is expensive but it is an excellent buffet breakfast. Eggs, sausages, potatoes, waffles, pastries, cold cuts, fruit, juices, coffee, tea etc. If you just have coffee and a muffin for breakfast then you should go out of the hotel to a coffee shop but if you like to eat a big breakfast, it is worth the 17 Euro to eat here.", "title": "A surprisingly excellent hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Mrhreid", "date": "June 7, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 16743526}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008", "text": "There is a small indoor pool and a small gym that opens at around 6am and closes at 11pm. My kids used the pool almost every night. During the week it was empty but when it came to the weekend, it got very busy there. I used the gym but on one of the nights the weight equipment was broken as a child had used it incorrectly and tangled the wires. There is apparently no age requirement to use the gym in Germany like in the USA, so young kids were in the gym messing around on the treadmill and the weights. This was not good as there is only one treadmill and one epiliptical machine so if they are on it, you can't use it. I only had this problem at the weekend. During the week, I had the gym to myself. It is also very dangerous for little kids to use the gym as they don't know how to use weights and the equipment. I'm very surprised that there is no age requirement. The other problem I had was that there were 2 computers in the lobby to use free of charge but one of them was out of order for the whole 5 days I was there. There were always people waiting to use the computer. There was a very angry man who was trying to print out his boarding pass and said that everytime he came down from his room, the computer was being used. If you want to use the computer, you have to stay there in line. I complained to the front desk that I needed to check my flight information and that a person was on the computer for a long time.
