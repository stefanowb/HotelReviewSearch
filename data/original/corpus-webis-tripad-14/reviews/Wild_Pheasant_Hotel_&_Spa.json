We had room 224 at the back of the hotel, at the end of the corridoor so it was nice and tucked out of the way :) The room was lovely, and we soon settled in. The only thing i would say is that there was some black mould on the ceiling near the window, but this didnt really bother us! The bed was massive which was really nice! The lounge area, downstairs by the bar was ful of chesterfield sofas and with free wifi it was a great place to wait whilst waiting to be seated for dinner. Dinner in the hotel resturant was lovely and very reasonably priced for three courses for \u00a324.95. The waitresses were all really helpful, especially a lady called Ellen, who was so lovely and polite she really made my trip! Breakfast the next morning was tasty, apart from the fact i asked for a poached egg, and when it came mine and my boyfriends eggs were stone cold all the way through. The spa was really nice, but we didnt get a robe or slippers? Not sure if you have to have a treatment to get those? However we did use the tanning bed, and there was no information or advice about it so we were unsure as to how long to go on for, how often etc which led to us getting a bit burnt! The hyrda pool was really quiet at all times when we went in which was really nice to have it to ourselves. The second meal of our stay was really nice and again breakfast the next morning was much better as we both had hot scrambled egg this time. We checked out an hour early as we had a long way to drive back, and 20 mins into our journey realised i had left my glasses in the dresser draw, after calling them they were more than happy to check my room and bring them down for me to collect. I can comment on the price as we had our 2 night stay brought for us as a present, but overall it was really lovley, set in a beautiful place which made it very romantic and i would definatley go back again!!!", "title": "Best short break ever for a young couple!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shrimpy3", "date": "April 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 105239623}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "The Positive-Overall the Hotel was great.

We didn't eat our meal and at \u00a356 for 2 courses each (we didn't want a desert after what we'd experienced) it was not cheap.
