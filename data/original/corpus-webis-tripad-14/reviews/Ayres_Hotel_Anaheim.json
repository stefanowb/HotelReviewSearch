The rooms are very good and clean. They are not fancy but this isn't 5 star. Air con, fans, kitchen facilities, TV, pool...all great. It is about 15 mins on the local bus to Disneyland but this is from the hotel to the park and at $4 for an all day ticket it was very good. There is not much around the Ayers by way of restaurants, convenience stores or markets so you will need to cab or drive to most places. We were here for two nights so the bar and grill next door was dinner two nights running, but the food, value and service was good so not problems there. With free parking it is handy for those with a car. The front reception service is fantastic with the team happy to offer advice and information about outlet shops, bus transport and other to do recommendations. The breakfast was a great addition with plenty of variety but with a small dining hall, avoid the 730 to 8 peak. The only complaint was a missed morning wake up call but we managed to rush around and get organised quickly for Disneyland - a small fault in otherwise a very good and affordable hotel.

I have taken my growing family here for trips to Disneyland 5 separate times. Cleanliness is very important to us at hotels and this place is very clean. They have also gone to a lot of effort to upgrade the facilities over the years, before we would have thought it was even needed. Rugs were replaced and furniture was upgraded. The breakfasts are awesome. No cleaning ladies reheating food. This place has a chef who will take your order and make you a great breakfast, in addition to a lot of self-serve food as well. He has been there every year and is very friendly to the guests. Generally speaking they seem to put a lot of effort into maintaining their #1 rating in Anaheim. The key here is that this place is also affordable. Hopefully the recent rewards don't result in higher prices. Anyway, keep up the great work.
