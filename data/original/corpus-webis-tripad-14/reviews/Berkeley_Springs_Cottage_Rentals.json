More surprising is when matters were brought to management, it was received in a condescending inhospitable manner, we're told they had no other properties to move us to and didn't give additional discounts, neither of which we requested. No mention of refund or additional cleaning visit. When asked if increasing our price point for future visits would ensure a rental more up to our standards, we were asked to take our business elsewhere in the future. Imagine giving glowing reviews and consistent business to a company, just to be told you're no longer wanted/welcome due to a poorly handled hospitality issue! An additional discount was issued upon returning home. This discount is an admission of guilt on their part (so we'll take it) their failure to provide accommodations up to the standards we've come to expect from them. Disloyalty, lack of concern for customers / inability to address obvious maintenance indicates standards have slipped in recent years.

We thought the place was down home and very enjoyable. If you are looking for a new, upscale vacation home, then this is not your place. River's Edge is a down to earth older place on the river. It was spotless and the downstairs bed was comfortable. We didn't try upstairs. The sectional does have a couple of hard spots where the cushions have worn and a few chairs need to be tossed outside. For us, this was minor compared to the river, which is very clear and calm, practically out the back door. It is very peaceful. The river bed is quite rocky, so we wore old tennis shoes in which, I think, worked better than water shoes. The yard is level with a nicely placed fire ring, where you can look up at the stars. The road was not well traveled, so the traffic noise was not a problem for us. The musty smell was typical of all places on the river and easily cleared by opening the windows for a bit.

Each cabin is more than a room for the night, it is a home. All rentals have their own charm and own stories. They truly have something for everyone. Whether it\u2019s a fire place and a hot tube, or a gourmet kitchen and a big screen TV, these cabins have it all. One great thing about this rental company is that it is family owned/operated. From the moment I arrived in Berkeley Springs, I was not treated as a customer, but like another member of their family. Their hospitality is top of the line. Upon check-in, I was given their cell phone number to call with any questions/concerns, day or night. Making my stay perfect always seems to be their number one concern. For example, during one of my stays, there was a snow storm on our last night at the cabin. As we were leaving, my small car had gotten stuck in a patch of snow, just outside of town. Mr. Rebant came and got me going again before AAA could even get there! Where else can you get that service and attention to detail!?
