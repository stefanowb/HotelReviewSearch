The smallest one I could come up with would be the relatively weak signal on the WiFi. But that's it ! Reception/check in was courteous , efficient and professional. The rooms had everything. We couldn't think of one thing missing. ...from fully stocked fridge ( re-replenished daily ) ...shoe shine ..desk equipped with hole punch to paper clips... superb big bed...choice of pillows.... 2 nice big TV's ... individual setting for the AC in both the lounge area and bedroom...Comfy bathrobes and slippers ....Breakfast is great - good range of food, you can sit inside or outside, efficient service. ...The staff at the front desk Oh , Ping and Krung did everything for us...from booking a restaurant ..to taxis..to trips.
