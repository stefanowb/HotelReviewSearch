Very close to drive and explore the ironbridge gorge and the blist hill victorian town which was wonderful fun and a memorable birthday experience for my mum on a chilly october day! I had booked a twin room, which had been made up as a double by mistake, but was quickly sorted while we had a drink in the bar. The rooms are very floral lovely for the ladies, and comfortable. The bathroom let it down slightly, although large, the bath shower had a hand held shower head which was good and powerful and hot but did mean the walls got sprayed a bit when washing your hair, and no extractor fan meant condensation dripped down and the floor got wet, also not too keen on the metal wall mounted toilet paper dispenser either but these are minor things for what was a lovely stay. Our evening meal was enjoyable, there was a theme night of game meat on but as this was my mum's birthday it wasn't going to put us off eating there although i'm veggie. Mum had fish anyway from the other menu and loved it, I was a little disappointed on the hot veggie choice and as I'd spied stilton mushrooms wrapped in bacon and asked if this could be cooked without the bacon wrap was told a firm no by the waitress, the soup was very nice however. My main course was disappointing but credit to chef / patron Stuart who came over and asked for feedback and gave my dessert complimentary, and again I s'pose the night was geared up for game.
