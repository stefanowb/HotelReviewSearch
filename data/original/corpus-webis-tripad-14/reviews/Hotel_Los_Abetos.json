I have nothing bad to say of our stay here. Our Junior Suite was perfect. The private, at the door, parking spot is unheard of in European hotels. The suite was large, the beds comfortable and quiet. We didn't have much of a view but after being on the road for several weeks, we welcomed our ability to spread out and relaxed. We walked into Santiago one morning and found that no issue. It was too early in the season for the pool to be open. Breakfast was fine as it ticked all the usual boxes. The price was really quite reasonable for what we got in value and comfort.

There were two of us and I speak Spanish, but the other person didn't, so that was what brought the abruptness to the fore. I needed to see a doctor when I was there, at a cost of ninety euro.
