When we arrived we were delighted to find a welcome card and chocolates in the room, but I was rather disappointed with the \"suite\" (No 19) as it was just a hotel room, although the bathroom was enormous. We were also aware of next door's plumbing! The following morning I mentioned my disappointment to the lovely girl on reception. When we returned from a day's sightseeing our belongings had been moved to suite 29, which was beautiful - twice the size of the previous room and much quieter. It had two sofas, a decent sized dining table for breakfast and four floor to ceiling windows looking down on the crescent below.

Our room had a very large bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub and separate shower. There was an entertainment center with a good TV with MANY channels and an accompanying DVD player. The Residence had movies that you could borrow to watch, which we didn't take advantage of, but was a nice touch. There was also a stocked mini bar with enough room to store your own supplies. The bedding and towels were clean and the room was made up meticulously every day. The lounge or sitting area had an honor bar, several places to sit, and a computer with free internet access for guests. The entire building felt more like the name implies-a residence. No chain hotel feel here. There was a lot of beautiful furniture and lovely woodwork. The Residence is on a quiet street that is still within easy walking distance from most of the Edinburgh sights. As for the staff, they were largely very good. However, the day before we left, I put in a request for an early wake up call and a cab to the airport. When we arrived back from dinner that night, I just happened to ask the (different) desk staff to confirm my request. My wake up call and cab weren't in the book. I don't know what possessed me to ask, but it was a good thing I did. Still, we enjoyed our stay at the Residence and loved the city of Edinburgh and Scotland in general.
