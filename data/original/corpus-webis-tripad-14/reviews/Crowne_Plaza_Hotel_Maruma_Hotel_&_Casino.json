When the phone could not be fixed I was upgraded to a better room in the new wing without even requesting the upgrade. Venezuelan hotels are often criticized for poor service, but I thought that the desk staff and management were extremely helpful. Yes, there were minor issues-- the hot water ran out at times. But this is a nice hotel in what appeared to be a safe area. And again, the staff and management were helpful and seemed genuinely interested in providing a comfortable and nice stay. My rating for value is relatively low only because of the current exchange rate--not the fault of the hotel.
