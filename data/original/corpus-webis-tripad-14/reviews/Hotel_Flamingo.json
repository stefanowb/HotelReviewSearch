Decor was very good as was the servicing of the room, however it was often impossible to get a hot shower mainly at the times of heavy use. There was a bidet which helps in that situation! We asked to move and could have after the Italian holiday crush of 15th August was over but by that time could not be bothered. There was no iron and none provided when we asked. The spa was Ok but had shabby spots and did not compare favourably with other 4 star spas. The gym we used every day but it was not swept or cleaned once and there was a curtain dividing the gym from the entertainment team's HQ, they often left the door open causing the inadequate air conditioning to become ineffective and at no time did any staff appear in the gym. The Hotel claims 2 restaurants but there is only 1 in practice and the outside seating is hard to find at breakfast and lunch and not allowed in the evening - at least for us. Queing to be seated and waiting while more food is brought to the buffet at lunch detracts from the good quality of the food in general although why anyone would want to eat salmon while on the Medditerranean I don't know. Drinks are very expensive wine is a minimum of \u00a314.00 per bottle but you can go to the campsite over the road to buy wine etc. If you walk for 20 minutes along the beach (away from Pula) there is another campsite with pizzeria which is even cheaper and has a nice setting. Walking the other way you come to the Nide 5 star bit which looked a bit half built with Wild Duck restaurant (we didn't try it having read the other reviews) then the 3 star Marie Pineda which was peaceful and lovely and far less crowded and noisy. On departure we checked our bill against the slips which we kept and discovered \u00a327.00 had been added for drinks and pizza we didn't have and hadn't signed for. Car hire was around \u00a3200 for 3 days minimum, bike hire was \u00a355.00 per day! So we stayed at the hotel but did have a lovely walk along the little gravel road towards Pula. We enjoyed our holiday and the evening entertainment was excellent including a 5 course meal with free sparkling wine and spit roast pork and fireworks on the festival day. Another day there was a seemingly well known Italian singer with a great set. The Hotel Flamingo was like a gentrified Butlins.
