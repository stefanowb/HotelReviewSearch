I've stayed in downtown Montreal before, but since my meetings were near the airport I didn't feel a need to be downtown on this trip. This was probably the best Courtyard I've ever stayed at. No matter where you were in the hotel (lobby, business center, restaurant, bar, etc.) it had a comfortable atmosphere and the staff was very friendly. The hotel shuttle was quick and convenient. There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance and only 1 to 2 blocks away. There's also a movie theater and a large shopping mall in walking distance. It was raining when I was there so I was mostly confined to my room. The room was average size, but due to the unique layout it felt spacious. The bed was comfortable and so was the sofa for watching TV. The only thing that would have made this an excellent rating for me would be the analog TV signal. I don't understand why most of these hotels are upgrading to nice flat screen TV's but not upgrading to a digital signal. All this does is magnify the fuzzy picture. If I wasn't in the hotel for most of the evening, this would not have been a big deal.

I know it's been a while but I had forgotten to write a review and looking back I really wanted to compliment the hotel staff for making our stay excellent. The hotel is close to the airport so there is nothing really much to do right around the hotel but this is to be expected as it is mainly a business hotel. There are some good restaurants right nearby including a couple bars and a sports bar. I had never been to Montr\u00e9al and recommend it to everybody after going. It is a great town! Back to the hotel, all of the staff at front desk were very friendly and helpful. We had an accessibility issue at the racetrack with my motorized wheelchair and the hotel staff lent us a manual chair for the entire weekend. This truly saved our trip. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel's restaurant and it was very good and reasonably priced. The wait staff were also very friendly (I'm sure it didn't hurt that they were mostly Latin as am I. A little Spanish in Montr\u00e9al goes a long way apparently). We stayed a couple extra days after the races in order to enjoy the city and one of those days we met the hotel's general manager recommended we drive to Mont Tremblant. The drive was a little over an hour and was definitely worth it, this is a beautiful little town up in the mountains. After doing some shopping the last day, I had purchased an item which turns out wouldn't fit in my luggage. Again, the helpful general manager made sure to send it by mail to my house. We were out of the hotel almost the entire day every day and without exception, our rooms were impeccable every time we returned.
