The hotel is beautiful, the staff very friendly -the entertainment staff being exceptional. The room waslarge, we had two huge double beds aswell as chairs and a small table and it was spotless! Now the negatives, we were all inclusive so if we asked for a beer at the bar it was served in a very small, what can only be described as a champagne flute! All other alcoholic drinks were served in small wine glasses, however, if you were half board and paid for drinks then your beer was served in a pint glass and spirit measures were triple, and VERY cheap. The restaurant is very nice but the food is definitely not a 4* standard - I have had better food in 3* hotels we've stayed in, not alot of choice and very repetitive. If you are looking for a break with nice surroundings and a bit of a laugh, then fine but just go half board! Oh one more thing - if you like the use of a gym thisi snt the place as ALL equipment is broken!!!!", "user": "sunlovinbabeEngland", "date": "May 8, 2010", "id": 63560251}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Can't wait to go back!!

All the staff are great, really friendly and made us feel welcome. The hotel its self is beautiful and was alot better than i expected, however the main pool was smaller than i thought as the picture is misleading. the food was great, a lot of choice everyday and all delicious.

I can see why people go to Tunisia. Tunisians welcome you warmly because in this region Tourism is their livelihood. For this reason alone I felt extremely safe and wouldn't believe that security would ever be an issue at all. You do get a little annoyed however being in the markets and EVERYONE wanting to sell you something. I think this has to be the worst bit about the whole holiday. It does really annoy you after a while! It is actually hard work to shop! As soon as you say you're English they have \"a question\" I didn't want to know the question! \"No questions!\" It makes me laugh thinking about it now. Found a few sellers claiming to be the waiter from the hotel and happen to have an uncle or a brother with a shop. Believe this and you deserve to be conned! There is a commission sellers make if you go and buy carpet! Tunisian carpets are great and only selling for 2 days! This is the 2nd day.

With the over weight sweating entertainment boss hogging the limelight!!! I go on holiday to experience the culture of the country, Not to watch they'er interpretation of irish dance or Grease! Service at the Hotel was good, Down sides of the Holiday was being harrassed to buy everywhere i went, locals on the beach trying to scam you out of money. The airport at monastir is a nightmare, no queuing system or order at passport control, take plenty of tissues as you are expected to pay up to two dinars for a few pieces of loo roll in public toilets.

Ahmed, Marvin, Safoune, Abdul and Gi Gi are legend. They really made our holiday and the amount of effort the hotel made to make guests feel comfortable and the entertainment they provided was fantastic. Every night there was a show be it cabaret or a competition. The resort is 5 minutes from the beach and a nice stroll to the medina. Everything is so cheap and the people are lovely. It does help to be thick skinned as the sale methods and men can be a bit trying at time but I found them so funny and friendly.

Our party of five, made up of two sisters, a teenager and two elderly parents, both with walking difficulties booked the vacation through Thomas Cook for one week staying at this hotel on a half board basis. After an uneventful and hassle free departure through the airport we proceeded to our awaiting coach, promptly leaving for the one hour and twenty minute drive to the resort. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a fairly nondescript lobby but a much more pleasant receptionist! We were kindly asked to be seated while we waited for our rooms to be ready and were soon accompanied by a free cocktail. Within twenty minutes we were pleasantly surprised by our rather large bedroom and even bigger bathroom! The bedroom was of a very good size, free fridge, sat TV, nice view and a safe (21 Dn) and two reasonably sized beds. The hotel offers two nice freshwater pools surrounded by nice bushes and flowers. The only downside is the fight for the sun beds, early morning rush for the best of the bunch as is usually the case in most hotels. The hotel offers half board or all inclusive and we all agreed the half board option is by far the optimal choice. Food and drinks were not so plentiful for the all inclusive guests; however, we were all basing our decision on the Caribbean! Choose half board, stroll one hundred metres to the nearest supermarket, fill up your fridge and enjoy the saving. Food at the hotel is of a particularly high standard, all factors considered of course. The breakfast was appreciated by my son as the pancakes were top quality. Fresh bread, eggs, fruit and a hot milky coffee were all we needed to embark on the day ahead. The evening meal was fine; however, by the end of the week we felt it got a little repetitive. The entertainment team were really friendly guys who did a good job with their renditions of different things; we did not seem to have the privilege of any professional groups etc. though. The ice white, fine sandy beach is accessed through the garden, across a road and a quick 200 metre stroll away. The hotel has its own section of the beach which is patrolled by the hotel staff and the occasional policeman on horseback. All in all we felt quite safe on the beach, even two ladies alone. Alcohol is on offer at the hotel but if you want to purchase your own, the only place to buy it is in a supermarket opposite the marina called Bravo. Outside the hotel you can catch the little train, it runs frequently and only costs 2.50 Dn or alternatively all other forms of transport are cheap to the marina or medina. In summary I would say Tunisia is definitely trying to expel its negative image of yesteryear, but you do still get moderately hassled to buy inside the medina. Of the hotel I would say if you are looking for an easy going hotel in a fairly quiet location with reasonable food and accommodation, then this is a good value for money choice.", "user": "hannahst25", "date": "July 12, 2010", "id": 70587915}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "One of the best", "text": "Although Thomas Cook recommended this hotel because it had a walk in shower which suited us as my husband is in a wheelchair we took their word for it and booked to go first week November to celebrate my husbands birthday. Yes ok the room was good although the view from any of these four rooms was a border of high trees, dark and dismal. The larger pool we could'nt use as the longers are very close together and in rows no room to transfer my husband onto a sun longer. The pathways around the hotel were all small cobbled stone its a wonder my husband did'nt get whiplash !!!!! The smaller pool was fine but was difficult getting to, because of the wheelchair on thse stoney pathways. So dont go if you are less mobile or in a wheelchair.
