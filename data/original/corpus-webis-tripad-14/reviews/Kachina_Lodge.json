They were right. It is true the lodge is mired in the 50's in decor and amenities, but the view (we paid for a rim view room)is great. We also woke up to two elk outside our window engaging in a little \"rack\" wrestling. I went out to take pictures and found these wild animals thoroughly ingore you. (I don't know what happens during the rut season!) Got pictures of an elk by the flagpole that had a rack bigger than the width of my outstretched arms. He was obviously accustomed to tourists and cameras, and some hardy souls got to within 8 feet of him as he strolled casually down the rim path. The Canyon itself is awesome, but the experience of the wildlife was a wonderful extra. I think they come in to graze on the irrigated lawns which must be like dessert to them after eating scrub grass and brush all day.

I was expecting it to be quite basic from the reviews on site and indeed it was. Quite old fashioned in style with very basic furniture and furnishings and basic bathroom. However everything was functional and clean and the view more than made up for everything. Whatever you do don't stay off the Grand Canyon National Park however much you want luxurious accommodation which this clearly isn't. You really want to be there so you can see the sun go down and come up and experience the whole thing. To have stayed just outside the National Park would have been a real let down. It's just a shame that the accommodation isn't better, particularly as it isn't cheap! The best would be to stay in the El Torvar hotel which is clearly a more luxrious option but this seems to get booked up very quickly so I would advise booking as soon as possible. I tried about 6 weeks before we went and it was fully booked. The thing that saved our room was being in the National Park and the fact that we had a view out over the Canyon! Can anything be better?? We were able to get up at 4.30am to see the sunrise and there were lots of deer playing outside our room on the grass which was fantastic to see. We ate in the El Torvar hotel in the evening and it is barely 5 minutes walk away which was handy. There was plenty of parking although it is a bit of a walk from the carpark to the room with suitcases but service was efficient and all in all I was pleasantly surprised at how good the whole experience was.
