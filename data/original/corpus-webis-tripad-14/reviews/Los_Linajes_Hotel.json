We had been staying in modern, recently renovated hotels so Los Linajes was a bit of a let down in comparison. The hotel has a musty smell, probably due to the old wall-to-wall carpeting, and the decor is outdated too. However, the hotel is charming in its own way, and our room had a lovely view of the Iglesia de la Vera Cruz and the surrounding hills. Also, it\u2019s located just a short walk away from the old part of town. The staff, while not overly friendly, was pleasant enough and gave us a really great restaurant recommendation for our last night in Spain \u2013 Meson la Cueva. One piece of advice: if you are driving a mini-van or a van you may not want to park in the hotel garage \u2013 you have to drive through very narrow streets in the heart of the old city to get to the garage and the clearance is low.", "title": "Outdated but Overall a Good Choice", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "SpainTrip_May2008", "date": "June 2, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 16618634, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 View from Room", "disliked": "\u2014 Musty Smell"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008", "text": "For the price this is the absolute gem other contributing reviewers tell you it is.

We dropped off our bags and got excellent and easy-to-follow directions to the garage parking beneath the hotel (would not be easy to find without directions). Once there you just take the lift into the hotel. The man on reception was so helpful over this. I do sympathise though with the reviewer who in spite of booking parking was told on arrival that it was full \u2013 that would certainly take the edge off the whole experience. We not only advance booked the parking but also called 2 days ahead and on the day of arrival to stress that we had done so; perhaps it\u2019s a good idea to do that, just to be sure.", "title": "Superb - one of the best stays of our holiday", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Northerner44", "date": "November 2, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 10550080, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Superb room, views, good service", "disliked": "\u2014 Nothing"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled with family", "text": "A charming hotel in the perfect area of the old city.
