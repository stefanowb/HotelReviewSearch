Only complaint was the one single duvet they gave me and I had to ask for another as it was freezing in the room and I like a big duvet. But they brought it up promptly to me. I didn't eat breakfast as was busy having a lie in! Great location next to the nationaltheater station and the bar was very full with a nice atmosphere when we arrived at 8.30pm.
