There are lots of nice touches such as the fridge in the room as well as other gadgets such as a CD player. Breakfast was good (and certainly the best sausages on our two week trip) and Alena, in particular, was very attentive and keen to ensure everything was in order. On the down side the bathroom was a bit tight on size and as the shower was in the bath some guests might find it difficult to get in and out. Although on a busy road the fact it is so close to the shops and restaurants in town means it is only a short stroll to everything you need in the evening.", "title": "Good location", "user": "BigMac58", "date": "October 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 181389715}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled with family", "text": "My Grandmother and I spent a few nights in different parts of England, and when we came upon this place, we were blown away with the comfortable situation and hospitality of Annesdale House.

The owners of the place are eager to ensure that every need is met, the food prepared leaves nothing to be desired, and the location puts everything within a short walk's reach.
