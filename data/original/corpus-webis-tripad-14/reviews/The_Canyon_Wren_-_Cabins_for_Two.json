We were searching the internet for a nice cozy place to stay, away from all the daily activities and stresses. With two teenagers, busy schedules, hectic jobs, and conflicting schedules, we needed some alone time with each other to rekindle a romance that was starting to fade away. We found Canyon Wren Cabins for Two on a Google search and i thought to myself, this is perfect! My wife called the 800# given on the website and she talked to Milena. She was very nice on the telephone and very accommodating to our needs. We booked and off we went. Having been to Sedona many times, we had no problem finding the cabins, other then passing them by the first time. Six miles from the exit of Main Sedona was exactly the right mileage. We arrived with a pleasant welcome from Milena and Mike the owners of the property. Milena gave us the complete top to bottom tour of our cabin which was the Wild Rose Cabin. The cabin was immaculate and just cozy, very well kept and everything for a romantic weekend was in place. The hummingbird feeder outside the breakfast table was a nice touch in the mornings. My expectations were exceeded by how much detail was put into these cabins. Every morning we would wake up at the crack of dawn to enjoy the bird sanctuary on site. Just sitting on the swings and enjoying nature and all its quiet beauty was enough to bring us back. We are already planning to come back sometime this October to stay at the same cabin. Definitely recommended to anyone who needs a quiet getaway with no disturbances from televisions, telephones, computers, kids, traffic, work and anything else getting in the way of romance.
