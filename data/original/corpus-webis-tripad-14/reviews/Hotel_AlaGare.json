The fact that we had some rowdy neighbours probably didn't help. Also in the morning the room smelt like the toilet had been leaking. Needless to say we vacated as soon as possible.", "user": "albertsgoldenboot", "date": "August 30, 2005", "id": 3816316}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great Base for Exploration", "text": "For breakfast we had to go down 1 lift and up another as there are 2 buildings.
