At the meeting first choice are in with a company called Lion who try to get you to go to a meeting selling future holidays, in return they will give you a \u00a350 vouchure to be used against trips. We did this trip just to get the \u00a350, basically its time share under another guise, they will try t o sell you cheap holidyas for 3 years and quote silly prices to lure you. There is a membership fee which they will not telll you until a lot later in the meeting. 2 hours or more. you only have to stay for an hour and a half to qualify. The rep was some wide boy from London. After 2 and a nhalf hours we said enough was enough and wrapped the meeting up. it was only then that they said that it would be \u00a32800 for 3 years membership and the price of the holiday. They do try to give you a free holiday but you end up paying for that in the price The rep tried to price our previous holiday to New York last Oct, he promised us it would be at least 30% cheaper, when it came up on the computer it was more expensive.

So if you don't mind staying at the hotel for the entirety of your holiday then it's fine. Although you will get bored of eating exactly the same food every single day and sitting in the 'bar' aka the recetion area with absolutely no atmosphere. However it's a First Choice hotel and they should be sued under the trade descriptions act for saying the provide 'entertainment'. What they provide is a couple of frustrated karakoe singers who think that a lunch time quiz and a game of darts is an inventive way of entertaining holiday makers. The evening 'entertainment' is ten times worse. You get Stacey singing her favourite Dolly Parton tunes. I'd rather scratch my eyes out that have to listen to that again. Most of the staff in the hotel are fine but we ended up complaining about some of the men in the dining room for jeering and leering at us.
