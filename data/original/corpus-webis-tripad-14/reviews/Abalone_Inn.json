It has some odd aspects to it that some people will not like. For example, the rooster crows at 5am, but breakfast isn't served until 9am. You aren't allowed to wear shoes in the house and there is only half and half for coffee (from a local dairy), but no milk. The eggs are fresh from two hens that keep the rooster company.", "title": "Quirky place", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "catwings", "date": "May 9, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5045004}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not all that it's cracked up to be.", "text": "There is a hot tub, which is private enough to use in the nude... but one must walk out the front door, down some steps, through a back patio to get to it.
