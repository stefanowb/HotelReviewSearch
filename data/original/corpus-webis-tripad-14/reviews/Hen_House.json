The breakfast is as good as described by other reviewers on here. The bed was so comfortable with a top quality 1000 pocket sprung mattress and crisp 100% cotton bedlinen that it was like climbing onto a cloud to sleep. Follow all of Sandy & Gary's recommendations for restaurants and beaches; we did and every one was great. Our puppy Oscar was inseparable from our hosts' retriever Morgan and he was so happy exploring the wildflower meadow every day. It was great not to have to stress about a single thing and every local establishment welcomed us and our puppy warmly. The food in this area is fantastic, so we quickly abandoned any ideas of travelling further afield and stayed on the Lizard.

Stayed in bantam barn which is their self catering barn so had our own little kitchen which was handy for quick teas after a long days walking the cliff tops of the beautiful lizard. The location is excellent if you're after a peaceful and relaxing break from the hustle and bustle of day to day life, it's off the main route and the night sky has got to be seen to be believed, light pollution has a lot to answer for! It's easy to get back onto the main road that leads through the heart of the area though, we explored a large chunk of it and it never took us more than about half an hour to get anywhere and that's more to do with the location of the roads as opposed to the distance! The south west coastal path goes almost all the way round the edge of the peninsula and has some fantastic walks which are definitely worth looking into, we spent almost the whole week walking with Griffin our dog and ventured all the way down to the most southerly point and right the way up to Falmouth with it's opportunity for river cruises and ferries across the Helford. The whole area is every dog friendly, most of the pubs, cafes and tourist attractions locally allow dogs in, though some restaurants have restricted access. Would highly recommend Roskillys farm with their restaurant and home made ice cream - we tried a different flavour almost every day, apple crumble; genius!! The hosts Garry and Sandy made us feel so welcome, arrived quite late and were given some cake and a little jug of milk ready for morning tea, they also lent us an OS map which was invaluable and their recommendations of walks etc were very useful, we'll definitely be returning!!", "title": "Tea on arrival", "user": "KnackeredSailor", "date": "July 24, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 115704957}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 4, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 36}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
