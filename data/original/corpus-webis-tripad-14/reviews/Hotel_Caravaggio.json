The bathroom was small and the bath tub very small but everything was spotless. Our room was on the front of the building so we got some street noise, especially early in the morning. A room that does not face the street would probably have been better. However, we managed very well and enjoyed our stay of three nights. The breakfast is typical for an Italian three star hotel.
