We arrived to a friendly greeting and were shown around. As it was our honeymoon we were even given a complimentary bottle of wine. If there was anything we needed, all we had to do was ask. The hotel itself is only round the corner from the pier, and we were surprised how quiet it was. Breakfast was served every morning to a high standard, and the staff that served it were always friendly and were lovely to chat to.

All rooms are comfortably furnished, well-appointed doubles arranged over three floors and all are en-suite with power showers. Rooms at the front have a limited sea-view, and all other rooms face the rear of the property. Many unexpected little extras make a stay at The Eastleigh a little more special. The Eastleigh is 'room-only' and does not offer any meals, which is reflected in the attractive room rates. Allocated parking in the private car park is available for some rooms, otherwise there is ample on-street unlimited free parking."}
