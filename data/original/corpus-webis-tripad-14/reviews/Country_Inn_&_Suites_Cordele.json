Hotel was a very good value -- a suite with separate living area for the price of a room at any other hotel. Facility and room were exceptionally clean. Located in an area where there is some construction, but that wasn't too much of a problem other than the entrance was being re-graded and dug up - still, we got in/out with no issues. Staff, especially the lady overseeing the breakfast, was friendly and helpful. The breakfast is good and has a decent variety. If you want more choice, there is a Cracker Barrel one exit north. For a free breakfast, the hotel's offering will more than suffice. I knew they were pet friendly prior to my visit, and while that wasn't preferable to me, I realize a number of travelers are looking for a place that is. I could hear a small dog barking at night, but it wasn't that excessive; the hotel met all of my other requirements (safe area, location, price, offering suites), so I was prepared to deal with the pet issue. There's a little \"hall noise\" at times, but again not that bothersome. Mostly, this can be heard from the livng area of the suite. We were on the side away from the interstate, so I can't say how the rooms on the interstate side are; but we sat out by the pool one evening and the while the hotel is close to the interstate, the traffic noise wasn't that loud. The parking lot is well lit and the area seemed reasonably safe for an interstate-side hotel. The hotel is kind of out to itself right now, but a new little strip shopping center is being developed just across the access road.", "title": "Best place in town", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Corn&Beans", "date": "May 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 65970605}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Country Inn on our way through Georgia.

The air conditioner is set up in a way that you cannot leave the fan on (to drown out the traffic noise) without turning off the air conditioning. I've had much more elaborate continental breakfasts at other hotels, there was not much to choose from at this one.
