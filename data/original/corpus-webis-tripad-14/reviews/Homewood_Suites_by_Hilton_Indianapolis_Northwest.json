Definitely no noise issues. It seemed fairly new, not sure when it was built, but the rooms, hallways, common areas, etc. showed no signs of wear, and things were kept relatively clean throughout the property. One exception was the dining area - it wasn't \"dirty\" per se, but could have used a bit more attention during the busy eating times - dinner and breakfast. I think they keep it staffed fairly tightly - one or two people running it all, and they did a fantastic job at keeping the food and drink areas well stocked, rotated, and replenished. The table cleanliness is just a nit, didn't detract from the mealtime at all. The breakfast spread was great - plenty of hot and cold items, much much more than typical continental type breakfast spreads. Also nice is the \"manager's reception\" on M - Th evenings - it's really dinner, but they just have one choice...it's not a buffet. The night I was there, they had hot dogs, macaroni/cheese, and salad, plus free wine/beer if you want.

First impressions upon entering the building are positive; nice decor. The common area used for manager receptions and breakfast is also well appointed. Front desk staff was friendly and professional. Hotel was clean and well maintained. My room was excellent (I stayed for two nights). Housekeeping did a great job. Pillows and mattresses were extremely comfortable. Dual zone heating system kept me warm. Showers had ample hot water. The room had everything I expected for a Homewood Suites. Yes, I-465 skirts right by the front of the hotel. For me, the road noise was not bothersome. Late at night there just isn't that much traffic, plus when the heater kicked in, the blower fan muffled any road noise (by the way, the heater noise was normal for such a unit). Ask for a rear room if you think traffic noise would be a problem. Big breakfast fans will be pleased with the neighboring Cracker Barrell restaurant within walking distance.

I can't tell you how great it was just to go downstairs to fix a plate for my son while my husband watched over him. And the food was GREAT! For breakfast....name something, they had it.
