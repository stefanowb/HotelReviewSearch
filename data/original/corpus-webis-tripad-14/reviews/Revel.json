They have areas that only hotel guests can access, which I think is great. The fact that its smoke free was good (its nice to go back to your room and not smell like a smoker). They have a lot of self check in kiosks around the lobby, which are really easy to use, the only downfall is that you can't ask for anything specific, like a high room or a certain view. We did self check in and ended up on the 2nd floor. So if you don't care where your room in, the self check out is great. I didn't give it a 5 for three reasons. One is because all of the restaurants and stores are really expensive and limited. They don't have any shopping that an average person can really shop in. The cheap pocket books are $100+. The restaurants are expensive, and not very filling. Unless you get apps and dessert, expect to leave hungry and a lot lighter in the wallet. Another reason is because the casino is terrible. It's beautiful, clean, smoke free, but don't expect your money to go far. Your lucky if you get 10 minutes of play from $20. I would definitely stay there again, but I would eat and gamble somewhere else. The last reason is because the door of the room are paper thin! I couldn't hear a thing through the walls, but every time someone passed by the door you can practically hear them breath. That's not good when you have a bunch of obnoxious drunks trying to find their room! Oh and when last thing, if you stay there, bring a sweater...even in the middle of a heat wave!

I agree with those reviewers that say it is similar to a cruise, however the service is horrible, the staff is unknowledgable about just about everything, and the crowd leaves much to be desired. Check-in has no flow. There are lines but who knows if you are in one that will lead to an actual staff member. Then once you check in, if you ask how to get somewhere within the building nobody seems to know. We asked a young lady how to get back to the hotel from where we were in the shops and she said \"I'm not sure.\" We asked a young man standing by a door how to get to the pool and he pointed us in one direction....which was wrong. When we were led back on the right track it turns out we had to go through the door by which the young man was standing! He held it open for us at least, after having misled us five minutes prior. These were both employees! There were other examples where this happened again and again. Shouldn't employees know the basic geography of their place of employment? When you call any of the restaurants to make a reservation expect the call to be answered by an exasperated individual who will tell you they have no openings for days. When I spoke to the woman who answered the phone at Amada she specifically (and rudely) said \"We have no openings for ANY time tonight\" and hung up. HQ Nightclub is full of Jersey Shore wannabes and that \"fistpump\" racket and the doormen are rude as well. The plus was that we had a nice room with a decent view.

You will not find the shops within the hotel/casino unless you are looking for them, and I guess we were the only ones looking because we were literally the only people in the stores.

The Trop's room are very basic/outdated and can be loud, but when you go downstairs to the main floor it is like you were dropped in the middle of a party. The Revel, on the other hand, has this great hotel space, but there is no life to the hotel/casino. They have restaurants, nightclubs and bars, but some of them you have to really seek out in order to find them. I am not a gambler, but like AC for the beach, shops, restaurants, and nightlife.
