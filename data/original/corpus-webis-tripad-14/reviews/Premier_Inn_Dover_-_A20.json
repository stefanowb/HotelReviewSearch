Also we booked a meal deal and breakfast in the Restaurant next door, (Beefeaters) The first night was really good, the service was excellent and the food was surprisingly good. We had steak and it was very tender. However the next day the experience wasn't so good, different team serving and probably different chef. The restaurant is very tired and shabby looking, I think it has seen better days. We were really looking forward to the nice breakfasts that we've experience before, but was let down a bit by the lay-out and the display of the breakfast. It wasn't very appealing.
