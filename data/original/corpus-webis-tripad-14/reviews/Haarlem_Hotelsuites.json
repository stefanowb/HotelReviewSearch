There are so many good things we can sat about staying here, but we don't want to because if they become too popular we might struggle to book again. So go stay somewherelse! Besides the stairs were very steep, the bed was very soft and that bathroom door just didn't close properley. So you really wouldn't fancy it now, would you? So I wouldn't stay there if I was you!

It's an absolute gem - spacious, pristinely clean and comfortable, with modern furnishings in a quirky building. There is everything you could want in the kitchen, and the bedrooms are most comfortable. It is warm and cosy too. A particular strength of HotelSuites is the quality of the staff - helpful, friendly, genuine and prepared to offer advice about where to eat and what to see.
