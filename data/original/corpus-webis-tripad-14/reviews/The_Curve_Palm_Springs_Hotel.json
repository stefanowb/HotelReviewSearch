When the Ace Hotel was asking around $175/nt for same, I figured this was worth giving a try.

At around 12:10 p.m., I received a call from the desk clerk demanding to know why we hadn't checked out yet. I told her that the night clerk had promised us a 1 p.m. check-out. She immediately barked, \"Who did you talk to? What was her name?\" I said I didn't know, but it was a woman who was working the night desk shift. She then launched into a 5 minute tirade that started with \"Well, there is nothing noted in the computer and I have a full hotel tonite and need everyone checked out already.\" When I, once again, told her that we had been promised by an employee a 1 p.m. check-out and that we weren't trying to shirk our check-out time (and that I was standing in a towel), she reiterated that she had \"no record\" of my request and she needed me out of the room IMMEDIATELY.
