All sorts of noise I guess must be pump working as it appears everytime you uses the tap. The carpet is terribly stained and they don't even provide house slippers! The room that we were given had a curtain that somewhat didn't reaches the floor and you get the glare from the outside which is a busy street. We ask for a double and guess what a double means two single bed pushed together! I now moved to the cafe. The seats are all badly stained. Breakfast is passable. The choice is not too bad just that they are either lukewarm or cold saved for the hot soya milk which is good. The reception service is alright.
