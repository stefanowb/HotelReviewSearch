Bed and Breakfast only, no evening meal. Breakfast was very good. I found the place lacked atmosphere compared to other Guest Houses, mainly because of the obsence of staff. We stayed three nights, but never saw the owners, and only saw the manager on arrival and departure. This is a very personal opinion, which others probably would not find to be a problem. Should you wish to fish, there is good fishing off of the beach right below the Guest House.

Very friendly welcome on arrival. Excellent breakfast. Secure garage parking. A point to mention though is that there are no bars or restaurants within easy walking distance so you need your own transport, or the services of Andr\u00e9 can be booked for the short taxi ride into town.
