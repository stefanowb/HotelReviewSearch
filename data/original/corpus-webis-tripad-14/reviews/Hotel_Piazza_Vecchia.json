Bergamo is truly a gem of a city and this hotel is superly placed to explore it. Parking is a little tricky, we didn't realise that we could even pull up outside the hotel and by chance ended up in a car park where a helpful attendant told us what to do. To be fair, the fact that you are allowed to park for free in one of the most central locations in the city is a bonus, and the hotel will give you a voucher to place in front of your car which you can then leave for the whole of your stay. It is a 5 minute walk from the hotel to the nearest car park and yes the streets are cobbled but it is part of the charm and if you are not up for some walking when visiting Bergamo then you have come to the wrong place!", "title": "Beautiful hotel, perfect location, exquisite city", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CLM78", "date": "July 5, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 69801770}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel owners are really friendly and did their best to make us feel at home despite the language barrier (which was totally our own fault given our appallingly limited Italian).

Come here and you will be transported back in time to a beautiful medieval town. Stay at the Hotel Piazza Vecchia and enjoy--for the most part--modern conveniences, a comfortable bed, a great shower, and a good breakfast (apparently improved since some negative reviews of past years) all in the very heart of the Citta Alta. What more could one want? Well, one could want air conditioning on a hot day that actually works. We stayed in room 12, a top level room that cost 180 euros with payment required in advance of arrival. There was an air conditioning control that at first appeared to work. But I could never get it to set below 25C, or 77 degrees F. When I inquired I was told that the A/C was adjustable, but only between 25C and 32C. \"You cannot change it because it is set by the computer,\" I was told. Give me a break!!! I was certainly happy to know that I could opt for setting the A/C at 90F! And just who sets the computer other than management? Fortunately, late in the day of the one day we were there, storms in the distance blew some cooler breezes, so we opened the door to the balcony and the small window that looked out to the mountains and were able to cool the room down for a while. But when we went to sleep, we closed the door and the window since we had heard so many stories and about mosquitoes and other insects in Italy coming into rooms at night. And by next morning the temperature in the room was again 77 degrees.", "user": "gaz65", "date": "July 28, 2009", "id": 36038124}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful renovated palazzo", "text": "We just spent 3 days in Bergamo at this hotel.

The location is absolutely fantastic - literally on one of the most beautiful and bustling little streets in the old town and just steps from Piazza Vecchia and lots of lovely restaurants. When we arrived we were greeted by the young lady who I gather is the owner's daughter. She was polite if rather cold and showed us to our room without ever really smiling or asking us anything. No problem at all though, to be honest we're not ones for chatting to everyone on holiday and this didn't really bother us. We also didn't have breakfast owing to reviews so can't comment on that. When the time came for checking out this time the older man dealt with us and processed our payment, again without a flicker of a smile or a question as to whether everything was OK. We then had to get someone's attention (which took some time) to ask where we could leave our bags as our plane didn't leave until later. None of this really bothered me and we put it down to surliness. When we came back to get out bags however we were really annoyed. I wanted to ask the young woman to call us a taxi as there didn't seem to be too many about on a Sunday but she was just stood behind reception gossiping on the phone. We waited three or four minutes in front of her and she showed no sign at all of getting off the phone. So I said 'excuse me' and she put her fingers to her lips. I then heard her muttering on the phone about the 'inglese'. That was just too much so I started to ring the little reception desk bell in front of her which after about 5 rings and lots of hurrumphing from her finally seemed to do the trick and she reluctantly stopped her call. All this was rather ridiculous but it does sum up the total lack of concern that this hotel has for its guests. The staff remind me of staff in a Communist hotel in the 70s who have no interest or motivation to do their job. All very odd when the refurbishment as others have said is really quite nice. Our king size room was massive with a good 4 poster bed and a nice shower. It certainly wasn't luxurious but it was comfortable though a bit cold with the stone, uncarpetted floors and the lack of heating.", "user": "libero7", "date": "October 6, 2008", "id": 20656237}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Magic holiday.", "text": "Despite my comments I would irritatingly stay here again simply because it is clearly the best hotel in a woefully under-served old town - we were so pleased we stayed in the old town as while the lower town is perfectly nice it is nowhere near as beautiful and the restaurants aren't as good.

The hotel's location is great, in the centre of the high town of Bergamo, right on a beautiful little winding street full of restaurants and small shops. The service was good, the girl who served us on the front desk spoke very good English (although the older man who I believe is the owner spoke very little English). We stayed in one of the cheaper comfort rooms, which was a very decent size and had a very modern stylish bathroom, and flat screen tv. The only thing missing was tea and coffee making facilities, but as we had breakfast included it wasn't really a problem. Breakfast was more than adequate, with croissants, tea/coffee, juice, a selection of cereal, yoghurt, bread and a variety of jams, cheeses and salami. Overall, we found the hotel clean, spacious and stylish, and good value for money, and would definately stay there again.
