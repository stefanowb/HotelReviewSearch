The hotel itself has small rooms and looks as if it is for travellers only - i.e. people staying only one night before moving on. There is not much else around and we decided to eat in the hotel which we found to be extortionate. The hotel is clean and tidy befitting a Holiday Inn but unless we travel from Manchester Airport again will probably not return. Best bit is the coach service to the airport - a regular and very efficient service and drivers helpful", "user": "Wanzebra2", "date": "May 26, 2007", "id": 7700404}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Lovely Stay", "text": "We decided to book this hotel on the last minute as we had a flight early the following morning. Having used Holiday Inns before, and considering the price \u00a349 for the room, and the fact that we could leave our car there for an extra night for just \u00a38 we decided to book, as it would have cost nearly \u00a340 just for the airport long stay car park.", "user": "lnt999", "date": "May 25, 2007", "id": 7695400}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "The parking was great", "text": "The room was very comfortable with the usual facilities you might expect but for convenience we also decided to have dinner for 2 at \u00a315 each and breakfast for \u00a310 for the both of us. This actually ended up being cheaper than booking a dinner bed and breakfast deal. Both the dinner and breakfast were very nice and it was the perfect start to what turned out to be a very good weekend.", "user": "Duncans", "date": "March 13, 2007", "id": 7153606}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not Nice and Not Near Airport", "text": "The staff were very friendly and pleasant and I will certainly consider using this hotel next time I fly from Manchester Airport, which, actually, might not be too long off.", "user": "Historiana", "date": "January 27, 2007", "id": 6705362}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "excellent stay", "text": "My husband is quite particular about his precious car, so we were a bit concerned about leaving it at the airport for the first time (having heard the horror stories on Watchdog). We need not have worried. Check-in was a bit slow as there were a lot of people waiting and only one person on reception, however we were given instructions on where to park the car and how to get into the car park which was well lit and had ample spaces with two barriers to go through.", "user": "barton77", "date": "January 12, 2007", "id": 6582332}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Insecure carpark", "text": "Room was fine and teamaking facilities and toiletries were welcome.
