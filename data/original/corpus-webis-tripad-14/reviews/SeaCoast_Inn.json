The property owners/managers, Al and Terri, are fantastic hosts. They make you feel like family and welcome you with open arms! As soon as we arrived, they were gracious enough to check us in quickly and offer us beverages after our long trip. They were an absolute wealth of information all week long, and they provided us with a large assortment of maps, dining guides, and even their own personal copy of a regional atlas that we could take with us on our travels around the Cape. They were very helpful with scheduling ferry trips and a whale watch cruise for us. Breakfast was simple but always fresh and filling, and they're quick to refill anything that runs out! Our best part of the trip was undoubtedly the meal that they generously offered to cook for us following our striper sportfishing adventure. We came home with 30 (?) lbs of striped bass, and they not only offered to fillet, package, freeze, and store it for us while we enjoyed our vacation, but one evening they even cooked it for us, along with some tasty side dishes! How great is that?!? You won't find that anywhere else! At the end of the week, they even packaged the frozen fish in a cooler for us to take home, along with giving us a nice little gift bag of mints for our return journey.", "title": "Wonderful stay, excellent hosts!", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "katemax", "date": "September 15, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 8721165, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The hosts were excellent!
