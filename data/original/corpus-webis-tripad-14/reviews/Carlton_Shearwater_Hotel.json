On check-in, we went to our room to find the bed unmade and wet towels on the floor and table. Rang down to reception to tell them and they made only a cursory apology and told us to come down again to reception to get a new room, which was annoying-they should have met us at a new room rather than us trekking all around the hotel with our suitcases.Then they didnt even allow us to skip the long queue of wedding guests waiting to check-in. The service from the girl on the desk was unfriendly and harried-they should have had more people on at such a busy time so it wasn't fully her fault. Then in the new room there were no toiletries so we had to embark on a mission to get them.Other little niggles were the nice cosy bar being locked for the duration of the wedding with the only option for a quiet drink being in the big, brightly lit sports-bar with big screens blaring.Also, at breakfast, when I pointed out to the waiter that we would probably need another pot of tea-there was one smallish pot between three- he replied in a really argumentative voice that the pot held enough for three. Sure enough, when we wanted more tea, there were no staff to be seen so we had to get up and find a waiter who seemingly promised to get some but walked around for ages doing nothing and never brought the tea..None of these things are a big deal on their own but all add up to a below par experience for the price.

Hotel is very large and was extremely bust when we were there however was very enjoyable and great for the kids. The swimming pool was brilliant which they loved and they also did a kids club 2 nights whereby they did supervised swimming, arts & crafts, dinner time and then DVD. This really made the trip for my kids. The food was really good in the bar and very reasonably priced. The only downside was the heat in the bedrooms, although there was air con it wasnt great and didnt make that much of a difference, and to open the window you could then hear all the noise from the function rooms. However working in hotels I know that this is part & parcel of hotel life during the summer months, it wouldn't put me off returning.
