It helped that the weather was fantastic 22 degrees and very sunny for most of our stay something we didn't expect for the middle of March . The hotel was modern yet comfortable and the breakfast was brilliant catering for all tastes [ they will cook any eggs to order if you ask ]. I especially liked the great selection of fresh fruit .

Staff were very friendly and genuine. On arrival you are offered free memebrship of a discount scheme, 10% off everything you put on your tab, but as this appears available to all guests, why not automatically give discount once you sign for a bill to your room? Strange set up but welcome nonetheless. Food was excellent and although we were not on half board we had dinner there 8 out of our 14 nights. Service was very good but on occasions the restaurant was slow when it was only just moderately busy. Thought that it was a little much staying at a lovely hotel and having to pay extra for the tennis but I just read that this is down to the fact that the spa etc is run as a separate business.
