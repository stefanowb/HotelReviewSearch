We are a family with 4 children from 3 to 15 and we love this place. When we first went we had the family duplex rooms which have an upstairs bedroom for the children as well as an extrea bathroom which is a wonderful benefit when getting ready. Now though, we are too big for a duplex and have interconnecting rooms. My husband and I have one and the four children share the other (with 2 put up beds). We all have plenty of space and again 2 bathrooms for getting ready. Every year we go we have more fun than the last time, I'm in the process of booking again. Sun always shines, foods fab, staff can be so friendly (odd grumpy one) and a real chance to dress up in the evening and sit outside and soak up the atmosphere. All my children are happy here and they're happy, I'm happy. As we have been before we now know some of staff and we have been treated amazingly. In some ways I don't want to give a good review as I'd rather keep this place a secret so it doesn't get too crowded!!", "title": "Fifth Time and Still Fabulous!!!!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "PeterboroughSeda", "date": "June 26, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33222803}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I had to write a review after reading all the bad reviews on this site.", "title": "very enjoyable holiday", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "bobbi71", "date": "June 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 32628001}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Ok this was a one week last minute holiday and we got a really good deal so as long as the weather was good and the accomodation was ok I think I would have been happy.", "title": "brilliant hotel for families", "user": "bubbles060", "date": "June 12, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 32160414}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Remember people 5 star is about the amount of facilities not neccessarily about people waiting on you hand and foot and being treated like a godess!!!", "title": "Great facilities excellent staff relaxing holiday", "user": "MissBuffy", "date": "June 11, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 32122947}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "We arrived at the hotel and were amazed and highly amused with how creative the hotel chain had been with this creation of topkapi and Kremlin palace.

We could not find one thing to complain about and although I am sure it is not perfect but I would like someone to point out a hotel that is. We had a lovely, clean room which was basic but with a mini bar that was restocked with beer, pepsi and mineral water and the room was cleaned and tidied every day and there was no sign of mould in the bathroom. Air conditioning good in the day but didn't seem to work quite as well at night. Although i've had better, it was cool enough to get some sleep. We had two single beds and we pushed them together the first night. The next day the lady had made it up into one bed! Main pool loungers seem to get taken very quicky but we always managed to get one when we wanted (although you do have to get up early!) and the relax pool was lovely. Round the main pool there is a very busy activity programme and some watersports such as banana boats are all incluside. I'd recommend the aqua aerobics which was really good fun. If you don't want to be bothered with noise, music and people trying to get you to join in then the relax pool is the place for you! We really enjoyed the wave pool and the beach is gorgeous- clean and safe even though the sea is deep. Lovely pier to walk along and pavillions you can book which are waitered serviced.
