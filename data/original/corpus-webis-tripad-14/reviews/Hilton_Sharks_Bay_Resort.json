If you are expecting the usual standard of a Hilton four star then you may be a little disappointed as its perhaps not as plush and sophisticated as the hiltons you may stay on business. However, what you do get is a hotel that is geared up to providing a superb holiday. The staff make your holiday and they get to know you from day one.

There was lots of food to choose from so I can only assume that those who complained about the food might be a little fussy. There are always salads, fresh fruit and vegetables available. Yes, their carvery is a little unorthodox (cutting up a duck with a pair of giant scissors doesn't make it look that tasty!)

Not in the least. I was very surprised that they didn't have a \"beach\" really, more like constructed areas with sand. It wasn't bad as our room was on the ground level and we had a small patio that over looked one of the lesser populated pools. The food was okay, if I had had to buy it each night I would not have been happy. It helped that it was a beautiful resort and the staff was top notch and saw to my every comfort. It is nice to walk/swim up to a bar and have the bartender know exactly what you want without even asking! The diving staff was wonderful and they were great to make sure we all saw the little things around the shore. I wish they had not cancelled the boat dive the one day I decided to go but that is life. We couldn't have ordered better weather, the sun was shining every day and we had nice cool nights. For being so close to the airport (I read about that but was surprised at how close) we didn't hear any planes flying in and out. The construction next door was a bit of a pain because they were breaking up rocks constantly but you did get used to it rather quickly, luckily. This was supposed to be a relaxing vacation, we both work very hard and wanted a place to do nothing, and that is exactly what we did. Nothing. Looking back we probably should have gone to one of the dinners in the tents but I guess that means next time we will be sure to see more of the sights around town. It was a beautiful hotel, beautiful warm friendly people, beautiful warm skies and it was a great vacation.

Having read some of the food reports about this hotel, I was a little concerned, but quite confident that we would find something that everyone could eat. Do not expect a hotel with posh meals and waiter service. This is a place where you stand in a queue with a plate in your hand and you pick what you want. This gives you the advantage to try as many things as you want and go back and get more of the food you like. I'm not a big eater, but I found the food all very good, especially the outside area with the curries (a choice of lamb, chicken and veggy usually), plus succulent chicken tikka and shish kebabs....delicious. I understand that this is new and experimental, but it was very popular and sure to take off. The dishes were all mild, but if you ask for extra chilli, they'll chop some up and bring it to you on a plate to sprinkle on top. If you don't like curry then don't panic, the Il Rustico restaurant has a good atmosphere and the chefs will create lovely pizzas and pasta to order, so if your kids don't like 'sauce', you can get them to rustle up a plain dish for the kids, or a simple margarita pizza. The pizza bases and pasta are all freshly made and the pizzas are cooked while you watch. Upstairs is the Mahfouz restaurant. This is the main restaurant and the place where you will get your breakfast. The breakfasts at all of the Hiltons in Egypt are great with a huge choice and very efficient egg chefs and pancake and waffle chefs. The choice of cereals isn't fantastic, but is definitely adequate. You will definitely find something you like. At night there is a large array of stainless serving dishes.
