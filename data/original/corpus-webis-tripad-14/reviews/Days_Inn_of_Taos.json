The room was clean and comfortable (although the bathroom was small). Did not partake of their continental breakfast, but by the smell, someone had burned something pretty badly (owners? guests?)

The air conditioner/heater filter in my room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a year. I rinsed it out in the bathtub and all was fine.

We checked in and went to our rooms, the room was VERY cold when we entered and from working in the hospitality industry previously I checked out the room. In the bed when I pulled back the sheets I found LOTS of hair, yes it looked like pubic hair all over the sheets along with a clipped toe nail. I went and got new sheets from the front desk, and he did not even offer to come change them or have someone come change them for me. The sheets were not wrapped in plastic like they should have been to keep them clean. So I went back to the room and changed the sheets myself, this set was also covered in long black hairs. Instead of going back to the front desk to get more I just shook them off and put them on the bed anyway because my family and I were exhausted from a day of traveling. The king size bed was very hard and made for a very uncomfortable night of sleep. The breakfast was worthless and there was not even any milk for the cereal that they provided. This may be a cheaper hotel...but here you sure get what you pay for....NOTHING!! I would NOT suggest that anyone stay there, especially with children.
