It is a small hotel with an excellent restaurant. Our room was spacious, immaculate and there was always a mosquito coil on our deck each night. Since there was no tv in our room, we were very pleased with the excellent reading lights both by the bed and on the deck. The staff were terrific! We enjoyed lovely breakfasts and dinners on the halfboard plan. We like our food spicy and the cook responded with lovely seafood, fish, curries...even Sri Lankan style breakfasts for us. We are English Canadians but most of the other guests were German speaking . The staff speak excellent English and are very helpful and low key.

Despite our late arrival, Chan made sure the kitchen stayed open so we could have a late dinner. He even took us to our room without a formal check-in because he could tell we were exhausted. The room (Deluxe room...overlooking pool) was great...especially considering the price. Huge modern bathroom, high ceilings, ocean views on our huge balcony...everything one could expect. The next morning we finally had a look around and could not have been happier. The new restaurant pavillion is very nice and also gives diners ocean views. The food we had was very, very good...especially the seafood (try the lobster and tiger prawns!). The wait/kitchen staff was great about taking into account any special requests and could not have been any friendlier. We spent most of the day at the beach where the Wunderbar staff kept an eye out for our beverage needs and one of the guys even climbed a 50 foot palm tree to get a coconut for my girlfriend for fresh coconut water.
