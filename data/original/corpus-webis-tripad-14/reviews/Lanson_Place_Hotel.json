A generous workspace and a sofa setting with a dvd player along with a kitchenette could well make you stay there as long as you want! The breakfast though is disappointing. There is no restaurant as such but the lobby is very contemporary and a nice place to hang around. Its quiet and yet has a buzz. The location is great given a short walk to the subway, restaurants and shopping of CAuseway Bay.", "title": "Home in a hotel!", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "MumbaiAesthete", "date": "April 20, 2009", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28401642, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The rooms", "disliked": "\u2014 Lack of choice of food and breakfast"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is located just across the road from Regal Hong Kong where the airport shuttle stops so it is very convenient. We were in a Grand Luxe room which was very comfortable, modern and had a well thought layout. There was also a basket which contained 1 box of free local biscuits and free drinks( 2 bottles of mineral water & 2 bottles of juice). The mineral water was replenished daily. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. The only complain was that the single ash tray provided in the room was although stylish but ridiculously small. Perhaps more & bigger ash trays could be practical.", "title": "Lived Up To Its Ranking", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "tripkaki", "date": "April 17, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 28186778}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at Lason Place for around 4 nights and loved it becuase:", "title": "Highly recommended - small boutique hotel, excellent service", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "mimandpetebunny", "date": "April 7, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 27574483}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "1.
