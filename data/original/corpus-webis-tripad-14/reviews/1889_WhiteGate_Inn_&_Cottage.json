Their staff was professional and courteous. The Inn and our room, Dorothy Parker, was perfect. We were unsure if we wanted the formal nature of the sit down breakfast, but loved the conversation and entertainment. Very nice touch. Ralph gave us dedicated time in the garden where we shared plant stories and interests.

The room was gorgeous and super-comfortable. The house is beautiful, and the gardens are amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the food is delicious --they were kind enough to accomodate our special dietary requirements. The location is also great -- walking distance to downtown and restaurants. The adorable corgis are a delight (the come for brief visit after breakfast). We've stayed at a lot of B&Bs and White Gate Inn is right up at the top of the list.

We couldn't have selected a better place to stay for 3 nights. The company was congenial and the rooms were excellent, albeit on the older side. The rooms had all the amenities of home, and maybe even moreso. The three breakfasts we ate were all fixed with great care, well cooked and presented by Frank and his staff. The afternoon gatherings in the garden with wine and snacks also were excellent. The location, within walking distance of down town Asheville, also was perfect for our interests for this weekend.", "title": "We give it top marks", "user": "gthayer", "date": "September 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 176309714}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "We will be back.", "title": "A lovely, warm Inn.", "user": "Debbie O", "date": "August 19, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 172955504}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "Don't hesitate to book this lovely accommodation as your home away from home.
