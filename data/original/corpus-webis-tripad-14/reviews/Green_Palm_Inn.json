Everyone had such great things to say about it, we thought we could not go wrong, and we were not disappointed. It is so nicely decorated and just as pretty as in the pictures on the inn website. We stayed in the Royal Palm Suite, which is HUGE! In-room fridge stocked with water and tea, two fireplaces, comfy bed, jetted tub. Diane, the owner, truly made us feel so comfortable (a B&B with only 4 rooms put us a little out of our comfort zone, so we were a bit nervous, but we felt right at home). She is an awesome cook, and we didn't think about food again until after 3:00 we were so stuffed. The snacks available any time of day were much appreciated by my sweet-aholic husband. Diane put out wine and other snacks in the evening, but if you missed it while you were out, you're free to hit the fridge when you get back and pour yourself a glass - loved that, since we are usually out all day and don't come back until late. I don't usually take the time, but I felt compelled to write a review, we liked this place so much.

Diane instantly made us feel at ease and gave us several suggestions for dinner on our first night. Her breakfasts were hearty and delicious. Her blueberry bread pudding is amazing! Diane is also very knowledgeable about Savannah, and helped us choose the best way to go about our sightseeing during the course of our stay. The Inn is in the city's historic district and we found it within easy walking distance of most of the district's must-see destinations.
