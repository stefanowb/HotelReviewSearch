As others have said, the key characteristics of the rooms are size (small but ok), cleanliness (excellent), and age (brand new). Although the room was on the small size, the bathroom was roomy, particulary the shower. Overall the renovation has been carried out well. Also, it was nice to see an ascenseur when we were allocated a 2nd floor room!", "title": "Good place to stay if you're cycling the Canal du Midi", "user": "dg74", "date": "June 6, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 163179047}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "As we were taking a \"rest day\" we ate both lunch and dinner at the hotel's restaurant.

Indeed, service was both friendly and efficient. At dinner I had cuisses de canard, another local specialty, while my wife had fish (can't remember which kind). Both were cooked perfectly and were full of flavour.
