The front desk staff spoke very good English and was fun, though they didn\u00b4t always provide the best information on buses, tours, etc. The hostel itself is situated in an old mansion and has old creaky wooden floors, which are kind of charming. The building is failry large and has several dorms, a couple of double rooms and one triple. The bathrooms were clean enough and there were several scattered throughout the hostel, though the shower stalls are located outside the main building through the kitchen, which is a little wierd because people are walking through the kitchen in towels when you are trying to prepare food, oh well. The kitchen is well outfitted with 8 burners and plenty of utensils. The fridge is a bit small for al of the travelers\u00b4food that was being stored. Great location unless you're 21 and want to drink and party every night, in which case an HI hostel would better suit you. Breakfast is pretty decent as it offers cereal and pastries. We took the horseback riding tour which was really fabulous....a full day in the Andes on horseback followed by a great bbq. Would definitely stay again.", "title": "Great Hostel in a Gret City", "user": "LuvSLO", "date": "May 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 30557497}], "location": {"country": "Argentina", "region": "Cuyo", "continent": "South America"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 6, "very good": 12, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 29}, "slim_ranking": 0.147826086957, "description": "The New Owner has over 30 years of travel experience and really understands what nowadays travelers are looking for.Hostel Independencia is located in the heart of downtown Mendoza, few steps from the Independencia Square, the center of concerts, recreational and cultural activities.
