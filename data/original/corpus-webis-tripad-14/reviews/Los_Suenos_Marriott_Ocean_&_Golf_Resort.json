When we checked in, they informed us they were upgrading us to a better room. I couldn't believe the room they put us in--a suite overlooking the ocean, with each room having cathedral ceilings and a private balcony. Just gorgeous! We stayed there two days and truly enjoyed the luxury. I had been warned that the beach there was not the best (which it isn't), but the resort makes up for it. The pool was wonderful, with live entertainers and a swim up bar/restaurant with reasonable food. We didn't actually give that much business to the hotel, as we never made it to the casino or ate in any of the restaurants (other than one in-room dining experience). The room, however, was to die for (and I have stayed in lots of very nice hotels). All of the staff we dealt with were quite friendly. I can't speak to the normal rooms at the resort, but we truly had a wonderful experience there. Would highly recommend the resort. Also had a great breakfast one morning at a nearby high-end luxury B&B--?Carreta. Great views and a really relaxing breakfast.", "title": "Relax in luxury", "helpfulness": 14, "user": "Fridaysmom", "date": "October 4, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 3992904}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Beautiful Resort", "text": "Los Suenos is a beautiful resort with a hacienda flair. If you are looking for nightlife, it is not the place for you. It is a wonderful venue for quiet evenings after a day of adventure touring CR. The breakfast buffet was delicious and extensive. The staff was accommodating and friendly. Poolside service was slow and nonexistent at times, but the swim up bar made up for it. Cocktails at US prices. We didn't eat at the restaurants as we preferred dining in Jaco and experiencing local cuisine. Our favorite was the Taco Bar that serves fresh fish tacos with a wonderful salad bar. Spa services were more expensive than I pay in Washington, DC. Beautiful golf course, although we are not golfers. I had to visit the local clinic on our 1st day which was located outside of the resort entrance. Very nice doctor and antibiotics at the pharmacy in town are cheap and plentiful. Tours are expensive so we opted to rent a car and make the adventure ourselves. Roads are poor and signs minimal, so bring a map. 90% of the people in the resort areas speak English. In the smaller towns they don't. Please respect their country and language and learn some basic Spanish or at least bring a translation book. If you are looking for a beach vacation, this one is only for surfers. Not pretty, but rocky and black sand. No need for nice clothing, comfortable t-shirts and shorts, old sneakers and sandals will do. We would definitely stay here again. The resort is Americanized for us spoiled Americans, but the country is not.

Swimming in the ocean was fun...and the brown sand washes away the same as the light brown...it's not dirt as I've read in other reviews. The rooms and architecture are first rate.
