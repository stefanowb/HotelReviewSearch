Our room was on the ground floor and opened to the garden - very quiet. The room was very large. It was like a suite, having living and bedrooms. The bed was great and had a trundle bed underneath. It was clean. We did not do breakfast. The hotel's restaurant was great- excellent food and presentation for such a low price. Staff was friendly. The pool was ok. Parking underneath in the garage was expensive. The hotel was only a 10 min walk from the Palais and 5 min from the main drag that had some great restaurants.", "title": "Pretty Nice Hotel", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "capturedplanet", "date": "August 14, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 3761540}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great location, great price", "text": "This hotel was perfectly located for sightseeing in Avignon and the staff was very helpful.
