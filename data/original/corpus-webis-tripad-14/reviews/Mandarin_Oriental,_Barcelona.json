Maria , at the front desk, is lovely, charming, and nothing is a problem for her. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the next category of room - thanks to the American Express Platinum Card. Lovely, or so I thought. Maria mentioned that the 7th floor room would be facing the back of the hotel, and its courtyard. Ever so graciously, she indicated that the room we were originally booked in had a wonderful view of La Rambla. Yes, the 7th floor upgrade was roomier and had a full balcony, but the view was of the back of other apartments and it was too high up to benefit from the courtyard gardens. Not too charming. So I chose the original room on the second floor. While smaller, it was perfectly appointed and decorated in such a manner as to minimize the size of the room. I loved being able to hear and see what was happening below on such a busy street during the day with the windows open.
