First the positive: the people at the front desk tried to be helpful, but were hampered by the lack of resources they had. The biggest problem with the hotel is the early 90s technology. No wi-fi in the rooms, but they say it is available in the lobby. IF you can get it to work in the lobby, it is as slow as molasses and frequently cuts out. They front desk suggested sitting nearer the router, so I cozied up to the 2 computers available in the lobby. No luck. I switched from Ipad to one of their computers and it was still terribly slow. It was a step back in time. Next up, we needed a map. Doesn't every hotel have a map of the city? No, this one doesn't. They did have directions to the rental car return that someone with the hotel had written up, Every Word Helpfully Capitalized -- Poorly Written And Just Plain Wrong To Boot. Maid service--they skipped our room. When the very nice maid knocked in mid-morning, we said \"later please,\" she said, \"okay, later\" and we thought we had communicated, but we left shortly thereafter and came back late afternoon and she never came back. Oh, the climate control--not very responsive, but good enough. Breakfast buffet was $10.50, but we had egg and croissant sandwiches at the Dunkin Donuts a block or so away (delicious!) and saved ourselves about $15.

We've stayed at them many times before. Several small issues, nothing terrible, skewed our view of this hotel. When we entered our \"first\" room, we noted hair in the bathtub. Later we tried to lock the door deadlbot and found that we were actually locked in the room. The deadbolt was stuck. One of the maintenance workers freed us, from the outside. We decided to change rooms at that point and when speaking to the desk attendant and the maintenance worker, I mentioned about the hair in the bathtub. The maintenance worker did say he would report it to housekeeping, the desk attendant seemed to have no reaction. In our second room, we noted mold and mildew in the areas where the shower was caulked. In general, areas of the bathroom were dusty and did not look well cleaned. We also found a used small towel hanging from the shower rod. The towels were thin and not of the usual quality we've found at other Marriotts. The common areas, such as the hallway carpets, did not look welll vacuumed. In summary, the hotel looked like a Courtyard, but had more of the feel of the lower budget Fairfield Inn.
