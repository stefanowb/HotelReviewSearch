I arrived at this hotel in Cordoba to be informed when I asked that there was no wireless interent because they were looking for a new provider - ok, so I thought I could then use my backup through dialup, but then, after much discussion, I discovered that tis hotel did not allow guests to dial any freecall numbers and consequently I could not access my ISP through dial-up.

We booked a double on www. booking.com and paid 60 euros. This is not the most charming or unique hotel, and it's definitely not a destination onto itself, but for a tourist or business travel, it's an excellent, excellent value. The room was large and clean and decorated in with a slightly Islamic theme, beds are comfortable, linens are clean, and the bathroom was large and also very clean. We were on the ground floor so they was a faint smell in the bathroom of pipes or sewer but it didn't really bother us that much except that it discourage me from taking a bath in the excellent bathtub. The hotel was well located - you can either take a 7 euros cab from the train station or the bus, which takes about 15 minutes, costs about a euro, and deposits you right by city hall. There are lots of traditional cordoban bars and restaurants within walking distance - we had a memorable and affordable meal at the Taberna Salinas nearby - it was recommended by the friendly staff at the hotel. The \"sights\" of Cordoba (the Mezquita, etc) are a pleasant 15-30 minute walk away, depending on where you want to go and on your pace. The exquisite patios of Palacio de Viana are but ten minutes away and are probably the best 3 euros we spent in Spain. The Mezquita and the Jewsih quarter are further, but it's a fun walk. The hotel has free internt and it looks like there is parking.
