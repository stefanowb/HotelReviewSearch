It was 2 hours from San Francisco and 1 1/2 hours to Yosemite. The Hotel is very nice. The complimentary breakfast was more than expected. The only problem we had was when we were using the business center and made tour reservation that could only be printed once and the printer would not work. I went to the front desk and she said she has asked to get it fixed, but has not been done yet. I advised her she should put a sign on the printer letting others know that it is out of order. I had to redo our tour reservations and wait for a refund for the first request. The rooms are very roomy and clean. Noise was not an issue when sleeping. The wi-fi signal was not very good for our Ipad, so we used a wired computer.

I had never stayed in a Holiday Inn Express but must say I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel was modern and clean, and my room was relatively large with a nice modern bathroom. The free breakfast was great with both hot and cold items. There is an outdoor pool and spa. The fitness room was a little lacking, having no weight equipment, only treadmills. The business center had fast (for a hotel) pcs. The location is quite a ways from Yosemite, as well from many restaurants (other than fast food). There is one upscale Italian restaurant nearby. To get a SD card for my camera I had to go to a Target in the center of Mereced which was about 5 miles away. The hotel is close to rt 99 which is good, but being the signage is poor at the highway exit, I made a wrong turn and it took a while for me to get to the hotel the first time. The residential area to the north also is a bit questionable, so take care if driving through there. I highly recommend the Castle Air Museum which is about 10 miles north of the hotel off 99 in Atwater for those that love seeing historic WWII planes and early jets.
