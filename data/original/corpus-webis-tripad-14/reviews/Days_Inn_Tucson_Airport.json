The rooms were basic but clean, the linen washed and the beds comfortable.

As a bonus it's also fairly close to Tucson Electric Park for Cactus League games.

Aside from that it was pretty quiet. The continental breakfast (basically cereal, coffee, apples) was somewhat unappealing but there is a Waffle House close by. Rates varied (we stayed here at the beginning of our trip and at the end) from $70/night to $100+/night. Make sure to ask for the AAA discount when checking in. We asked the check-in clerk about the difference and was told that the owner/manager sets the room rate depending on demand - if there is an event going on in Tucson the rates will be higher.", "title": "Worst hotel experience in my life!!
