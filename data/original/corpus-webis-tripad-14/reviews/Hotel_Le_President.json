The neighborhood felt fine during the day but at night the street was dark and deserted (not ideal for women travelling alone). Great air-conditioning, small room, but clean. The hallways in the hotel are quite dark and do not have automatic sensor lighting.", "user": "boonyc", "date": "August 7, 2006", "id": 5575779}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Midi-Pyrenees", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 2, "variance": {"poor": 3, "average": 10, "very good": 5, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 4}, "slim_ranking": 0.647482014388}
