The rooms were bright and large for standard rooms. The beds were very comfortable soft not hard as the others we had stayed in during our three city China tour. There is plenty of shopping around the hotel if you want to pick up water or soft drinks during your stay. The Metro is a short 15 minute walk next to the Science Museum. I recommend the Metro for travel it is quick and efficient and will take you to all the tourist destinations for 4 RMB per person. The taxis are great they are real cheap and start at 11 RMB when you get in. We took the taxi one night to YuYuan Gardens for 21 RMB, that's like $3.50. Make sure you tell the driver to use the meter (Fa Bieu). The staff will write down in Chinese and tell the drivers where you want to go. Make sure you have the name of the hotel with you for the return trip. We did not use the amenities offer at the hotel and dined out every night. The rooms are a great value at $136 dollars per night per room.
