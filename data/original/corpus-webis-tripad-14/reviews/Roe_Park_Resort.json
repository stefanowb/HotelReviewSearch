Hotel good, but on our last day i left my brand new wedding ring in the bathroom after a shower. As we left the cleaners were just about to clean it. Later, when i realised about my ring i phoned management. Needless to say the ring could not be found even though it would stand out like a sore thumb. In addition the staff member gave the distinct impression that he didn't really give a monkey's!! Again, beautiful hotel, just lock everything up or take it with you.
