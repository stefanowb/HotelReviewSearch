We got family jr. suites , which are right by the beach and pool. You cannot go wrong if you end up in buildings 1-3. We were supposed to have buckets and pails waiting in the room as a welcome gift for the kids as part of the family suite booking, but neither our kids or our friends got them after a few calls and promises that they would be sent. There was also a scheduled kid gift/activity scheduled in the children's area that we showed up for, but no one was there. While I never use childcare, our kids did get to sit in on a magic show they had, and I did see the caregivers taking the kids all around the property for lunch, feeding the peacocks, swimming etal. My age ranges were pretty well engaged with the things offered on property as well, but be forewarned you will have to pay for some of the key activities they will want to do. The sky ropes course will cost you 10 bucks American, the Euro Bungy another 6 bucks, figure another 6 bucks for the climbing wall, and there is a huge 2 story slide on the beach that will run you 2 bucks for 3 slides, and they will also take the kids horseback riding for 10 bucks. All those extras initially rubbed me the wrong way since I thought EVERYTHING should've been included in a family ALL inclusive, but what are ya gonna do? Just be ready to pony up at least 32 to 50 bucks per kid if you plan to let them do it all - and they will want to! The only included activities they did were the pedal boats and canoes, which were fun and easy to book. Although there were volleyball nets, they wanted my friend to pay for a ball! I must interject here that Paradisus was superior in this area, as they offered everything from the balls to organizing the games, to basketballs, playing cards, books, etc. You also get free horseback riding, scuba lesson and one free scuba dive there along with all your nonmotorized watersports. We just couldn't go there with our family of five like we could at Melia, or else we would have returned or tried Palma Real, their higher end property located right next to Melia.", "title": "Great 4 family of five", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "mochamommy", "date": "June 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 17101254, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 BEACH", "disliked": "\u2014 Reservations hassle and extra costs for kids activities"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Paradisus has all of its restaurants near the beach, whereas Melia's restaurants are all back at the lobby a good walk away.

Also, at Paradisus my \"hungry man\" was able to order two entrees for dinner, which they would not allow at Melia. And good luck on getting your dinner reservations at Melia. The property was barely half full when we were there, but it was a lot of work to get into a restaurant you wanted versus what they had left by just 9:30 am.

Buffets were great and exactly what we wanted for our morning meal and odd afternoon meal. We couldn't get over the evening atmosphere in and around the main HUB of the resort. It was couples just curled up on lovely chairs for two and privacy for everyone. Peacocks and pink flamingos roamed around the gorgeous tropical setting and fish and swans were a plenty in the two many to count manicured ponds scattered everywhere. Rooms were beautiful, linen was superb, and when you retired to your room it was so quiet because all activity was up at the main buildings. The resort is HUGE, so you have to take a train that was constantly moving around the resort but it only took a couple of minutes for you to get picked up anywhere. The only difficulty ( and only slight) was the communication barrier, not alot of staff ( other then the front desks) spoke much english,. however we always managed to get our point across. One important note, make sure you take enough money with you, the ATM (only one) on the resort was out of money until our last day so we had to go across the resort to the Mall and had abit of problems with the language again at the bank.

Arrived 4/16/06 - departed 4/24/06. Most everything we read ahead of time was very helpful so do your homework. We arrived at the hotel before noon and did not have any problem getting two rooms in a nice area (building 38) half way between the lobbies and the beach. That evening, though, there were people lined up at registration and actually sleeping on the couches in the lobby. Talked to people the next day and heard all kinds of stories about people getting moved around and some did not have any rooms at all. My advice is book a flight that gets you to the hotel early in the day so you don't have to deal with room problems. Yes, there is a lot of walking which was not a problem unless you bring bad shoes/sandals and get blisters on your feet from all the walking. It is too hot to walk bare footed so bring comfortable shoes and enjoy the exercise. Rooms were nice enough, always had towels, no bugs, peacocks make a lot of noise but it was very tropical. Had a small problem with the girl's room. The ceiling leaked on one day but front desk fixed the problem right away. We golfed 5 out of 7 days. Do not bother trying to golf 18 holes. It is too hot even if you start first thing in the morning. The latest tee time for 18 holes in 1:30pm. Instead, ask if you can golf 9 holes. There is a discount rate on carts after 3:00pm. We golfed every day at 3:30 or 4:00, paid $21.00 per person for the cart and only $10.00 for a rider to come with us. Otherwise, before 3:00pm you pay $36.00 per person for the cart even if you are a rider. Make your first reservation on line or call before you leave, then make all other reservations at the golf course. Don't bother going through the front desk or public relations.

Let me start by saying that we were a big group of 13 which can always pose some problems with arrangements. The beach was very nice but vacationers need to be mindful of picking up their stuff since quite often we found plastic cups in the water. That goes for the pool too, as we would find garbage lying around. Our biggest challenges were with the dinner reservations..their system needs a major overhauling..to make reservations for the following nights meal you needed to call starting at 9:00 pm the night before. Each night one of our group needed to remove themselves from dinner to go to the phone in the restaurant and call guest services for reservations..this was not a 5 minute deal..this was a 20-30 minute ordeal since the entire resort with the exception of royal service guests is doing the same thing. We were only able to get reservations to where we wanted on 2 nights the other nights we had to take what was available ..this is a joke..since each night when we walked into the restaurants there were at least 7-8 tables empty. We were informed that the resort holds blocks off a certain number of tables for Royal Service and that you can call back at 1:00 the day of to see if they were taken, if not they are then up for grabs..we tried that on a few occassions, but were still turned away. They also told us that if we showed up at a restaurant without reservations that we would be turned away (with kids..we opted not to try this option). The food was mediocre at best. We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant and the Mexican, however the Italian and the American were not good. We had heard that the French was good too, but again could not get reservations. The buffets were fair at best..The selection of alcohol was minimal and difficult to get a proper drink..my Margarita did not tast like anything close to a Margarita. You could not get premium brand liquor and if you wanted it..their were very few bars that had them and of course we were told that we would have to pay. I didn't see on their website that you would have to pay extra for imported alcohol, same was with the wine..you could get their house wine, but if you wanted a particular bottle off the wine list it was extra. The rooms were decent..when we arrived we were told that we were going to be put in the Family Suites...had I known I would have asked to go into a standard room as the dinasour bones pillows, curtain pulls and, decorations don't exactly do it for me..I get that they were keeping up with the Flintstones theme..but my children who are 7 & 9 don't know the Flintstones (wasn't their era). Our tub was clogged, but they fixed it by the next day. The AC was not strong and I am someone that my husband says is cold in August..so for me to be warm..must say something about the system..may just need an update. Another concern for us was that 3 of the people in our group got swimmers ear..it was mentioned to us that there could be higher level of bacteria in the pool..I don't know enough about swimmers ear to comment on it, but I must admit..I never did smell any chlorine. The activities for the kids cost money..they had a zip line, rock climbing wall and trampolines..again I couldn't find any mention of extra fees on their website, but when we got their they were charges to use it. Overall the place looks tired and could use a bit of a sprucing up. As a group we had fun and laughs, but agreed that this was not a place we would go back to. Several of us also got a stomach bug..but I'm a believer that this can happen anywhere..so I don't attribute that to the place..if that were the case I would end up never leaving the states.", "title": "Did Not Meet Our Expectations", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "vakay", "date": "July 19, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 8192532}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled with family", "text": "whats up fellas? my name is Jason from NYC.

We went there to celebrate my 19th birthday and I had a blast. Melia Caribe is fairly big, but the grounds and landscaping is SOOOOO beautiful, you will hardly even notice the duration of a walk. All the exotic trees, plants, and little animals running around is breathtaking. The water of Bavaro Beach is NIIIIICCCEEE! the water is clear blue and just the feel of it is so smooth to the skin, you have to experience it for yourself of course! Melia has several restaurants and buffets, along with 5 or 6 bars. All the restaurants are excellent, but the best one in my opinion is the French restaurant called Ma Maison (eat the salmon dishes!!) The food is excellent in Melia, the drinks are just as good! The Dominican People are VERY VERY nice, so different from what you find in America! They are always smiling and very friendly! ... The rooms are comfortable and clean, most are spacious...DO NOT forget to catch the shows in the Caribe side of the hotel starting at 10 pm, it is terrific.. all you need for the show is a seat, a nice cold Presidente (dominican Beer)..the drinking and gambling age for that island is 17, so i was made! ...

Now some of your readers may have taken advantage of this but we were leaving in 2 days and did not want to pack up and move. I also do not want a butler lurking around, thank you! They stopped us every opportunity they got. By Friday, our last day, they finally gave up and just asked us to please recommend the resort to people we know. We agreed. So, if you dont mind the time share push, I do recommend this resort. The beach is long and beautiful, the grounds are immaculate and beautiful, the food is great. Theres something for anyone here.

Yes, the resort is physically attractive, nice grounds, rooms, etc, but it's too huge, there's a trolley to take people back and forth from restaurants, rooms, beach, etc. And the rooms are nice too, but that's where the compliments end. First, there is no service, it's non-existent, You ask for towels or for anything, no one shows up until 4 hours later if they show up at all. Next, mgmt sucks, if you ask for a mgr or supervisor to discuss a problem or issue, they say not available or the mgr is just as useless as the person behind the counter. And don't try greasing any palms for better service, we tried and they just took the money and didn't do anything for us. Next, the buffet is disgusting, almost inedible. Then there are like 10 restaurants with different cuisine, all need reservations, but you can only reserve that morning for the same night, so unless you wake up at 7a, you get locked out of the only 2 good restos. The beach sand is like an ashtray, and the water brown and murky. You're bascially stuff in this strange, cheesy all-inclusive world where the only thing to do is drink sugary cocktails. The pool scene is full of fat americans and their loud, fat children. I'm pretty laid back and up for anything, but this place totally disappointed.

We met lots of wonderful people, enjoyed the bountiful buffets, lounged by the pool and made the best of everything. Yes, the service could be slow.

Many people in our group and others from Wisconsin brought along insulated mugs and the bartenders were more than happy to fill them up with whatever drink they ordered. Because we didn't have the insultated mugs, we would sometimes order two drinks each so we didn't have to go back as often. As far as the staff not speaking much English, it was never an issue for us. As long as you attempted to speak a bit of Espanol, they were gracious and accommodating. We found if you tipped the bartenders, you didn't get faster service, just stronger drinks. Which, you did not need as the drinks are alerady made very strong! Be vary careful of the 151 Rum! We found out the hard way the first day there! The bartenders were great at keeping track of the order the customers arrived at the bar and served in that order. We did give out tips our last day to show our appreciation to the bartenders.We left money for housekeeping along with coloring books, markers, crayons and candy for their children. Went to the Dollar Tree before vacation and spent about $13. We also gave some of these items to our favorite cocktail waitress at the lobby bar. Keep in mind the D.R. is a poor country. The average monthy wages are $300 U.S. dollars.

We also didnt have a problem getting reservations at the restuarants either....The food at the buffet was awful lol I was eating mashed potatoes every morning it was the only thing I could find that was good I didn\u2019t really like anything else\u2026One day we went on that $100 per couple boat ride to captain cooks for an unbelievable seafood lunch ! It was well worth the money!

We made friends with all of the bar tenders, the Japanese restaurant was awesome! The dinner was unbelievable and the dessert was even better! We ate at the American grill the second night we were there and it wasn\u2019t that bad the mozzerella sticks were made fresh and they were very good, then I got some chicken teriyaki on skewers that was also good. I think the first night we were there we went to atabales (I don\u2019t remember how it was spelt) but that was a giant buffet and it was ok it wasn\u2019t the best. Capri was great mostly seafood on the menu, the Mexican place was beautiful inside and the food was great as well the only thing was that they only had guacamole sauce and they didn\u2019t have any salsa lol. I cant wait to go again next year! I was so relaxed after this vacation!

Although there are always some logistical issues when accomadating a group as large as ours, the hotel did a good job booking everyone into three blocks of suites. It takes a little getting used to the resort as it is MASSIVE. My recommendation is to try and get a room in block 14, 15 or 16 as it is in the area closest to the pool, beach and breakfast/lunchtime buffets. You only need to go to the front of the resort (about a 15 minute walk from the beach) for the a la carte restaurants (which are awesome). If you are planning a wedding at the Melia you will be very happy with the coordinator team of Angelica and Lori. They will try to sell you many upgrades but rest assured that the basic \"package\" is very nice on it's own. We would recommend choosing the gazeebo for your ceremony instead of the beach asd it gets very windy and there is ZERO privacy for the beach wedding (it is actually set up almost beside the volleyball court!). The gazeebo was a beautiful setting and much more intimate if you are having a group of people. We also recommend \"Ma Maison\" for your wedding dinner. The food was heater.

We were not dissappointed in any way! We chose the resort based on the reviews from this website. It seemed to have the least negative comments compared to some of the other all inclusive resorts that we were looking at. It turned out that we made a great choice! This place reminded me of the show \"Fantasy Island\" from the 80's! It was gorgeous!! If you are looking for a tropical paradise this is the place to go! There were lush gardens everywhere, small ponds with fish and flamingos and plenty of peacocks roaming the grounds! The building that had all of the restaurants and the many lounge areas and bars was beautiful! Especially at night when the lights were dimmed, the smell of insense everywhere, the many lounge beds and light music playing throughout the whole place! It was very romantic! We did not have Royal service, but as soon as we arrived we were treated as if we did. At first I thought they had confused us with Royal Service guests. We were taken to our room by one of the many golf carts, instead of having to wait on a train. We were also set up a dinner reservation for that night at the Japanese restaurant and again dinner the following 2 nights at the Italian and Thai restaurants. We never had a problem getting into any of the specialty restaurants. The food always had a very nice presentation in all of the beautiful restaurants. Everyone talks about the food not being very good, but I had to realize that this is not the \"American\" food that we are used to........it is just different. We as \"Americans\" are spoiled with the foods that we have! Overall we enjoyed most of the food that we ate. My favorite (closest to american food) was the Mexican, Italian and the Japanese. I did miss the dipping sauces that we get here in America at our local Japanese restaurants. We also did a couple of the excursions which was the snorkeling trip on the \"party boat\" where you also got to swim with nurse sharks and stingrays! That was a really cool adventure!

First and foremost its best if you know the Spanish language. Many of the resort employees only speak spanish and know very little english, so bringing a Spanish Dictionary with you is a GOOD idea. All the buildings on the resort are only 2 levels. I STRONGLY suggest you recommend a 2nd FLOOR Suite! The first room we were put into was on the ground floor and in the middle of the property, building 44. There was no action around anywhere it was like it was secluded from all the fun and activities. The room also smelled like mold and there were tiny small red ants crawling on the floor and counters in the bathroom. We used the phone in the hotel room to call the front desk and that was a fiasco. We learned quickly that you can't accomplish anything by using the phones there. Either no one answers, you get an answering machine, OR they don't understand in english what you want. So try to do what you can IN-PERSON at one of the two main lobbies if you have a matter to be resolved. We went back down to the main lobby and demanded another room this time closer to the beach and on the 2nd floor. After about 1/2 hour we got our room and had everything transferred over to building 32. The room was nice and clean, but there were still ants crawling on the floor and counter in the bathroom, so we decided to just live with that for the next week. We realized that after the first night when we didn't leave a tip immediately for the maid, our room wasn't as clean as it was the first night and no animal towel on our bed either the rest of our stay.

We have traveled extensively all over the world and our stay here was wonderful. I was a little bit put off by the bad reviews and decided to upgrade to the Royal Service. We were part of a group of 50 who were there to attend a wedding and only two couples upgraded. We both thought it was well worth doing. Check-in and out were quick. You have a wonderful room, private pool and your own restaurant. Butler service is available and so is room service. We had breakfast in twice and it was great. Our friends had a late night dinner and said that it was great also. We had a few mosquitos in the room, but never got bitten. You are in a tropical location so they are to be expected. I did bring bug spray with us, but didn't use it. The other 48 people in our group were happy with their trip. Even though we had our own pool area every afternoon we would go down to join the group in the pool by the beach. That was a fun pool and quite lively. The pool up in the Royal Service area is a great place to read and just hang out. It does have a bar, but tends to be quiter than the other pools. The grounds are spectacular and well maintained. We tipped a lot, but no one expected it. Oh, the Royal Service has their own beach area with a great bar. The beach is wonderful. We grew up in a beach area so we feel that we could judge that. We did not take any trips off the grounds, but if we did we decided that it would only be half day trips. There were lots of families with kids and all seemed to be having a great time. We walked a lot, by our choice, just to work off all the food and drink that we consumed. The food was very good. We did not get sick. The best in our opinion was The Capri, which is a Mediterranian Restaurant. We ate in groups of 10 and had no trouble getting reservations. We also ate at the French and the Japanese Restaurants and they were good as well. The first night we ate at a buffet and it was good. It wasn't great, but was good. The wedding was spectacular, and the bride and groom had their pictures the morning we all left which was two days after the wedding. Lots of weddings went on while we were there. You can get married on the beach or in this beautiful gazebo if you so choose. One thing the bride and groom found out about the papers is that you will not get your official certificate for a couple of months, so if you need it sooner, I don't know what you would do. They gave them a letter, but I don't know if that would suffice. We had a great, relaxing time and would go back. Bring lots of sunscreen and film. The gift shops were expensive and we did not bargain at the stores on the beach, but some of our group did and they got some nice jewelry.
