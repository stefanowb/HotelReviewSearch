Rhonda touched us with her hospitality by waiting up for our arrival, with her friendly chatter and desire to know more about us and our country and cooking the most delectable breakfast for us. She really lent a personal and very caring touch that we will always remember. Her 2 dogs were absolutely a delight to play with and made us feel like we were back at home with our own dog! The rooms were spacious, very clean and well-furnished and the beds were insanely comfortable. It was a pity that we only stayed at Batemans Bay Manor for a night and we look forward to going there again! :)", "title": "Do yourself a favour!
