He is the very personable and knowledgeable Conference Services Manager and helped us throughout the day. For a reasonable fee we were able to move our lunch set up to the 5th Floor Restaurant since they are closed for lunch. This gave us a wonderful and private room filled with sunlight in which to dine. After a long work day and a dinner at a nearby Peruvian Restaurant I came back to the hotel needing to send an urgent fax. Doma Chonzom was waiting at the front desk ready to greet me with a beautiful smile. She helped ensure my document was printed and then faxed in time. Doma's pleasant speaking voice and friendly demeanor took the edge off my haste and made our interaction a delightful way to end the evening! The food here is delicious and every person I met from Doorman, to Manager, to Service Staff all the way to the end of the evening with Doma was genuine, and calming.
