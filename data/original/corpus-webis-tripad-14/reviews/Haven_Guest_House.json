Whitby is small and picturesque, and actually everything was walking distance. No WiFi here, so went down to the local pub for that.

Parking is the wild card. Don't pay for it, but rather, scout for open spots in front or nearby the hotel, on the street. Then move your car closer. Rules are 'you must only sit at your assigned table for breakfast' (room 2 has the table by the only window). Paypal takes credit cards, but the balance for more outstanding nights must be paid in cash only. 'No takeaway food in the rooms'.
