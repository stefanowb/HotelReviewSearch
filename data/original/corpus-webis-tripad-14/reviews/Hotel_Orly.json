However, I was given room # 13, which sits adjacent to the stairwell, where people descend as if they were cattle, particularly in the morning. Unless you like being awakened in this manner, and you do decide to stay at the Orly, BY ALL MEANS do NOT stay in room 13. The room itself is also very very tiny (to give you an idea, the bathroom door doesn't even open completely and I couldn't even put a mat on the floor to do Pilates.
