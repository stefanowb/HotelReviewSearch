I know this because people on my tour started going room to room just to check out what other people had. My room had extremely high cathedral ceilings & a HUGE window & really large armoire. My mom's room had a step-down from the front door area, wood flooring, and a canopy bed. My sisters room was so different! When you opened the door you'd have to go up an entire flight of stairs and then at the top was a small sitting area and a bedroom behind curtains! So cool! And, of course, the tower at the top is amazing for views. I'm attaching some of the pics I took from the top of it.
