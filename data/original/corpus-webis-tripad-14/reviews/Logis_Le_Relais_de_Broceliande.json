Our room, a superior, was on the second floor and was very bright and nicely decorated. The bathroom consisted of a very modern Jacuzzi bath and separate shower. The toilet was in a separate room. Breakfast was good, croissants, fruit, soft boiled eggs. Dinner was very regional and nicely presented. As we were demi pension we had the appropriate menu the first night and paid extra the second night to enjoy the top choices. The staff were very good and cheerful. If we are in the area again we would certainly not hesitate to stay there again.", "title": "A good place to stopover", "user": "Sauvarin", "date": "July 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 166406205}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We were travelling with a small dog and the the dog was very welcome in this place, We paid extra for it, but this is normal almost everywhere.", "title": "Great location to discover Bretagne", "user": "Aerolita", "date": "October 8, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 142289434}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Ideal for a relaxing break", "text": "We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights.
