We booked the Sunday night Spa package - \u00a3189 for 2 people, this includes double room with sea view, all day use of pool, jacuzzi/hot tub etc, 3 course evening meal, breakfast and 2 hours of treatments. We arrived at 11.30 and went in the bar for lunch and drinks we hoped seeing as our spa day started at 10am that we may of had our room ready before 2pm so that we could settle in, bit that was disappointingly not possible. The pool and steam room and hot tub are lovely, and changing rooms clean although over flowing with finished towels. Really disappointed that there were no loungers by the pool to lie and chill and read. We went up to have treatments facial which was very good and Leanne was very lovely. My partner had a massage which he said was fantastic. We went into the relaxation room but this is up on the third floor ~ pool is on ground floor , and all beds were in use which meant the whole day at the spa I had no where to lie down and read. The cocktails were not cheap but tasted amazing. The lunch was lovely, and evening meal was good. However, they had run out of all roast dinners and the pork loin and my partner would of loved a pasta dish but they only had pasta with fish on the menu. Also the special dessert had run out. The food we had was nice but my deep fried Brie had to be returned as was chilly in the middle. Breakfast was buffet and cooked which was really nicely cooked. All staff were helpful and friendly in all departments. Room was fantastic, modern and had a large bathroom up some steps from the bedroom with patio doors to a balcony. Stunning view of fistral beach from the balcony and in the bath!! Unfortunately the sea kept me awake but that's just me! The bed was lush comfortable.

Obviously this is a security risk as we had left valuables in our room, fortunately nothing was taken, but I then felt it was unsafe and had to drag stuff about with us.
