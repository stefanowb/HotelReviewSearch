I'd hate to be in the rooms next to the elevator & vending machines, but our room was upstairs at the far end from reception. The room was OK - bed was comfortable enough, coffee machine worked - and wasn't particularly expensive, especially given that it was a Saturday night on the coast. Heating was a bit strange - the room had an electric heater controlled by a wall thermostat so you can just dial in the temperature you want, but a modern air conditioning unit would be much better.", "title": "Not great but not terrible", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "splicha", "date": "November 5, 2006", "detail_rating": {"value": 3.0}, "id": 6060553}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great Location, Good Value", "text": "Location is good - you can walk to Monterey Aquarium along the shore path and see the seals in the fenced-off section, and you can hire bikes from nearby.

We have a variety of one and two bed rooms, many with ocean views. A perfect place for a getaway for the entire family!"}
