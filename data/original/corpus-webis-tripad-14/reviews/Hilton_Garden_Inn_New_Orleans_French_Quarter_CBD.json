The size of our standard king room was exceptionally large by New Orleans standards and comparable to what you find in new construction HGI's around the country. The hotel is a conversion and not very welcoming from the street level entrance which is a parking garage. However, once you reach the lobby via the elevator to the 9th floor, you know you are in an HGI with the exception of a much larger common area than most. I can attest to the earlier reviews that the location is both quiet and convenient. In fact, Harrahs is only four blocks and the French Quarter maybe three. The pool area on the roof provides a nice view of the city and the smallesh fitness center overlooking the terrace is a nice touch. There is very litte wear on this hotel at least on the surface. What a deal for $84 and in New Orleans during peak nights a deal for at least twice that.

Housekeeping was great - you couldn't tell they were on the floor until you saw their cart. We went out on Saturday a.m. and when we returned, in addition to cleaning our room houskeeping had neatly lined our shoes along the wall, placed our toothbrushes in a glass and organized our toiletries on the bathroom counter. We did eat breakfast at the grill there - buffet is $10.95 - and they make omelets, pancakes, french toast, etc. to order. The staff there is very friendly and attentive.
