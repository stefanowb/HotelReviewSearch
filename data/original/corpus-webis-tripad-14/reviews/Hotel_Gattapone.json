The hotel only has 15 rooms and the room was very adequate. The owner was working the desk and you could smell the breakfast being made. I was surprised at how quiet the place was - never even heard another guest, even though it was full. The town itself is a treasure, and we would definately stay here again.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 10, 2004", "id": 2287847}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Umbria", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 10, "very good": 23, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 22}, "aka": "Gattapone Hotel Spoleto", "slim_ranking": 0.46875}
