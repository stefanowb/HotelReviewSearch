Originally I booked 2 rooms then later I cancelled 1 while requesting for an extra bed for the remaining 1 room. Upon arrival they were expecting us to take 2 rooms. Despite me showing them my cancellation letter from Booking.com they still tried to sell us 2 rooms, insisting that the Superior Double Room would be too small to add an extra bed. They also tried selling us the Villa Story (largest 2 storey room sleeping 4). We declined since we were only there for 1 night and it was fine to add the extra bed despite the room being a bit cramp. The Villa Story was more than double our Superior Double Room rate.", "title": "There's no excuse", "user": "Gnatto", "date": "November 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 120642086}], "location": {"country": "Thailand", "continent": "Asia", "city": "Mae Raem"}, "stars": 3.5, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 2, "very good": 3, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 1}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
