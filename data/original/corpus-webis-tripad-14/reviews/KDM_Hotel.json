The rooms were small, a little old but clean. They've hot and cold drinking water in the room but the hot water came out lukewarm. Lots of TV/ cable channels and good bathroom water pressure with very basic toiletries. Reception staff were friendly and breakfast selection was small. Do check with the hotel staff if you are staying in twin-bedded room. We were given a double bed with a sofa bed which was rather slumpy.", "title": "Convenient Location", "user": "WuMinSi", "date": "March 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 27069281}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2009, traveled on business", "text": "I was little sceptical about the place because i asked my friend to book the hotel for my boss and for me.

First room we got smelled a lot like smoke even though its a no smoking hotel, second room we were shown smelled a little less like smoke but we took it anyway just to be done with it. 5am in the morning the crew in the next room gets home from night out and the walls are THIN, which means the 5 am wakeup call we did not want. hotel had no other rooms that night, nor the next night. Nor would they do anything other than let me deal with it or charge a one night penalty for leaving. So we left, and glad we did as we ended up at a WAY better place for not too much more money. AT $75 US KDM is not a deal, might as well spend less to get the same or spend a bit more like the $115 at Hotel Zone 8 which was the best place we stayed in 3 weeks on the road.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "101highwaystar", "date": "June 7, 2009", "id": 31817787}], "location": {"country": "Taiwan", "continent": "Asia"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 9, "average": 31, "very good": 55, "terrible": 1, "excellent": 9}, "aka": "Kdm Hotel Taipei", "slim_ranking": 0.430622009569}
