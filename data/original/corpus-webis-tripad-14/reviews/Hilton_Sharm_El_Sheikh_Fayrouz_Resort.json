You are kidding! Not withstanding this, the room was clean and had all the amenities one might need. In the morning however you can start to appreciate the wonderful location that this hotel affords, we had paid extra for a beachside room and I would recommend this as if you are over the other side the constant beeping of the Egyptians car horns might become annoying.The lush gardens are beutifully tended and the beach is well guarded and immaculate. But what sets this hotel apart is the ever attentive service of the hotel staff, nothing is ever too much trouble and everyone from the manager to the gardener smiles and says hello in perfect English everytime they see you. The food was of exceptional quality every night and they offered a good variety with a different 'theme' every night. Some warned of 'not eating the salad or rice or having ice in your drinks' but I can honestly say this was not an issue in the hotel, the only obvious point is not to drink the tap water. if you do need bottled water however nip round the corner to the little supermarket where it is 25p a bottle rather than the \u00a31.60 the hotle choses to charge!
