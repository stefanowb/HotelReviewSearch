Our original booking was for a base rate of $119.00 and a total of $133.28. Upon check-in at 2 p.m. on the day of our stay, the line for check-in was 40+ minutes long because the hotel was sold out and guests started to arrive. Later we witnessed a check-in line that was an hour+. When we finally reached the desk, they handed us a hotel registration form with a rate of $278.00. We said absolutely not. As it turned out we didn't bring our print-out for the reservation (a big mistake) so they were trying to price gouge us. I indicated that I would drive to Fedex Kinkos to print it out and bring it back but the manager said she would check into it. She went into the back room for a while and came back and apologized and said they had a computer glitch and it was an error. So they ended up giving us the original rate. I also tried to use their business services and swiped my debit card to activate the computer but the mouse didn't work. The machine was charging my card for minutes online but I couldn't even use it. We had to ask the manager to unplug it to stop it from charging me. Before we left the desk, the clerk handed us a piece of paper to sign that indicated that we would not have parties in the room, smoke in the hotel, or have illegal narcotics in our rooms. I've never been more insulted. I'm not even sure if that's legal to do to hotel guests. I never in my life have experienced such treatment. We also booked a room with the capacity for 4 guests as we had another couple staying with us. The hotel informed us that it would be an extra $20 per person to be in the room beyond the first person. I'm wondering how many people book hotel rooms for 1 person? Ridiculous. If the hotel room has the capacity for 4 guests, then why would you have to pay an additional fee per person beyond 1 guest? It doesn't make any sense. Again, more price gouging. I intend to file a complaint with the BBB and Attorney General. My wife and I are in our mid 30s. I'm wondering if the hotel would treat guests in their mid 50s or 60s in the same manner. This is clearly discrimination. The hotel also made all guests wear wristbands and informed us that no unregistered guests of any kind would be allowed to enter the hotel no matter what. All guests had to show a wristband. What???? I've never heard of such a thing in my life and I travel quite a bit. I have a close friend that works in the hotel business doing bookings and she informed me that she has never heard of such practices before and she seems to think that these things are bordering on illegal. Certainly the price gouging is. I heard from several other guests that day that the hotel refused to give them their original reservation rate and rather charged them the $278/night rate which is obscene considering when I booked my room the hotel was charging $119, which then quickly went up to $165 in the weeks following culminating with the $278 rate. It's unbelievable because if that concert had not been going on across the street the Berkeley would have been completely empty. What a way to treat guests. To top it off while we were checking in, the police arrived outside and threatened to tow cars from the entrance way even though guests still needed to unload their belongings. The hotel announced that everyone must park their cars elsewhere. Talk about a complete lack of guest services. I would never stay at this hotel again. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you, this hotel takes the cake for bottom of the barrel service and they excel at mistreating guests.
