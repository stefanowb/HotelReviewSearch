I had a very bad day, cut my knee at the cliffs, almost got hit head on and crashed my car. So I must have been a sight for Finnbarr. He was so kind and reassuring took care of my knee, called a restaurant for me so I could get something to eat, and when I returned from dinner he had put a hot water bottle in my bed to warm it up. The next morning I met Anne his lovely wife, she's a breath of fresh air and a ray of sunshine. Finn and Ann looked after me as if I were there own family. The Coffey house is beautiful overlooks a river and you can see the mountains in the distance. I can only say they are not just proprietors of a business, they treat everyone with such attentive care that you end up feeling like you're part of their family. I fully intend on returning to visit them again.", "title": "Outstanding stay in killorglin", "user": "Stevoshaw", "date": "September 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 178120588}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Just returned home from 4nights in killorglin where we stayed at coffeys rivers , everything was top class ,Anne was a great hostess and made sure we got a great breakfast everyday , Fin was great with his recommendations of where to go each day , we would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a base to tour ring of Kerry and the dingle peninsula", "title": "Warm Hospitality, Great Town", "user": "TravelIRL8", "date": "September 17, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 177568330}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "We recently stayed at Coffey's.
