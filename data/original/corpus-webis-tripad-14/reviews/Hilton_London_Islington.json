We were quickly checked in to room 155, the room was clean and smart, not huge and not having a good view of anything other than a flat roof, but we were only there for one night so we were ok with that. We went out for dinner that evening, there are lots of really nice places to eat in Islington, it makes a nice change from elsewhere in London. There were no noise problems, the temperature of the room was fine, the only issue was that we found the bed to be really hard, but that's personal preference I guess. We booked the breakfast \u00a315 per head, and went down to the busy dining area at about 9.30am. A waitress showed us a table, and rushed through the set up, which is a buffet of cold food, and a buffet of hot food. We went to get some cereal, and returned to the table, hoping to be offered tea/coffee. The waitress passed the table, so we asked for some tea, she replied 'yes', & wandered off, but no tea appeared. So we went up to the hot buffet (on getting up from the table, the same waitress said goodbye as she hurried past - we were just going looking for tea!), and found that all drinks are self service. The hot buffet food is excellent, but there is just one toasting machine, which is just not enough for a queue of hungry people, who are lining up with plates of rapidly chilling food in their hands. Anyway, we got tea, and hot food, and returned to the table, which the waitress had cleared and re-laid! We weren't impressed with their cleaning techniques - flicking the crumbs from the mats on to the floor, all crumbs from the table brushed on to the floor! Nice for the next diner!!", "title": "Not bad, not great", "user": "innerpsystem", "date": "August 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 171940234}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013, traveled with family", "text": "In all, it was an ok stay, not as good as we expected, breakfast food good, the organisation of it could be better, the staff need more training.

The airco in the room worked great though we didn't really need it. Beds are quite comfortable, though we asked to extra duvets to make them more comfy, shame they don't offer toppers for that.
