From the moment I called to make the reservation, I knew we had made the right choice. The representative explained the property, the different room types, assisted in booking a tee time for my husband for the famed south course, and made our dinner reservations at one of the best restaurants I have ever visited. After reading the few negative reviews noting that the lodge is dark, I think the travelers missed the entire point of the property. It is a LODGE designed in CRAFTSMAN architecture - think dark oak mission furniture. The grounds are immaculate. The views are spectacular. The service is excellent without being overbearing. The staff is well-trained. And, our room was huge. I would highly recommend The Lodge to anyone who appreciates attention to detail, beautiful architecture, and the spectacular California coastline.

I have had a chance to stay at 5 and 6 star rated resorts, and have had a chance to travel internationally. Torrey Pines easily meets or exceeds the standards of comfort, service and ambience of these facilities. It falls just a tiny bit short of an Auberge resort at Punta Ballena outside of Cabo, Mexico. As an Architecture nut, the first thing that struck me was how perfectly the designers had managed to make a modern building look and feel like something Greene and Greene or Frank Lloyd Wright had built at the turn of the last century. Perfect down to the last detail -- including the William Morris print wallpaper in the bathrooms. The views and vistas that face out over the golf course are unreal (makes me wish I played the game) I just wish I had more time to spend there, and that I wasn't stuck in a conference room during most of my stay. The service was excellent and the food was perfect. Could not ask for more, especially on a business trip. I have read reviews by one individual that seemed to miss the point of this resort entirely. Described it as old and stale, like a trip to her grandmother's house.
