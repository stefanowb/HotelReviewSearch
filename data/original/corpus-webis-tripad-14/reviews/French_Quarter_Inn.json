Marvin at Reception was there to assist in every way, as were many others. We are a seasoned, retired traveling couple who stay in 3 - 5 star hotels and resorts regularly. Charleston's French Quarter Inn has instantly become one of our favorite destinations. How can you resist being handed a welcome glass of champagne and butterfingers at reception? We were encouraged to sit in front of their working fireplace (a gas charmer, without wood or smoke) on soft, elegant living room chairs and relax while our belongings were being taken up to our room and our car parked. There is a reasonable charge for private parking, but in downtown Charleston this is expected. Coffee and tea are always available in the hotel's delightful lobby where you take in the view of their magnificent spiral staircase, open to a glass ceiling; all very dramatic. Return later for wine, cheese and fruit served daily late afternoons. Cookies in the evening. Mornings begin with a substantial continental breakfast with long hours. And have we mentioned the room? Perfect. Large, immaculate, bright, elegantly comfortable. We enjoyed talking to the staff in general and especially to the General Manager, Bernard Visscher, who is most welcoming and entertaining as he told us of his early days growing up in The Netherlands and traveling to many countries as he worked his way up the corporate hotel ladder. He speaks five languages and can regale you with many international tales.
