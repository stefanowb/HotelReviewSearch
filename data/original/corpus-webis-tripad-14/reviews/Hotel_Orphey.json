Staff speak reasonable english and are very helpful. Our room was spacious and very comfortable, with a balcony and lovely views over the hills. A little tired and in need of refurbishment, but well looked after and very clean. At the time of our stay there were no other guests in the hotel, and it must have 60 rooms. This was not a problem except that it was eerilie quiet and they didn't bother putting out a breakfast buffet but just asked us what we wanted (which led to some strange breakfasts as a result of linguistic or cultural misunderstandings). We were told during our stay that they had problems with their credit card systems and we would have to pay by cash, suggesting they might be in financial difficulty - which wouldn't be surprising with all the new hotel and appartment developments on the other side of town. But while it is still there I would recommend Hotel Orphey as a very good place to stay and excellent value.", "title": "Very good hotel but strangely quiet", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Steve-G23", "date": "August 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 37720544}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2009, traveled solo", "text": "Situated in quiet part of old-town Bansko..
