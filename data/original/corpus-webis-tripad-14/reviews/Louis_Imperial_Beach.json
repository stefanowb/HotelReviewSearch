Was a little wary after reading some the other reviews but I can honestly say they must have been very picky. We found the staff were more than helpful, food was excellent, entertainment team very enthusiastic (didn't push if you didn't want to take part), standard of cleanliness was excellent both inside and out. Yes the bedrooms are a little tired (our's was a double family room 367, with lovely view over pool and sea) but everything you needed was there and when the weather is fantastic outside we didn't want to be inside any more than necessary! We were all inclusive and my opinion is that's the best deal, includes breakfast, lunch and dinner along with late morning and midnight snacks though we never needed any snacks. Evening meals had theme nights, greek, chinese, indian to name few and were really good but there was always the carvery if you didnt want to try different food. Kids could go up to the pool bar and get their drinks as when needed with our A.I card but soon the bar staff got to recognise us and we didnt need to show it. Bar staff were all nice had some great laughs with Tanju and Emil, and we have never seen so many pretty, hardworking waitresses all in the one hotel! The evening restaurant has a strict dress code for men, long trousers and no sleeveless T-shirts and one guest was indeed refused entry on one occassion during our stay. Have read in other reviews that men complained it was too hot to wear long trousers but the air conditioning was on in the evenings. If I had one fault to mention it would be meal times - as meals are buffet style I was a bit shocked at some parents who were quite happy to let small children go up and help themselves then they would rush back to their tables, their plates held at all sorts of angles. Once my son had a plate of watermelon land at his feet from another child's plate and one morning at breakfast I had to help a little boy deal with a plate of pancakes he had dropped, crying his eyes out, parent no-where to be seen! Can't really blame the hotel for this but did mention on the hotel comment's form that perhap's they need to address situation? But don't let this put you off as food quality more than made up for a few thoughtless parent's. Can't give you any info on trips etc as we wanted a relaxing holiday by the pool and sea and that's exactly what we got. Beach a little rocky but water very clear and refreshing. If you want more peace and quiet then the garden loungers next to the beach provided this. There's a new footpath into Paphos Harbour area and takes about 25mins. We only went for a look but if you wanted anything to eat or drink there were lots of pavement restaurant's that looked nice. We did order a taxi from reception one day (10 euros each way) and an E- class mercedes took us into the older part of Paphos where we went to the local markets to buy some souvenirs. Got speaking to other guests around the pool and for many of them this was return visits to the hotel, and I would certainly go back there with my family.", "title": "Fab Holiday", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "LRW64", "date": "August 10, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 74579556}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010", "text": "I have to be honest, we would not ordinarily have chosen this hotel (our perference is boutique/5 star) but it had been picked for a family wedding.
