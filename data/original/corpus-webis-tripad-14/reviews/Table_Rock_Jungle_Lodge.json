After an hour and a half drive to San Ignacio we arrived at Table Rock and were met by the friendly Jose who showed us to our cabana, the Aracari, and oriented us with the property. The property is expansive, lush, and well maintained and we enjoyed walking through the orchards, picking fruit and either munching on it or feeding it to the resident donkeys. We ordered the meal plan and were very pleased with the decision. The alternative for food is an expensive (USD20-30) and bumpy cab ride into town if you don\u2019t have a rental car, and we quite liked having gourmet food while in the middle of the jungle. The food was fabulous and so filling! The chef is extremely talented and makes delectable food. Yes, the meal plan is a bit pricey but you are truly getting what you pay for. My only critique is that the food is very Americanized, i.e. steaks, pork chops, chicken breast, so if you are looking for authentic Belizean food you\u2019re better off going into town occasionally. Since we were heading to San Pedro after Table Rock we figured we\u2019d get enough Belizean cuisine there.", "title": "Perfect Honeymoon Spot", "user": "Lisa M", "date": "November 15, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 145477137}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our room was perfect and we found the bed to be quite comfortable. The bedding was soft, and in fact, most of the linens and towels are imported from the States since the quality of these products aren\u2019t as nice in Belize. The ceiling fan kept us very comfortable while we slept at night and I would not be concerned at all that there is no A/C here. The bathroom is large and the shower even larger. My one critique here is that the lighting is very dim in the shower area so it\u2019s difficult to see. The water also cycles between very hot and cold while you\u2019re in there which was a bit of a nuisance but you have to remember that you\u2019re in the jungle at a lodge that is 100% off the grid. They generate their own power and capture rain water for the showers, so while I realize that I\u2019m being picky, I also realize that the amenities are fabulous considering where you\u2019re staying. Because this is the jungle, also be aware that you might find some critters in your room. We had a cockroach in the bathroom that we weren\u2019t able to kill ourselves but when we told the staff they immediately tried to get rid of it. Again, it comes with the territory and is something to be aware of and this may happen at any lodge in the jungle, not just at Table Rock.", "title": "Love, Love, Love Table Rock!", "user": "AdrienneCowie", "date": "November 10, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 145107265}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Finally, we enjoyed the amenities around the property. There were canoes and inner tubes provided that were essentials for spending a day on the Macal River, which I highly recommend. You can easily burn an entire day at the property, either swinging in a hammock, navigating the river, or exploring the property in general. For us, four days was a perfect length to spend in the jungle. We got to go on two tours, spend an entire day at Table Rock, and enjoy an afternoon in San Ignacio and didn\u2019t feel like we missed out on anything. It's also worth noting that the staff is spectacular at Table Rock. The owners and staff make it a point to get to know their patrons without being intrusive and it creates a relaxing, inviting atmosphere.

It is a small, intimate lodge that, as another reviewer stated, really does feel like a bed and breakfast. The pros: Clean, comfortable rooms in small, thatched roof buildings. They provide canoes for exploring the river, and walking/exploring the grounds is very nice. The best part of the lodge is definitely the food. Every night our meals were excellent, and breakfast was also delicious. They were also very accomodating to our kids. The cons (which really are nit-picky): The rooms are not all very private - it would be nice to have a more secluded porch area to sit at. A couple of the staff were a bit surly, definitely not as warm and welcoming as other places we have been in Belize. The tours booked through the hotel are very expensive (but I think tours booked through any hotel are pricey -- it may be better to book directly through an agency).
