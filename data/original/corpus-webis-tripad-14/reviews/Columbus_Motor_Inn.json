We found the Columbus Motor Inn on tripadvisor and followed the recommendations here. We are very glad we did! The main thing Columbus Motor Inn has going for it is LOCATION! It is absolutely perfectly centered for everything we wanted to do as a family. It is 1 1/2 blocks from the Powell-Mason St. cable car terminus, making grabbing a cable car uptown to Union Square or Chinatown a breeze. Bus #30 stops right in front of the hotel and it takes you from the Palace of Fine Arts one one end to SBC Park on the other. We were within easy walking distance of Fisherman'w Wharf, Pier 39, Alcatraz and the tourist shops. Within a few blocks are great Italian restaurants and Pat's Cafe around the corner makes a great omellette. We parked the car in the FREE parking garage attached to the hotel. We bought a 3 day MUNI pass and used public transportation to go where ever we wanted. We had a standard 2 double bed room on the third floor that was quite spacious. It was clean, well maintained and there were fresh fluffy towels each day. From the bay window we could see Alcatraz, Coit Tower, and the TransAmerica building. Wow! The room didn't have any \"extra\" perks- refrigerator, microwave, guest laundry or continental breakfast, but the location made up for it. The staff was very helpful setting up city tours, recommending eating places, and giving travel directions. This is a great economical hotel at the heart of where we wanted to be in San Francisco.
