We choose the Moorings Hotel as it was near the Strathclyde Park. Three other families stayed as well and were all delighted with the good value of the family rooms. The food was excellent. The dinner menu suited all palates and the children were delighted. The Hotel is like a large Guest House with a very good restaurant. There are no other facilities in it but that suited us as we were out and about all three days. The M&D Theme Park is also in Strathclyde Park. We all went there. Small but still fun for the children. Overall the Moorings was a very good choice, simple clean and friendly. It is located very near the town of Motherwell and about 10 minute walk to Strathclyde Park.

The room although in the basement was well decorated and had tea and coffee making facilities. Also satellite television. The bathroom was small but adequate and had a shower over a bath. Not my favourite as I prefer a shower room but the power shower was fine. We booked bed and breakfast and the breakfast on the Sunday was very good, cereals and fruit juice as well as fresh fruit followed by a cooked breakfast which offered a choice of porridge, smoked fish, full scottish breakfast with a choice of cooked eggs. Service was first class and every request was met with a smile and nothing seemed to be a problem. Could we please take this hotel round Europe with us.

A work colleague always stays there and I checked out this website which spoke volumes. Even before arriving, the hotel got my seal of approval. I was due to arrrive late - about 10:30 pm and asked if it would be possible to order a late snack for myself and my colleague. One or two e-mails later I was assured that the chef would prepare something for us. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff, check in was very efficient and we were told without asking that our food was ready and a table set aside. Within minutes we had drinks and food. Our 'snack' was a plate of 16 sandwiches, a bowl of salad, some potato crisps and two generous bowls of fries, again all was served with great courtesy. The rooms were excellent, very clean, modern and with all the usual refinements. A good night's sleep was followed by a great breakfast, a wide choice and again the staff were very attentive. I will be returning to Motherwell soon and know exactly where I will be staying. I thoroughly recommend this hotel.
