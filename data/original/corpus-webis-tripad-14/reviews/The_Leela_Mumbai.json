We had specifically requested an extra bed since there were four of us, 2 adults and 2 children. This was confirmed by The Leela. On arrival we found out that there were no such arrangements available by them and furthermore the staff did little or nothing to assist. Despite several requests nothing was sorted. My wife and I took in turns to sleep on the couch for the 2 nights we were there. We were absolutely appalled by this treatment. Our misery did not end there. We decided to have our evening meals in the hotel and on both occassions our food was brought out wrong, not what we had ordered! we then had to wait a further 45 minutes before our correct food actually arrived! On our final morning of departure we sat for brekfast oredered our requirements and 40 minutes later nothing had arrived. In the meantime two other tables which had arrived after us had already been served. When I finally complained the staff did not even know what my order was and were playing guessing games as to what they thought my order was, which was simply 2 fried eggs! How difficult is that to accomplish? As a matter of fact we were not the only ones in the hotel who had complaints. Over our two day stay there we experienced 3 other seperate unrelated incidents where the guests of the hotel were completely appalled by the servoce and staff had got things wrong.
