We were given a tour of the premises, including the pool, patio and the dining room (with snacks!). Sam was always ready with recommendations including restaurants, wineries and where to pick up odds and ends. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable - before we checked out I had to find out what kind of mattress we had because it had been soooo long since I slept that well!! (After Napa we stayed at a hotel in Sonoma and did not sleep nearly as good), Breakfast was delicious everyday (loved the croissant french toast) and enjoyed a cheese plate while soaking in the jacuzzi tub.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jlwoj", "date": "October 22, 2008", "id": 21108825}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We are already planning a return trip to Napa and cannot imagine staying anywhere else!", "title": "Most Romantic Getaway", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "DramaQueen77", "date": "October 14, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 20887958, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 How can I choose only one thing?!", "disliked": "\u2014 Leaving!"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "When we decided to spend our first wedding anniversary in Napa, my husband and I searched long and hard for a place to stay.

Our room was spacious, well appointed with jacuzzi, fireplace, four poster bed, nightstand with fresh flowers, lovely linens, and plush towels and robes. It was truly home away from home. The bath was spacious, and CLEAN. I mean CLEAN. I can not overstate HOW AMAZING BREAKFAST WAS each morning. Three courses, expertly prepared and presented. I can still taste the most delicious raisin bread french toast with vanilla cream sauce...oh my! We were taken very well care of by our Host - Sam and staff. He was very knowledgable and a pleasure to see every morning. He respected our privacy, but was there in a snap if we needed. He runs a wonderful gem of a B&B. I highly recommend this Inn as a lovely place to stay when visiting the Napa Valley. It is centrally located right off Rt 29 and the Silverado Trail. Easy access to all in the area.

As our home away from home we look to them for nurturing. As our base for new adventures we look within their walls for inspiration. Ideally situated on the border of Sonoma and Napa at the gateway between the Bay Area and Wine Country, the Candlelight Inn\u2019s bucolic surroundings have been providing a charming and romantic backdrop since 1929.It\u2019s rustic and secluded charm boasts an historic Tudor building of whitewashed plaster set between blackened oak timbers cozily situated under the shade of its own Redwood grove on a tributary of the Napa River. The Candlelight Inn can be as public or private as you\u2019d like. As a romantic getaway you\u2019ll find its quiet seclusion an inspiration for opening yourself to intimate moments. As a collaborator in providing world-class dining and touring experiences, Candlelight Inn proves the perfect ally.Whether soaking up sunshine by the pool or hiking the nearby hills, you\u2019ll know that you are in one of California\u2019s most prized destinations.Aware of its history, but not enraptured by it, the Candlelight Inn Napa Valley is a reflection of the rich cultural history of Wine Country and a hub of all the diverse and evolving landscapes around it. After a day enjoying the bounty of the surrounding environs, or at the end of a long evening spent ruminating around the dinner table, Candlelight Inn serves as the ideal space to transition or expand your mood.
