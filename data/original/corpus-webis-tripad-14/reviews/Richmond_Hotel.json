I have stayed at probably 50 hotels in the last year and I would place this one right in the middle. I paid only $87/night through Hotwire so that makes my expectations a little less than if i stayed at the Ritz Carlton or Loews. The room had no drawer space but was furnished just like any other hotel. Anyone who complains about small stains on the carpet and chair has to realize that it is a beach hotel so people are probably putting their sandy towels and bathing suits on the floor or chairs...which explains the stains. I found the staff to be courteous and prompt. The grounds were in good shape and the location was perfect as it was not as loud as many complain about. I did hear a couple having sex through the wall but they probably heard us too and aren't we adults afterall? I would highly recommend the hotel for under $100 a night...but remember you get what you pay for and dont expect Ritz Carlton quality when paying Super 8 prices people.", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 9, 2005", "id": 3651612}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "loved it", "text": "Stayed at the richmond, on south beach we loved it, one of the best hotels iv stayed in and i have traveled all around the world. the beach backs on to the bottom of the hotel, lovely looking grounds, pool really nice.

(This is not our first trip to South Beach, I have worked in Miami on several occassins and we vacationed there several years ago.) Nevertheless we ventured off to South Beach. We utilized an internet travel agency and came up with the Richmond nicely located on Collins Avenue right in the heart of the large hotels. After being greated by a very professional front desk clerk, the highlight of the stay, we quickly learned that the Richmond only had location going its way. We were greeted by workman immediately outside our window making some type of repair and speaking very loudly. Towels were unavailable at the pool due to the fact that the poolside bar/restaurant had closed for the day (3:00 pm) and the cook gives out the towels or housekeepping forgot to bring the supply to the cook. (It is always nice to come in from the beach around 3:00 pm from a long day on the beach for a nice drink, unfortunately that is the time it closes.) Our first night we realized the meanning of paper thin walls. Our neighbor was having some type of personal problem, which I could tell you word-for-word but then this would not be published, with someone he apparently cared for, this went on for two nights. Oh yeah, he was talking with them over a cell phone with radio capabilities so we could hear both sides of the conversation. There were no amenties, other than an overpriced breakfast bar (even of South Beach), a spa that was broken unless you wished to blow in the activation tube where a button at one time worked in the place of your breath. At night, if you wanted a drink from the front porch bar you had to tear the bartender away from his buddies sitting at a nearby table, this was a terrible inconvenience for him. Finally, the straw that broke the camel's back was our third night there. The neighbor either resolved his problenm or checked out, however, at a little before 8:00 am the workmen who greated us on Friday when we arrived were back at their repair outside our window on Monday. We were gone before 10:00am.
