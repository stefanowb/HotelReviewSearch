We stayed in a deluxe room but were disappointed that the bed was two singles put together. Although good quality and comfy beds, not very romantic! Beautiful countryside location, yet so close to meadow hall if you like shopping as well as a country walk. Dinner and breakfast very nice although wine stocks were low as the first 4 wines we chose they didn't have! I was also charged for a bottle of water I didn't get and the bill was \u00a310 more than the price advertised at the time of booking earlier this year. Luckily both issues were sorted and refunded without a problem.

There is a cosy bar area downstairs and had the weather been better we may have braved the garden for after dinner drinks, although as has been commented on by other reviewers, the prices are standard hotel ones so a bit on the pricey side.
