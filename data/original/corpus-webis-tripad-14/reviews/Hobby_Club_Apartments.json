At around 1:30 the apartment was ready. Clean, roomy with a huge adequate bathroom. The only concern that we had was our 14 year old son had to sleep on the bed settee (more like a drawer from under the sette. He lasted one night then decided to sleep on the settee (more comfortable). Overall a clean and roomy apartment, pool clean, beach close by (we used after 5:00 as it was empty but still warm enough to go swimming.) As for eating out we spent several night at the Sinbad restaurant that is just down the road, good value for money and my fussy son ate everything they gave him!
