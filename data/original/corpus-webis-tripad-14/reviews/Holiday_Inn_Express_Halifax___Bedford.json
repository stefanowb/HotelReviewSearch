The hotel meet my expectations. It is the standard hotel quality type found throughout Atlantic Canada. Though a few updates have been made to the hotel since it first opened, don't expect trendy or industry leading decor/design. With expectations set, the hotel does offer a clean room and comfortable stay at an affordable rate for any family looking for value with a stress-free hotel. The beds were clean and provide a good sleep. The changeable duvet cover (now becoming standard in most North American hotels) is certainly a positive. One issue with the rooms: the thermostat controls are digital and can be confusing. It appeared there was little beyond the \"auto\" setting and for those of us wishing to sleep with the fan on, have to put up with the fan coming on and off throughout the night. The hotel does provide a great breakfast. There are hot food items available in the breakfast (ie. eggs, sausage, waffles) along with the standard continental items (ie. toast, cereal, yogurt). Located next to the hotel is a Tim Hortons, for those needing your familiar cup of coffee. The hotel does offer coin-operated laundry facilities and a small fitness room. All in all, our stay was enjoyable and we would return. I must make one point however. The pool area was a bit of disappointment.
