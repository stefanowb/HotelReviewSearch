It's possible that I got one of the older rooms, although I paid slightly more for a \"deluxe\" room since the standard rooms were sold out. Bathroom could have been cleaned better, pillows were over-stuffed and uncomfortable, but I do like the way the beds are made so that the duvet is covered by laundered sheets.

He then tells me he doesnt have a king size room available (even though thats what I reserved). I then get a key to my new room (it has two queens) and I head up... as I get off the elevator (right by my new room) I see a man walking into my room! Serioulsy he has given me another occupied room! By this point I am totally freaked out and unwilling to stay at this hotel. I have to go deal with Bryan at the front desk again and cancel my room. Now I am stuck in a city with no hotel and I have to take more time to try to locate one with availability in the area. Not cool!

I must say that the front desk was excellent and gave us some extra help. We had two rooms and my mother needed to check in early because she wasn't going with us for the day. They were very accommodating. My mother's room seemed pretty clean and she didn't have any complaints, which was good. If just rating on her experience, I would give the hotel a rating of 5. However, our room had a dirty sheer drape that had something spilled on it, a large area, you couldn't miss it. Also, one of our bed sheets looked like it had blood on it and we needed to do a flush of the toilet when we came in. Other than that things looked fairly clean, but possibly could use a little sprucing up. I was surprised that the room didn't have any granite counters, which is more updated. However, their all white cultured marble look in the bathrooms did have a nice, clean look to it. We had problems getting ice around Midnight and after checking all the ice machines, some weren't working, I went to the front desk person, and he went into the breakfast kitchen and got some for us. Their breakfast was the best of our trip, after staying at 3 other hotels. The variety and taste of the breakfast items was good and there were several hot choices.
