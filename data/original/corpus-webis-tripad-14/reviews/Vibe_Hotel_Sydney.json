We arrived at 11am and were given our room straight away and it was a very spacious room (their standard) and contained a sofa, dressing room area in addition to the usual bed, bathroom, dressing table and mini bar. The windows werent the best and let in a slight bit of the road noise but after a day around Sydney that was no issue. We did not have breakfast at the hotel but did partake of the lunch menu at AUD12.50 including a drink and utilised a voucher you can find near reception at the back of a leaflet book for a buy one get one free main meal for dinner one night which was very nice. Location is great and just a two minute walk to the Museum train stop which is 15 mins from the airport at AUD15. The whole city is within walking distance of the hotel - circa 20 mins to the Harbour, you can purchase for a ound AUD30 a bus pass from central station (10 min walk away) for the tourist bus that takes you to all the sights and the beach and is well worth it. There is a pool and although small is great to sit besides and relax after a day of sightseeing. Would definately stay again.", "title": "Great Rooms", "user": "katie23Wakefield", "date": "October 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 85346760}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2009", "text": "I stayed at the vibe with my daughter for a couple of nights last year.
