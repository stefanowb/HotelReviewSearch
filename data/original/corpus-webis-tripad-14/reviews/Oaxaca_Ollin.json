TravelAdvisor listed this bed and breakfast with lots of glowing reviews and the right price. They confirmed immediately that rooms were available and asked for a credit card, we expressed our concern in doing this on the net and they took us at our word and kept the rooms for us. Just give the cab driver the address, as the name is not known and he tried to take us to the nearby Holiday Inn. We asked him to call the dispatcher that got us there after just a few turns. We were greeted with the local Jamaica Tea in the spacious entry with fountain, dining room and living room looking onto the swimming pool. Local art crafts are placed throughout, sun hats and books on loan and someone always in attendance. We needed beds for 3 adults and were provided with this wonderful major room with queen size bed, balcony overlooking the pool and the inner courtyard. Another room with single bed, sink and beautiful Mexican tile counter. Bathroom with stall shower, sink and more of the lovely tile. All the beds, tables and chairs were deeply carved with the Diego Rivera lily pattern. The breakfast with coffee or hot chocolate was very gourmet and different each day. This is located within walking distance of the famous church, museum zocola and enormous markets. We had a slow flow in the shower one afternoon but that was attended to immediately. Taxi service arranged for you on demand. Wonderful beds. A few critters making night noises but the human activity very quiet. The air conditioned airport was only a 15 minute ride on Saturday morning. Small, efficient, on time with a nice deli and pitchers of orange juice and local coffee, and a few lovely museum pieces. Smaller planes you are led to on the tarmac.
