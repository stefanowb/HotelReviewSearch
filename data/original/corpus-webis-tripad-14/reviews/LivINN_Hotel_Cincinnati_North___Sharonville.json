There was a small fridge and microwave in the room along with a safe that was very convenient. The pool was nice with covered tent areas.

The staff was not very helpful, could not even give us directions from Kings Island, or even tell us if the hotel was north or south of K.I. The room was fairly clean, no major complaints (and I am very picky), the complementary breakfast was the worst I've ever seen- waffles, cereal, bread and apples were it.
