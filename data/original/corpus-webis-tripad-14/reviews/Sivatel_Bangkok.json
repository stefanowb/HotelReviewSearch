Infinity pool was also great-looks right down on the British Embassy! Not a huge area around the pool so I wonder if it might be too crowded if hotel very busy?

Staff were extremely friendly and professional and treated us like VIP guests even though we were dressed in shorts and t-shirts after getting off the plane from Phuket. The 2 bedroom suite was huge. The bed was the most comfortable I had ever slept in. The buffet breakfast had great quality and variety. Excellent service and coffee. Had a few meals in the Cafe on the ground floor and found the quality of the food and the cocktails to be of a high standard. There is an ATM on site which I found very convenient. The Sivatel is a short walk to the Ploen Chit sky train and close to Siam Paragon and MBK shopping centres. The kids loved the infinity pool (great photo opportunities) and myself and my husband enjoyed a few margaritas on the sun loungers. A welcome oasis from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. The Sivatel is well presented and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Have booked in for a week in July this year.
