It is surrounded by an incredible verdant garden, guarded by a majestic centenary cedar.Here, you will find an ancient house with its own soul. All the windows, doors and staircases are living details of the 19th century.After a full restoration, Villa Branca Jacinta exudes comfort and simplicity. It appeals to a romantic and mystic imagination, recalling the works of Lord Byron or E\u00e7a de Queiros.You will find a beautiful place to rest after long walking days through Serra de Sintra, ancient castles and palaces or discovering the magical Quinta da Regaleira."}
