Other than that, the room pretty much provided everything we were looking for...a place to crash, watch cable, keep a few drinks in the mini fridge, a microwave, and a nice, little view outside the bathroom window which faced the beach.

It was. It was by far the worst place I've ever stayed in. We first walked into the lobby to check in and the lobby had a funky smell and looked like the carpet hadn't been cleaned in years. Well our room wasn't any better, first we couldn't open the door all the way cause it hit the bed cause the room was so small. My bedroom at home is bigger then the entire room with the bathroom. The smell was horrible and you can't even open a window to even try and air it out. The carpet hadn't been vacuumed in years and it looked like the bathroom hadn't bee touched in that long either. I had to wear my flip flops in the shower cause I was afraid to touch the floor. They gave us 2 towels and when I asked for more they told me that I would need to bring him all the dirty stuff before he could give me more, and I said I thought that is what the maid was for and he looked at me like I was crazy.
