The lady then reluctantly said it was actually only for the people working there, and for the guests there was bottled water to be paid, but for this time it was ok, as the water bottles had finished.

We turned up with no booking and got a dorm room. Lockers provided for security, relatively clean for a hostel, but then again, you're staying in a hostel. The social area was great, pool, cooking facilities, hammocks and generally quite spacious. Dorms are (as the lonely planet guide suggests) very stuffy in the evenings, only to be semi-cooled by a noisy fan. After a day of walking Iguazu falls, you pretty much sleep through it, though. Aimed at slightly younger crowd, but good location, decent price.
