There is a resident cat that everyone falls in love with, named Cowabunga, and she had 4 kittens she was tending to while we were there.

There is lots of room to visit with others in your party while you enjoy spectacular views! The steps up and down to the apartments were a challenge with luggage, but the end result of being perched on the edge of the island overlooking views that have to be experienced to understand are well worth it. We communicated directly with Andreas on the internet, and he is right on top of things, and very easy to deal with, and knows English very well. His recomendations for places to see, and eat were right on, but I would definately suggest the Caldera walk from Fiera, and also the walk down the steps to the port town for an evening dinner.
