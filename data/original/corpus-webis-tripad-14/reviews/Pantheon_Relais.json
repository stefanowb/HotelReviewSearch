Our bedroom was fantastic (we stayed in the bedroom next to the reception desk) - the bed was really comfortable, the room was decorated beautifully and the shower was out of this world!! The location of this quirky B&B couldn't be much better - literally a 2 minute walk to both The Pantheon and Trevi Fountain. The street that the B&B is on is beautiful and very traditional - which a selection of restaurants to choose from. Staff were excellent and I really hope I get to come back!!", "title": "A little bit different but worth the price, will come back!", "user": "MartinTAmsterdam", "date": "December 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188483818}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Very nice and good located Hotel. Don't expect a regular hotel, because there are only a few rooms, but very well equiped, free internet and every important spot in Rome on walking distance. We had a wunderfull time. Breakfast is room service, and you can order anything you like. It will be brought in your room. Own coffemachine, as well for tea and a minibar. Very friendly staff, we feel like staying in someone's expensive apartment. Bathrobes, hairdryer, very new bathroom, large TV set, clean, cosy and a perfect bed.", "title": "Quirky bed & breakfast in historic centre of Rome", "user": "FormerNewYorker11223", "date": "December 13, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187515335}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "This is a small (only 4 rooms) bed and breakfast accommodation right beside the Pantheon in the centre of Rome. Note that despite what the website might say it is not a hotel, so don't expect 24-hr room service, concierge, fitness suite, etc. Breakfast is served in your room but is best skipped if you want a really early start as it tended to be served slightly later than we wanted in our experience. On the plus side the location is fantastic; you are right in the heart of Rome within walking distance of all the major sights. The room we stayed in (Hermes room) was clean and comfortable although the clear glass door on the bathroom took some getting used to, along with the Chromotherapy lights everywhere. If you don't know your travelling companion well at the start of your trip, you certainly will by the end! Free WiFi worked quite well for us although seemed slow - too slow for Skype etc but good enough for email and messaging. This is a great place to stay if you want to be right in the city centre and close to the sights. Staff are friendly and make you feel welcome, but this is not a hotel, so set your expectations accordingly.", "title": "Lots to say", "user": "Andr\u00e9s A", "date": "November 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 183435668}], "location": {"country": "Italy", "region": "Lazio", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Rome"}, "variance": {"poor": 2, "average": 1, "very good": 20, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 47}, "slim_ranking": 0.0978689818469}
