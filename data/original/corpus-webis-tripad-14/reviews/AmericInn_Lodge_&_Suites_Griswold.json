Location is ideal \u2013 right off the highway. Staff was very friendly at check in and check out. The room and halls were very quiet even with being full - just as the hotel advertises. We had a room with 2 queen beds with a mini/fridge/microwave. Decent space for a budget motel with an extra separate sink outside bathroom. The mattresses were very firm and linens a little rough but not a big deal to us for one night. I give the room cleanliness huge pluses and minuses. The room and bathroom were extremely clean. The newer AC unit was great\u2026.wasn\u2019t dusty or smelly. Minuses: The room was non smoking but the hallway reeked of smoke and our room had a light scent of smoke. (Gross) The remote corners of the room were very dusty and cobwebby. The carpet could use a good general vacuum. (I never understand why these hotels can\u2019t vacuum room in-between guests.) Note: this hotel charges an optional but automatic fee for the in room safe. (?) You\u2019ll need to request they don\u2019t charge you at check in or a refund when checking out. The breakfast was your basic cereal, bread/donuts etc...all we need is coffee anyway. We did not use the shuttle to Foxwoods but it was about a 20 minute drive through cornfields. A little better quality then some of the other local budget motels.

I think it's probably so expensive because of the location. It was hard to sleep because the mattresses are very hard, and there was A LOT of light coming in from around the curtains (they were too short and not high up enough to block the light). There was a VERY bright light in the parking lot outside my room, so this really disrupted my sleep. This was a non-smoking room but had a musty smell, like smoke, in the bathroom. Also, this hotels touts extra-quiet walls, but I could hear the tv next door like it was in my room.

When we started the jacuzzi in our room, we noticed that it was a little dirty, we asked if someone was there to clean the tub for us and there was no one else except the front desk attendant. Instead of her coming to clean it for us and leave the desk with no one to attend it, we decided to clean it ourselves. The next day we just wanted to inform the general manager of our concern and she was not around, so we left our number and asked for her to call us. Almost four hours went by without a response. We called her and she was very rude and unprofessional over the phone. She would not compensate us at all and accused us of not having the attendant clean it for us.
