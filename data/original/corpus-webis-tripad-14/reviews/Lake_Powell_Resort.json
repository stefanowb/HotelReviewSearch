I feel that the resort could have e-mailed a complimentary pass when the reservation is confirmed. The rooms run about $140/night. The rooms are clean, for the most part, but hair was found on the bathtub and there was grime on the floor in back of the toilet. No microwave in the room. The restaurant was poor. Food choices were very limited and no healthy food choices. The cafe had really poor quality sandwiches that we bought the next day for a light lunch. They were a day old and soggy. We went to Dennys just outside the marina for two meals and once we went into Page for breakfast. No elevators in the resort, so pick a first floor room if you have any problems climbing stairs with luggage. The landscape looks fine from a distance, but a closer look shows the lack of upkeep (weeds, weeds, weeds) bushes and shrubs have lots of dead growth that needs to be cut back.

I don't recommend staying in Page ( which is 8 miles away from the Lake Powell) becuase the village itself is unattractive. Besides 15 churches, few motels, a school, a Marriott on its offset, and a huge Wal-Mart accross the road there is nothing. I recommend staying at Lake Powell resort, at least you have excellent views of the lake, boat tours are arrange daily, restaurants are on site, 2 pools. The rooms are well maintained but small. I feel that a room with 2 queen beds that is designed for at least 4 people is suitable only for 3 ( 2 adults and one child). There is very limited walking space. I guess the assumption is that you are always outside. The other minus is a noisy AC/Heat unit in the room. Otherwise, the hotel met our needs to accomodate us for 2 nights to explore the area: the lake Powell, Canon Glen Dam, Anthelope Canyons, and Colorado River. A tip for the Anthelope canyons: we visited during a srping break ( april 2012) and instead of booking with the private companies in Page, we asked for the directions at the hotel desk, drove directly to the canyons and took a guided trip directly from there. It is cheapper that way and no commitments. The tours are going often as soon as a group of about 12 people fills in.
