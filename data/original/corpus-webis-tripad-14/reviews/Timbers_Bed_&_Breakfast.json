Breakfast was wonderful and the veg option was great. The room treats of homemade food made the experience feel very family friendly. We will definately go there again when we are back in the area.

At first, i thought I'd taken a wrong turn as I had ended up in a beautiful housing estate. To my delight, I realised this was not a mistake but a superb detached house, transformed into a B&B. Angela met me at the door and following a brief chat, showed me to my room. Unbeliveable attention to detail!!! The Bay room, which I chose to stay in is immaculately decorated, with high end fixtures and fittings, which include a huge LCD TV and a fantastic en-suite bathroom. Angela makes home made cookies and shortbread along with a decanter of sherry and hand made truffles. Right up my street! I fancied a curry that night so Angela recommended a place in town, which turned out to be pretty good. (I'm spoilt with regards to curry, as I'm from Yorkshire!) Upon my return, I met Alan. We had plenty to chat about, as we are both sports fans. I headed up to my room to finish some work id started. The king size bed was amazing and I had the best nights sleep. It was home from home in many ways. It is evident that a lot of time and thought has gone in to the detail of everything required. The morning came and my breakfast was ready right on cue. Full english,perfectly cooked with top quality ingredients. Can't beat it! People usually feel like a review as positive as this, with no negatives, isn't realistic; something I agree with. I feel it is a guests responsibilty to highlight anything such as because it helps the owners improve their business. However, I can honestly say....there is NOTHING they could've done better. As I stay away on a regular basis and have a healthy hotel budget through my company, I stay 4*-5* on most occasions. This outshines nearly every hotel I have stayed in. Seriously people, if Colchester is your destination, please stay at Timbers. You will not find anywhere better.", "title": "Couldn't believe my luck!!!!", "user": "Stefan D", "date": "October 5, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 118966592}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled solo", "text": "An emergency trip to Colchester due to a family crisis was made significantly less stressful thanks to Angela and Alan at Timbers! Following a cancelled operation at Colchester hospital during which time I stayed at a well known chain of Inns directly off the A12 (which proved to be more than a little disappointing throughout), I trawled the internet extensively to find alternative accommodation...not an easy task due to the Bank Holiday weekend. Having previously paid for two nights at the aforementioned \"Inn\" and losing one due to the cancelled op and the need to return to work, I booked just one night at the Timbers not wanting to tempt fate (or lose more money). On arrival, Angela welcomed me by enquiring about my Mum and whether I had eaten following my long journey. I was escorted to the Oak Room which was delightfully spacious, spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated with a fabulously comfortable bed, opulent fabrics and furnishings, a lovely ensuite with luxurious toiletries, wide screen TV, scrummy biscuits, decanter of sherry, cafetiere with ground coffee (as well as the usual tea bags, sachets etc), fresh milk not to mention the most delicious homemade chocolates. Following an early morning start, I was set up for the long day ahead with the most delicious breakfast of cereal, fresh orange, lovely coffee, toast and the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had (thank you Alan), I advised Angela that if Mum's op took place that day I would need to stay in Colchester again that night. She promptly advised me that they would keep the room for me and to just give her a call when I knew what was happening which meant I could concentrate on Mum's needs without worrying... a huge relief! Thankfully the op went ahead and I did stay a second night and after a good night's sleep, enjoyed a full English breakfast the following morning - delicious! Wished I could have stayed under less stressful circumstances but wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else during a difficult time! So thankful I found the Timbers and definitely hope to go again although I suspect given the excellent reviews it might be fully booked! Exceptional!
