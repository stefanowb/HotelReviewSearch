The toiletries were very nice (Crabtree and Evelyn), the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious (with a very large tub!). The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only problem I had with the hotel was the internet prices. 10\u20ac/hour, or 22\u20ac/day!!! Most cheaper hotels have free, high-speed internet, so it seems counter-intuitive that a more expensive hotel would charge so much for internet use. The hotel is in a nice location, right by the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or. It is a bit far from the main part of the city, about \u00b14km, but there is a bit right outside the hotel (line 58) which goes directly to Bellecour (line 58 - at Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain, right behind the hotel, goes to the city center). Tip: the day tickets for the public transportation (un jour - 4,70\u20ac) are only for that particular day, and don't last for 24 hours. Taxi to the hotel is extremely expensive, it was 60\u20ac for us on the way there. On the way back, we used the bus (line C1 from 'Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain') and an airport shuttle (6,70\u20ac for young people). In August, however, the metro will have a stop at the airport (one way on the metro is 1,60\u20ac).", "title": "Very nice and clean hotel", "user": "palypat", "date": "July 26, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 72357048}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2010, traveled on business", "text": "Hilton Lyon is situated slightly on the outskirts of the city centre, but that's a plus if you're arriving by car. We drove from Bordeaux, found our way easily and were valet parked upon arrival. It's only a short taxi ride to anything which is happening in Lyon, and there is the fabulous Parc de la Tete d'Or on your doorstep. We asked for a room with the best view, and instead of overlooking the Rhone as expected, we were given a spacious room with balcony overlooking the Parc and its lakes - and it was indeed a very beautiful view. We reserved a larger room on the Executive floor with access to the lounge overlooking the river. We left the balcony door open for natural ventilation but found it a little noisy at night when people left nearby restaurants, though this was not a major problem. The other reason we'd chosen to stay at the Hilton is that it's part of Renzo Piano's huge complex, and having stayed at the Meridien in Torino which is also his design, we wanted to compare the two. It was a short stay for business, so we didn't have time to sample the restaurants, but it's a thumbs up for location and service. Pricey, but worth it.", "title": "Arriving in Lyon by car?
