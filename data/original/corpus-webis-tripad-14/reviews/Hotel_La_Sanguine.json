It is less than a hundred yards from the Place De Madelaine, and for those readers who know Paris, that it an excellent location. The rooms are not that large, the towels could be thicker, and there is no elavator for the three floors(staff will help with luggage), and those are the downside. The rest is more than adequete and an absolutely great value. A hidden gem with an extremely helpful staff and a good breadfast. The street is rather quiet and make sure you try to avoid staying in the room on the same floor as the receptionist area. I have stayed in five star hotels and this property is more than acceptable.", "title": "Amazing best location and value", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "calmkey", "date": "October 19, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5970961, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location and value"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Charming", "text": "We stayed three nights three nights at the La Sanguine at the start of our honeymoon. We had had the hotel recommended to us and weren't disappointed. Our room was small, but was comfortable and spotless.

One afternoon, the proprietor brought us out some pain au chocolat straight outof the oven. Delicious. The location is unbeatable.

The entire staff morning and night are very friendly so no need to worry about unhelpful or rude parisian staff. The location is absolutely fantastic so would have to say that you can't beat the central location of the hotel especially if you're interested in checking out sites related to the DaVinci Code (note that Jean Cocteau was a former patron of the hotel!). Finally the only negative feedback I would have to say is that our room was opposite the front desk and although I was happy with the entire room, cleanliness etc. I would recommend staying on the other floors to avoid hearing folks checking in/out in the morning and night. Note that there is only one room in this situation and the staff had asked if I wanted to change rooms but seeing as I had finally settled into my atmosphere (I have trouble sleeping in new locations so nothing to do with the hotel itself) I opted to not change rooms. Overall would recommend and note that when comparing hotels on this site this is a way above average 2star locale!!!!", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 23, 2006", "id": 5376749}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "Location good, AC cold, beds comfy, street quiet @ night, owners friendly and breakfast yummy. . Hot chocolate, chocolate croissants, fresh bread, and good coffee! Not too expensive for us and our two teenagers in two rooms, esp. for the area.

The main attraction I feel about this hotel is the very friendly hotel owners and staff which makes the place very personal and gives that special touch that you do not get at the more luxurious hotel.

We were looking for small hotel experience, family-run, clean, quaint, very \"Paris\". After reading the reviews, we found the Sanguine. We found alll those things, but our room was just way too small, probably about 3x3 meters, including the bathroom. I assume that this room was once without bath, which would have been manageable, but for two people it was too small (I literally had to lie on the bed or go in the bathroom, while my wife was getting dressed.) The view was an air shaft. We had a fourth floor room (no elevator). The fourth floor ceiling are only about 7 feet high while the lower floor seemed more reasonable. There was one very strong a/c which worked great, but it was noisy and hard to adjust in such a small room, it was great to cool down the room, but we certainly couldn't sleep with it at night.
