New ownership but same high-quality sevice. Starting from the complimentary sweet breakfast with pastries and coffee (better than two years ago - pastries are amazing), gorgeous rooms (all ocean view), free chairs + umbrella at the beach in front of the hotel and also a beautiful private pool on the hotel 1st floor. Try the \"bites-on-the-go\" menu pool-side, all dishes are amazing, burger as well! Last but not least, one night I had a problem with my toilette, I called our personal assistan at the reception and in 2 minutes there were 3 people in the room, fixing the problem, cleaning everything and going out respecting our privacy, it was a rare example of efficency and 5 stars service.

The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very nicely decorated and very clean. We paid for an ocean view room and it was well worth the extra money. We had an amazing full view of the beach, which was lovely in the morning when the sun streams through the windows. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We never walked past a staff member who didn't say hello, and the staff at the front desk really went out of their way to answer any question or request that we had. While South Beach is full of places to eat, the best meals that we had were actually at the hotel. They have a very nice patio that serves great food. We loved the free beach chairs and umbrellas that the hotel provides at the beach, which is directly across the street from the hotel. We did not spend any time at the pool so can only say that it's very small and situated at the back of the building with no view at all. There were two negatives that prevent me from giving a 5 star review. (1) The strip of Ocean Ave that the hotel is located on is full of VERY loud bars where the workers stand on the street soliciting you to come in so walking to and from the hotel is like running a gauntlet of touts. When the bar next door is hosting its drag queen show, you can't even approach the hotel from that direction as the street gets so full of people. (2) The bathrooms in some of the rooms are separated from the rest of the room by a clear glass wall so when you shower, you are exposed to the rest of the room, which could be uncomfortable for those who don't like to put on a show while washing their private parts. We stayed in the hotel at the beginning and the end of our trip so we had two different rooms - one had this feature and one didn't. One additional note - an 18% gratuity is added automatically to every bill so check your receipts before adding any additional tips. All in all, it was a very nice stay on both occasions. I think we would stay there again if we ever went back.", "title": "Great Hotel with Excellent Staff", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "amc4_11", "date": "August 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 136965792}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is gorgeous.

The food was excellent. We received free entry to club mansion & club set & line jumpers.we told him next time he has to join us! We took a tour of the everglades.! Brent made our trip perfect.

This of course has its down side, as this end of the beach has become a little downmarket and draws the crowds. I had a room right next door to a very loud bar - which can certainly kick any tranquility out of an evening in your room. However, the room itself was very nice. Spacious and well decorated, with everything you would expect from a quality hotel. The work finish was a little cheap in places - but overall very satisfying. The staff are friendly enough, but you very much have to approach them and the execution of service is a bit shoddy and laid back. There is no management presence and this might be the route of the hotel's problems. The restaurant pushes out some nice cuisine - but nothing earth shattering (they do a lovely Cobb Salad). There is a pool, that is tucked away round the rear of the hotel - so perfect to escape from the crowds. However, no spa (only in-room treatments can be arranged).
