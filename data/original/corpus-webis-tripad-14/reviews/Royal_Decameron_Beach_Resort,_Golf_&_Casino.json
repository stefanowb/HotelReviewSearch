They have excellent security, the grounds and hotel are well kept. The beds are a bit hard, but I have found that most hotels have the same issure, unless you stay at the Sheraton in Canada or the US. I have food allergies and there was always something I could eat. They have a good variety for people without allergies, and fairly decent even if you do have allergies. The staff was always pleasant. The beach was beautiful! We didn't go in the ocean, they do have some jelly fish, but we only saw 2 incidents of jelly fish stings and the staff was very helpful to those in need. You can either take or buy (cheap) a pool mattress and use it to lay on the lounge chairs at the beach and pool, and if you go to the watersports desk at the beach they will inflate it for you at no charge. They even have board games that you can borrow at the watersports desk, which is great if you have kids. We would definitely go back to this hotel. I think it is a good resort for couples, and families. We went as a couple, but wouldn't hesitate to bring our daughter with us next time. The only down side is there is a lot of stairs, so if you have trouble walking, you may want to reconsider, otherwise go and have a great time.", "title": "Fabulous!", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "TropicsOntario", "date": "October 15, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 119333304}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled on business", "text": "I am struggling to come up with any positives for my 4 night stay here.

The rooms are old school and you actually need a key to get in, if you want a second key (and the rooms only have two keys) you need to leave a $15 deposit on the key. We paid extra for ocean view (don't confuse that with ocean front), it just means you should be able to see part of the ocean. They put us on the ground floor with our patio right on a main path to the adult pool and a popular walk way to and from the disco. Their was also a bright light streaming into our room right by my bed. Also the first night after checking a bit of the resort out, we had a huge black bug on the floor. The next day my dad went and talked to the front desk about moving to a higher up room with a better view.

My family and I dressed up every night, but their was a lot of people in board shorts, hats, pajamas, and a lot of other clothes that are not considered dressy. The Italian was my least favorite, Japanese teriyaki reminded me of Edo fast food restaurant, catch-of-the-day was good but don't order anything over an above the catch-of-the-day because you can go to Woody's next door and pay WAY less then what the resort was charging. The only thing with the a la carte is that you had to still get up to get your salad (and I say that very loosely), soup and dessert.

This building is an excellent location, directly below lobby 2, and immediately next door to the Buffet Atlantico, and directly across from Cafe Med, which is a beach bar/snack bar during the day and an al la carte restaurant at night. The only bad part about this location was for New Years Eve, they set up a huge stage that took over the entire pool, which is direclty in front of the buffet next door, and had live entertainment and dancing until fairly late, so it was very loud. The hotel put on a fabulous fireworks display on New Years Eve that we were able to watch from our balcony. They had three sets of fireworks going off in three different locations on the beach. It was very impressive.", "user": "HappyToBeFromVA", "date": "January 19, 2012", "id": 123328546}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "If you bought already the trip... too bad.
