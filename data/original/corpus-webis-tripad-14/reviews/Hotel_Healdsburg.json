The complimentary breakfast was one of the best \"hotel breakfasts\" I have experienced. The architecture, furnishings, ambience were above our expectations. The little touches like complimentary fresh ice tea, lemonade and water bottles in the lobby for guests to enjoy were well received.

We loved it! Healdsburg is a great little town and wonderful square with plenty of tasting rooms and restaurants within very close walking distance from the Hotel Healdsburg. HH is very modern. The lobby is comfy and they offer a great complimentary breakfast with fruit, toast, cereals, tea, fritattas, and lox and bagels. Our room was very nice, modern. Beds were comfy. Large bathroom with a soaking tub and separate showers. We had two great massages at the spa, however, spa staff was a little unorganized or less attentive than most. For example, there were no towels for the jacuzzi area. The pool area is nice and the lounge chairs are fabulous! There was not poolside food or drink service offered the whole 2 hours we were there though. The concierge was very helpful in making travel and dinner arrangements for us. We used Jason at Vine Rover Tours to tour wineries in the area and LOVED IT! It's expensive but totally worth it to us and made it a truly once in a lifetime experience. We visited many smaller, unique wineries we would never have known to visit otherwise with wine that can't be purchased in AR. Okay, here's my only problem with the Hotel Healdsburg, at 5:30 am both mornings we woke up to what we though was a trash truck but it lasted hours!!! It sounded like it was literally in our room. There was consistent clanging and you could hear the reverse warning alarms on the truck. It was absolutely miserable!!! I thought after the first day that it was just a fluke but it happened the next day as well. I told the desk clerk at check out and she seemed clueless and just said Sorry. Our airport drive told us it's actually construction and they're building a new commerical area there. The hotel really needs to do something about the start time--5:30 am on the dot is just ridiculous! Also, the hotel forgot our wake-up call. Good thing I also set my blackberry. We loved the property and the area but could have used a few more hours of sleep! I can't say enough how loud it was!

There was NO MGR on premise to assist with the problem, the spa was now closed. The front desk sent a parking attendent to look for the necklace in the spa compound with no success. I was informed that the substitute manager had left the premises early at 6PM and there was no one that could help me other than the parking attendent who was also bartending? The mgmt and owners refuse to acknowledge any responsibility for the thievery and neglect in handling my personal property. They are labeling the necklace as lost, lost by whom? THEM!
