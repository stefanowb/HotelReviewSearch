When we arrived late afternoon we were informed we had been upgraded to a queen deluxe. In our room we had 2 queen beds, massage chair, good size fridge, microwave, jacuzzi tub for two and a bathroom with tub / shower. Flat screen tv, desk, table and two chairs and large bureau. Everyone at the front desk was helpful.The room itself was clean, looked a little tried and drab but large. Working ac unit. I sat in the lobby to use the wifi and heard the front desk recommending take out places and they had all the menus on hand. There is also a non heated pool which has an open ceiling. My kids enjoyed that, little too cold for me! Breakfast was included and sufficient. Plastic cutlery and paper plates, fine by me if that keeps the cost down! Toast, waffles, cereal, yogurts, strawberries, donuts, pastries, pop tarts, nutra grain bars. People did seem to be having a problem with the waffle iron! I was hesitant about booking the room because of the poor reviews but I am very glad I did. The hotel was less than 10 minutes to second beach.
