The views of the lake are absolutely beautiful and the hotel is situated in pleasantly landscaped grounds. The accommodation is in the form of self catering suites which are huge. The rooms are obviously fairly newly decorated and look fresh and airy. The lounge also features an open plan kitchen which is fairly well equipped. For those who don't want to cook there is a bistro in the hotel but we found the food here to be pretty average. Breakfast is good with a choice of hot and cold options.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 7, 2006", "id": 5317597}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Better Location", "text": "A great place to stay for a relaxing & peaceful time.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 22, 2005", "id": 4131948}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Resort in beautiful setting", "text": "My husband and I stayed at Lake Pleasant with our 10 years old daughter and had a wonderful time. The setting is very picturesquem and we were able to enjoy the perfect lakeside view from our room - great for bird watching. Room itself was spacious and large, with a bed in the lounge area for my daughter. Everything you would expect of a hotel at thislevel was provided. The room was nicely decorated with some good original artwork on the walls. Housekeeping was immacualte. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Lake Pleasant is a great place to get away from it all and enjoy mature.
