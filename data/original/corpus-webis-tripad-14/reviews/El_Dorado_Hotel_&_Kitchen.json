My boyfriend and I booked this hotel based on the location and wanting a cool, updated place to stay. We chose a bungalow room after reading reviews that other rooms were too noisy. The hotel location is perfect... right on the square across from Girl and the Fig and next to Sunflower Caffe. It has all the right ideas for a boutique style hotel with an upbeat restaurant and a contemporary lounge area with a cool fireplace. It misses the mark everywhere else though. The registration desk is basically the hostess stand for the restaurant and it isn't very inviting. We arrived at prime dinner hour, so it was very noisy and we thought we were in the wrong spot for check-in. The guy showed us to our bungalow room which was out back behind the pool and parking lot. It was very cold out, so he took us through the restaurant, but carrying all our luggage while people were eating was quite awkward. The room has a private patio with a high fence that makes it feel like a dog pen. The front desk guy said, \"this room has the biggest bathroom in the hotel!\" Well the bathroom was huge, but the actual room was fairly small. We thought we were getting a king bed, but it was a queen. The bed itself was not very comfortable. The worst part was the A/C unit was very loud. We had to run the heat and the unit would shut on/off very frequently, waking us up each time. I've never had this problem before at a hotel. Main positives: it is VERY clean, has updated look (furniture and fixtures). We ate a light lunch in the cafe and the food and service were great! The room just wasn't worth the money and did not meet any of our expectations.", "title": "Quite disappointed but location can't be beat.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "CassieS84", "date": "November 14, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 145390798}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We were in a \"bungalow room\" behind the pool and separated from the main hotel. We had to walk through the bar area to an outdoor hallway, past the trash, past the always busy laundry room, through a gate, through the pool area, through another gate and into our room. I knew we were in trouble when the front desk guy who left his post to take us on this journey, said...This room has the best shower on the property! Actually looked like the room had once been designed as a handicapped room- the bathroom was almost as big as the room. We had reserved a king bed and got a queen that actually squeaked and sagged when sat upon. The lock on the door was defective and unable to be closed unless you used the key and brute strength. Complained immediately and was told they were fully booked, so we made the best of it. My son was in a room that faced onto the square and found it quite noisy. The location is great! We were able to walk out to dinner and to the mission and Vallejo's home. The manager seemed to be in hiding, but the young staff tried to be helpful and ended up apologizing a lot. The pool is very small and the chaises could use some new covers. There is limited parking in the back, and then you are on your own. I really didn't think it was worth $225 plus tax per night.

The bathroom was also very clean with good light and excellent towels. It was bright and I had to go there all the time to look for things. We were a group attending a wedding and my nephew's room was also so dark, that at a point he put on a gray pant matching a black jacket. The bathroom window needs a shade since other guests can see you from their balconies and the closets are very tiny with very little hangers. I requested extra ones and I could only get two, when I really needed four. You can hear noise and conversations from other rooms. Service in the restaurant is very good and the girl at the front desk is very nice and helpful.
