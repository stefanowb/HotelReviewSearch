We were lucky to be allocated a room after a short wait - usually check-in is after 2pm. The 'first' room we were allocated had a double bed and a 'day bed'. It was nice and clean with a balcony with good views across the city. We asked for the bed to be made up for our 12yr old and went out to do some sight-seeing. Upon returning late in the evening, the 3rd bed was still not made up and after several calls to Reception, they admitted that they had given us the wrong room for 3 people, but would send up a roll-out bed (removing the day bed). As it was late and we were tired, we requested that we change room instead of having to move furniture around - they obliged and we went next door which was a 'family' room with 2 doubles. The room allocation error was our only glitch and the new room was very nice, clean and the beds lovely and comfy. Although we faced the front of the hotel, the rooms were very quiet and we heard no traffic noise at all.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "6800christine", "date": "August 19, 2007", "id": 8450531}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hotel offers a buffet breakfast which we had the following morning.
