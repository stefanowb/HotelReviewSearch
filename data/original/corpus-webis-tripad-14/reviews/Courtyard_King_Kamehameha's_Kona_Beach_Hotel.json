Loved the location close to shops and restaurants. The hotel has done some nice updates and the wifi was decent. The computer facilities were top notch. Thought the service at the desk was pretty good and maid service was above normal. Rooms a bit small but nice lanai with table and chairs. Parking 10 a day bit steep. Restaurant hannu was ok but closed early but quite normal for kona. Pool was small and u had to get up early to get a chair. The beach is good for kona because beaches are scarce in the area. Snorkeling and paddle boarding is great there.

Do not mistake it for anything more than a 3-star hotel. They give you a room key and then you're on your own. The rooms are very standard and maid service is sporatic. Our first 2 days they cleaned our room while we were on a morning excursion, but a few days into the trip we had to beg the front desk for new towels after 2pm. Bar service at the pool was a joke. No drinks allowed beyond the bar (ie not it the pool or jacuzzi or by the beach) so you have to finish your drink in your wet clothes and then go back. It's too chilly in december for those rules! But they ignore rules like no one under 15 allowed in the hottub without supervision. Several times we were smothered with unsupervised 5-year-olds partying it up in the hot tub. To sum up, it's clean and convenient but not a full-service hotel. It should be cheaper for the lack of service. Not horrific, but definitely not nice.", "title": "Terrible service.

Lobby looks nice, but a lot of the room and hall work looks shoddy and already in need of some TLC. When we checked in we had some problems, dirty bedspread, tv that didn't work and the need for the maintanece man to show up twice in one evening. We were offered another room, but the view was worse and dedcided to stay put. No comp for the problems we did have which I always think is necessary when problems arrise like this the first day! Like other post state, the bathroom is small and you may not think its a big deal, but it is when only one person can fit at a time and you are trying to get ready. Besides the above issue the hotel is located in a great location. You are right downtown in Kailiua and walking distance to many shops, stores and resturants. Downtown has it all. We spent 7 nights during Christmas and enjoyed the walks into town on the boardwalk and all the fun little shops. However, the hotel beach is really not! Need a car to go to the nice beaches of Kona and there are many. My suggestion is get to the beach early so parking and beach space is not a problem, by 11:00 things begin to get crowded.

The front desk said \"You don't get a view if you use your AAA card\"...but this is exactly what I paid UP for, an upgraded room. Wanting this to be a special night, we asked to move, they had us wait 30 minutes until they could give us another room~ this next room had the king bed and the view but also a horrible screeching sound from inside the wall (sounding like a broken fan belt or something, ear plugs wouldn't have been good enough). Next room, king bed with no view but QUIET which is all we cared about after lugging our suitcases down to the lobby twice. The staff seemed way understaffed and stressed out, not their fault.

No, it is not one of the big luxury resorts. However, it is in one of the best locations as you can walk to all of the restaurants and shops in Kona---a beautiful walk along the coast. With the luxury resorts, you have to drive a good distance everywhere. The pool area and beach are quite nice. The rooms were just okay in size but very clean. The resort---lobby, art gallery, pool area, restaurant---are nicely done. The ABS store on the premises was very convenient. The only reason I didn't give this hotel a 5 star/excellent rating is that I found it quite lacking in the \"aloha\" spirit. The front desk staff didn't seem to be concerned at all that we didn't get the room we booked (we ended with 2 queens instead of a kind for our 10th anniversary). The only response we got was you aren't guaranteed a type of room. Really? Also, sometimes the service around the pool bar and in the restaraunt was sketchy....the staff seemed stressed.

The internet was slow and did not work half the time. There are only 3 washing machines for the entire hotel of 450 rooms. I went to the laundry room on numerous occasions and either had to wait a LONG time, not do the laundry or go to a laundry mat across the street. The service in the restaurant was horrible. I could never get coffee with the breakfast buffet, so started making coffee in the room and bringing it down to breakfast. Often got our own water because no one waited on us.
