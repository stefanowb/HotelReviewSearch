Our room was so comfortable with all the amenities you could ask for.

The renovations downstairs in lobby and bar area are lovely and it is a beautiful hotel when you drive up the beautiful driveway and enter the hotel. However, our room was not up to the same standard. The rooms were comfortable but the decor and furniture is very tired and badly need of updating - definitely not 4* hotel room. Had dinner in the bar which was very good-restaurant manager was very accommodating and helpful for our group and the food was lovely. Service was a bit slow but it was very busy so can understand that. Waiting staff at breakfast was a different story- they did not seem to interested in us and was very hard to get their attention even though the restaurant was very quiet at the time - they spent most the their time gossiping in the corner until a manager came in. The food at breakfast however was very good-nice selection of hot and cold food. I found some of the reception staff were very rude and not interested in serving guests. The fire alarm went off at 5am in the morning - when I mentioned it when checking out, the girl just said someone drunk set it off and that was the end of the conversation. Even though this was not their fault, an apology on behalf of the hotel would have been nice. I was waiting for a friend in the lobby and noticed their attitude with a number of guests-not just me.

I was looking for somewhere in Kildare in which to stay the night, and a friend recommended this place. I had no idea or expectation. Accommodation and a meal was pricey, but not exceptionally so for a four star hotel. When we arrived, I have to say that my expectations were very much exceeded. This hotel is absolutely enormous. Our bedroom was in the Belling section, and was huge. The furnishings were antique and cosy. We had a four poster bed. We both slept like logs. The bathroom was nice too, with twin sinks, jacuzzi bath and nice shower.We found it spectacular. One thing I liked too was that it was not stiflingly warm in the hotel or bedrooms. I find that a problem staying in hotels normally. Can be very hard to sleep indeed.The restaurant was exceptional. We both had potato and coconut soup for starters. Delicious. Then both had hereford beef. Absolutely beautiful. The dessert was out of this world. It was a chocolate fudge cake with black cherries, cherry sauce and ice cream. There was a chocolate swirl with honeycomb sticking out of the ice cream. The chef really knows his stuff. Lovely artistic flair and delicious taste. The service in the restaurant was exceptional. They have a lot of staff on. There seems to be a person for everything. That's good. We thought the breakfast service was excellent too. The full Irish breakfast was lovely, especially the sausages. My wife had waffles with syrup, which was lovely too. We found the reception staff to be very friendly on our departure. They were a bit under pressure on our arrival !
