First, many months ago when we were searching for hotels we first stipulated that we needed to be in a great location in London, and after shopping many of the top 100 hotels in Mayfair, Green Park, Oxford Street, and Knightsbridge, the Halkin was quick to respond to our inquiries with a reasonable offer for a \"jr suite\" connected to a \"1 bedroom\" - the two connecting rooms were perfect for our family. When I say reasonable, of course we had to \"close our eyes\" to crazy London prices, but at least they discounted from \"list prices\" versus many other hotels that did not want to flinch. Anyways, upon arrival the service was friendly and professional, and all staff were eager to help... if we asked \"is their a gym downstairs\"... they said \"come with me, let me show you the gym\"; when we checked in the room they did not include in their standard ammenities a flat iron and ironing board... but when we called to inquire- within 4 minutes one was delivered to our door... and ditto- there was not \"in room coffee\", and we travel with our own instant coffees we bring... but we called to inquire about a hot water heater and some mugs.. and again within minutes delivered to the room was a hot water heater and mugs. One time during the week, I screwed around with the TV settings- I was programming way into the menu settings and screwed up the TV and Computer relationship (TV is connected to interactive computer) and could not get the video on the TV (only the audio). When we left the room that day, I left message at front desk that TV was broken- but for them to send someone who really knows the programming (and I had feeling they could not fix)... and upon returning later in day... presto it was fixed. In passing, and very candidly later in the week my wife said \"this hotel is quick, on the ball, they hop right away\". So, service is A++. Room was just fine, modern amenities in an old city; including large all marble tiled bathroom with modern fixtures, super hot water and high pressure shower heads. Clean, no signs of wear and tear, or of previous guests finger-prints, crumbs, etc. Not super spacious, but again as London Hotels go, it was bigger than most. Room was quiet, although we saw many newspapers hanging from other doors in hallways, we never heard other rooms or guests while we were in our room.", "title": "Great Hotel, Great Location", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "gtpatton", "date": "June 30, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 33602913}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "So, great service, modern & clean room... but the huge bonus is location, location, location! 2 blocks from Hyde Park subway stop- we came straight away from Heathrow with our carry-on bags (4 people with 4 bags).

And on way toward Harrods, find trendy Montcomb street with great boutique grocery store, Starbucks, and about 4-5 restaurants. Around these neighborhoods between Halkin and Harrods, I have never seen so many Mercedes, BMW, Rolls Royce, Bentleys, Ferrarri, Lamborgini... and many more just parked out on street in open (not garaged). My 16 year old daughter was taking her picture next to each prize find. Also, only about 6 minutes (3 blocks) up to Knightsbridge... family eating at \"Pizza on the Green\" or \"The Spagetti House\". Many shops too. In the morning, wake up and run two blocks to huge Hyde Park- for nice 3-4 mile jog around park circumference. Or just enjoy during day.

After our flight we have collected our luggage and afterwards had taken the Tube ( Underground ) to Hyde Park Corner - from here The Halkin is only around a five ( 5 ) minute walk away. We had stayed at this magnificent little gem of a hotel between the 18th of April and the 20th of April 2009. The Halkin is located at the optimal named Halkin Street just two streets behind the Lanesborough Hotel, but unlike the Lanesborough, The Halkin is in a very quiet and romantic - less busy - area. Having said that the location is just optimal because on the one side Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Sloane Street are only a 5 to 10 minutes walk away to the left side of the Hotel entrance and to the right is Mayfair and Hyde Park. Just amazing situation, Folks! That' s what we call walking London. We had arrived at the hotel at around 12 noon, but couldn' t check-in, because our room was not ready yet. No problemo for us because in the meantime we had lunch at the Creperie at Harrods on the 3rd floor instead, just wonderful - think beautiful presented crepes incl. Pear Helena and others plus hot chocolate and british cloudy apple juice - highly recommended. At around 14: 00 pm we had now checked into our Superior Double room no. 402 for 2 nights / 3 days. As complimentary welcome drinks - which we could choose - we had taken freshly pressed orange juice for two. This was a very nice and welcoming touch. Our luggage was already there in the room. The room was large and very very well presented to us in a condition which can only be described as superb in every way. Here is what we found, Folks: a superb large bed with raw organic silk covering and finest linen, extra fluffy bed, Large LCD TV by Sony Bravia incl. the following channels out of a choice of 63 incl. CNN, Sky News, Sky Sports 1, 2, 3, Xtra, CNBC, BBC 1, 2, 3, 4, News 24 and many many more plus Bloomberg - also TV channels from Japan, Germany, France and the Middle East - superb choice. The TV had also a built-in Juke box with hundreds of music tracks from around the world to choose from plus radio stations and free Internet access. We had a very cosy - club style - lounge area with white/cream leather chairs and black coffee table, free water from Wales, coasters, stirrers and an ice bucket. We had three telephones in all incl. one corldless phone on the writing main desk. Our room incl. also the following: 6 light sources, writing paper, envelopes, pens, fully stocked mini-bar incl. Voss water from Norway, Grey Goose Vodka plus Snow Queen Vodka, Lucozade Energy drinks, Tyrrells Crisps, Hendrick' s Gin, Bombay Saphire Gin, Juices from Sunraysia - Australia - incl. Cranberry, apple, mango and orange - all reasonable priced like for example the Voss water was 4 \u00a3 Sterling and the juices had been also 4 \u00a3 Sterling each. We had also exotic black and brown polished lacquered wooden furniture - think Thailand or Asia as a whole -, the mini-bar was also very well intergrated inside the main wardrobe. We also have found 18 hangers in the wardrobe, 24h laundry service, 24h butler service - via button -, 24h room service menu, Turn-down services available each day until 22:00 pm with 2x free water provided ( still ). The hairdryer by Revlon was located in the night table, also there had been on our room architectural prints on the wall near the writing desk and the lounge area in the corner, our view outside the window was into an private romantic english garden - backside of the Halkin - this view was just nice away from the more busy areas which normally is the norm in a city like London. We also had an Airconditioning + Butler + Light panel display built into the wall, Special suit boy hanger which holds a formal jacket and trousers, we enjoyed the highly discreet and professionell but friendly service at the Halkin. The Halkin was our first Como operated hotel and co-incidently it was also the first Como Hotel when it first opened in 1991 - The Halkin is the sister hotel to the Metropolitan London and Bangkok plus a few other hotels throughout the world on fine selected locations incl. exotic Bali and Bhutan. The Halkin is also a member of The Leading Small Hotels of the World. The Como Hotel group was founded by Singaporean enterpreneur Christina Ong and is also based on the exclusive Como Shambala concept - a cross between healthy and meaningful lifestyle - which also included Como Shambala Urban Escape Spas and a beauty line of fine products based around the same concept. All in All and integrated lifestyle concept which happens to include some of the best hotels, spas and restaurants in the world. Moving now on to our bathroom, Folks! We found the following incl. fine marble all the way in shades of grey, black and brown, separate bathtub - deep - and shower - large - good pressure - in both! There was also a nice sink, enough space for cosmetic products, we had a stunning 4 bathrobes plus towels of various sizes which all had been white and fluffy - comfortable - simply sublime. The bathroom amenities came all from the Como Shambala Signature line of products incl. Shampoo, Hairconditioner, soap, shower gel, body lotion, sponge, shower cap and oriental porcelain wear for the toothbrushes and the Kleenex. Once again we have to say, all in all a most perfect bathroom in terms of space and quality. All Como Shambala products were also available to buy in larger sizes incl. all beauty products plus the Halkin branded umbrella, shopping bag and even the laundry bag can be bought in the hotel. This hotel comes in highly recommended from us because it really was and is faultless to the point that one of us had birthday on the 19th of April 2009 - him - and the Halkin delivered unexpectantly a full-sized bottle of Louis Roederer Champagne as a real birthday gift. Simply sublime drinking for two days! Such gestures make a good hotel great! On the first night we had availed of the room service which was as you and we had expected just perfect incl. Prawn sandwich, The signature Halkin Burger with fries, water - large bottle from Wales -, superb tasting chocolate ice cream! The food was superb and the service was prompt even the removal of the room service dinner table was within 5 minutes of calling! Our breakfast on both occassions in the morning where full english - but on the lighter and healthier side than usual - which was superb! The breakfast was served at the famous Nahm Restaurant - 1 Michelin Star - David Thompson - Executive Chef - Troy Sutton - the service even at breakfast was discreet and exact. They did even know that we really like cherry yoghurt without telling them, they simply delivered! Magic! This is our Como Oasis in the heart of London! We had also superb Thai Dinner at the NAHM restaurant on the evening of the 19th of April 2009 - his birthday - see our separate review on tripadvisor - under NAHM RESTAURANT -! Here comes the Bar at the Halkin which is on the front of the hotel beside the lobby and the concierge, once again a very good example how things should be! The Bar incl. one old fashioned - modern - in tune with the hotel, the halkin breeze - is excatly what the Halkin is - you simply want more / cocktails or nights that is, Folks! The Cappuccino was perfect and frothy plus the Mango juice was also judged perfect. The Bar has the atmosphere of the rest of the hotel a lot of light colours, organic silk, nice and chic tables to go with, just like the rest of the hotel - chic and meaningful without the undue fussiness. In our opinion the hotel was relaxing, modern, oriental, inspiring, thai, asian, fresh, outside the norm and timeless with the right amount of services and luxuries for it' s class. A perfect example what a hotel can be, when it wanted it to be! The Halikin has 41 rooms and suites and suitable for business, pleasure, couples and even families - they got adjoining rooms -! This was our very very nice stay for 2 nights / 3 days at the famous Halkin Hotel London - Part of the Como Hotelgroup. We also recommend a visit to the Design Museum London - which we had also done - perfect! Birthday' s and other days we and you should once again choose the Halkin in future for a very perfect stay in the heart of London. Do not forget to FLY, STAY, EXPLORE!
