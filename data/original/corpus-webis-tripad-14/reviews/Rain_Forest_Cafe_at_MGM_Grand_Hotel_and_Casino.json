The restaurant itself is ideally located and superbly decorated in its rainforest theme. The one thing about Vegas is the service you recieve is second to none. With tips being so important, you are treated like royalty. However this was not the case here, with our waiter barely muttering 2 words to us for the 2 hours we were here. We both decided on a beer, with standrad burger and fries. Our waiter took nearly 30 minutes from enterring to take our order, the place was emptying so this seemed very excessive. We then waited a further 30 minutes from finishing to recieving our bill, due to the fact our waiter had gone missing. In the end we walked out and placed the exact money at the counter. The food itself was plain fare, we have had far better for a lot less in many places here. Would i visit this venue again? Never in a million years. Its the worst service i have ever recieved in any place i have eaten.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Shane B", "date": "October 13, 2013", "id": 180793350}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Noisy But Otherwise Good", "text": "Food was better than average, service was Goldilocks: not too much, not too little, just right.
