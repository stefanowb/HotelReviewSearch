Based on my comments the General Manager Rod OConner emailed & called me. He seemed so concerned regarding my negative comments. He offered me a gift certificate for 3day/2night stay. Surprise they wouldn't accept it! Completely booked! Not so, I checked their web site,(beforehand), they had availability @ a very resonable rate of $114.08. It was a week day rate. Not a weekend. NOPE...resort full. I feel the certificate is a scam just to quiet a guest who wasn't happy with the resort. I called the resort numerous times trying to use the certificate, leaving messages for the guest services manager, Elizabeth & faxing the certificate. Finally called the front desk & Wayne walked down to her office & transfered my call. Really to be told \"NO\". I feel they were ignoring my calls. We can afford to stay anywhere & there are much better resorts in the area.

I recall construction and admiring the Floridays property and so when I came back at the end of July 2012 we decided to stay there (especially given The Fountains was an extra $100 night). Overall, the hotel met our needs. We are a family of four and our 2 children (10 & 8) wanted a place where we had the amenities like home (kitchen, in-room washer dryer, separate bedrooms, etc.) plus pools, etc. to use whenever needed. We stayed for a week. The suite was well decorated but admittedly there were some issues with cleanliness. For starters, the decor (plants, bathroom/light fixtures, etc.) was notably covered with dust (my best estimate is that they hadn't been wiped in weeks) and when we reached for the frying pan the first night (it was stored in the oven) it was filled with grease (presumably from the previous tenant) that we had to immediately dump in the sink and clean in order to cook food via our late arrival. There are currently 6 buildings on the premises and we were housed in the last one (F) that literally took us 3 minutes to drive to after entering the premises given the maze required to get there and the MANY speed bumps throughout. Finally,the oven in our room heated unsatisfactorily (wanted to enjoy 2 pizzas late at night after returning from the parks) and the in-room safe indicated low battery and was inoperable. Mind you, the customer service we did use was GREAT, but we really don't like people coming in and out of our room for safety/security reasons and hence we just endured these 2 inconveniences. The negatives aside, I think this is a fine hotel for families. It's location on south I-Drive is great - it is the part that is not as highly commercialized as properties north of the convention center. It's an easy commute to groceries (Publix is less than a 1/4 mile away - albeit it closes at 10 if you are arriving to the area late or coming back from the parks late - then there is a 7-eleven and Walgreens up the road) and honestly its location avoids much of the heavier traffic areas in Orlando. The grounds are well maintained and safe. It has one main pool and a smaller less frequented one in the back that are nice - but no where as big/nice as the Fountains next door(although on the weekends they have a woman who entertains families and kids at the pool with games and prizes and she was a VERY enjoyable aspect of our vacation). The concierge was helpful although I was a bit put off that I had to spend $5 to use their business center computer for a few minutes so that I could print out my family's boarding pass. WiFi was good in the room and around the premises (MUCH better than the Fountains was!). If you are looking for something that is conveniently close to the Convention Center, Sea World (5 min) and the Disney parks (15 min) and Universal (20 min or so depending on I-4 traffic), and that has the amenities of home without breaking the bank, I would recommend the Floridays. It was ranked #1 by TripAdvisor at the time of my booking. It does deserve high marks, but I am surprised by how high its ranking is among the competitive properties/hundreds of hotels in the area (if I could afford it and needed to come to FL again, I would probably investigate the Fountains first).", "title": "Very good - depending on your needs & plans", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "g8rpsych", "date": "August 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136337724}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, jacuzzi and shower in the master bedroom and balcony, sofa bed in living room.

Jessie the concierge is amazing and very helpful. The rooms are very clean. We take a vacation every year with the kids and this was far and away the best hotel we have stayed in in terms of amenities, cleanliness and affordability. Will definitely stay there again. They have a shuttle that goes to the theme parks but we had a rental car through expedia. Beds were very comfortable. Pool is very clean and did not appear too crowded. They do have a cafe - selection for breakfast was somewhat limited but we usually prefer to cook while on vacation so no problem. Wal Mart not far away from hotel.
