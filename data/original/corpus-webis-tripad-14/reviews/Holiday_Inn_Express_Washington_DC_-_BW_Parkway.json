About a 20 min drive into D.C. or the metro station is a 5-8 min drive away. The staff is very courteous and meet your request with a smile. We stayed here because of the free breakfast bar, which was adequate. Just your basic breakfast with hot and cold breakfast items. Room was clean no ordors or carpet stains. Bathrooms wer clean as well but a little small. Location is a little shady. I never felt unsafe, but I wouldn't venture far with my family on foot. No sit down restaurants nearby, only a couple of fast food places. There is a walmart 2-3 minute drive away.", "title": "Meets your basic needs", "user": "csims70", "date": "May 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 2.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 110201891}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2011, traveled with family", "text": "Was pleasantly satisfied with our stay at this hotel.

The woman running the breakfast was very nice and helpful and kept the area fully stocked. The individuals at front desk at check out were friendly and efficient too. It was a quick ride (20 minutes) to where we were going in DC (the Newseum).

They welcome you when walking in, already have your room keys waiting so you dont have to wait in line. The rooms are clean from top to bottom. Trust me from staying in allot of hotels I inspect. The facilty has a gym with top of the line equipment. Plus this hotel has great breakfast, not just the complimentary. You have eggs,bacon, fruits,etc. they have enough parking plus they have cameras inside and outside the building. I felt secure while staying there.

The room is a bit small, but well maintained, clean, and comfortable. The carpet looks new and plush, the shower is big enough and very clean. This hotel is more affordable than other HIE's in the DC area, we are en route to NC. The front desk girl was very professional and we love the security feature of a key card to activate the elevator. Don't worry about the neighborhood we were just fine wandering around by car looking for food, the people go about their business minding their business, at least that has been our experience. We ended up right next door at the Pizza place which we highly recommend, there's a very nice choice of pastas and seafood. We had the spaghetti with sausage and a steak sandwich, don't bother to look for food around here because there's very limited choices such as a Burger King and a McDonald's and a smattering of small eateries. The good places are a fifteen minute drive from here, so either bring your food in or go next door, it is very affordable. Don't worry about the hotel it is not run down, it is very pleasant, granted we have seen some really upscale HIE's but this one is fantastic for the price, don't be a snob.", "title": "Great Hotel Good Value", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Myrts78", "date": "September 20, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 118344911}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "The building was older than expected and the rooms were not nearly as nice as we've seen in other Holiday Inn Express hotels.

Hotel is at an easily locatable place since it's on highway and even though it's on highway, it takes care of your needs because there is a Walmart right across the street and also an Italian restaurant adjacent. Rooms were though not very spacious but clean & nicely furnished. I completely loved the shower cabin with glass door since I do not like the idea of a shower-tub combination bathroom with baby-sized bathtubs. I really appreciated the concept of sound proof windows since the hotel is on highway. People at front-desk are very helpful. Breakfast bar was though not very lavish, but quit adequate. Fitness center is too small however it didn't matter much as we didn't use it. I was happy to see a soda vending machine & an ice machine right outside our room. Hallway is a beautifully decorated and elevators quit spacious. King sized bed was very comfortable. Housekeeping lady cleaned the whole bathroom floor unlike other hotels where they just change towels and empty the trash on the name of housekeeping. My husband forgot to carry his shaving kit and was happy to see that hotel provided shaving accessories free of cost. Only problem we faced during our stay was AC was very noisy and we couldn't sleep well with the AC on so we had to turn it off both nights however front desk guy was more than apologetic and offered us 2000 benefit priority club points for the inconvenience.
