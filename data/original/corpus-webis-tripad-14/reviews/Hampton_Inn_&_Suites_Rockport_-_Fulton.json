The only thing we ran into was being on the second floor, the people above us walked stepping heavily every night and morning. We never called the front desk about it because it was no fault of the hotel or the other guests. They were quiet all night and we were not bothered too much by it. The hotel is very close to the beach and we enjoyed the science building and the aquarium in Rockport. We will be returning to see the Fulton Mansion when it reopens.
