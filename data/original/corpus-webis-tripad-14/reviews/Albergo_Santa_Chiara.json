We had 5 days in Rome as a follow up to a cruise. The location is fantasitic, literally right next to the Pantheon - the area has limited car access which is heaven as it keeps the noise and dust down. Our room was quiet, the bedding wonderful, the AC perfect (so nice at the end of a long hot day), some English TV, the breakfast was good, and the staff extremely helpful and professional. Having 5 days, we compared this location with others and found it really great for access to all the sites plus the reduced noise factor was a major importance. Elevators are small, but that is Europe. We stayed on the 4th floor which we hiked to but we like any exercise. Our room opened up to small interior courtyard (no balcony), it was a triple with a comfy sofa bed (set a little back from the main area) that worked well for our 16 year old. It was spotless as well. Cab ride to airport is about 50 Euros (we chose a cab for a family of 3) and airport is about 35 minutes away. The hotel can you direct you to the small, inexpensive electric buses to get to some of the sites but we walked to most places except for Vatican and Borghese Villa Museum. Very good restaurants in area too. I would definitely stay there again.", "title": "Quadruple room ensuite...Great private balcony/patio", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Anthony C", "date": "July 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 135639303}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Loved Every Minute of It!", "text": "We really enjoyed staying at the Santa Chiara.

If you walk north you're two blocks from the Pantheon, and about five minutes from Trevi Fountain, and a few more minutes to the Spanish Steps. If you walk due west, you're about five minutes from Piazza Navonna. A little south of Piazza Navonna is Campo Di Fiori - also about five minutes from the hotel. If you walk due south, you're about five minutes from Capitol Hill, and a few more minutes to the Forum, Colosseum and Palatine Hill. If you walk just a couple blocks south you're at the major route to the Vatican, with a taxi stand right there for you (you could walk to the Vatican, but that's about fifteen to twenty minutes...) But the location's not all - the people taking care of us were exceptionally friendly and made every coming and going a pleasure. The concierge made a couple phone calls for us to help us with plans. The hotel offers (and don't pass it up!) pick up and drop off from the airport, for a per person fee. Even the driver was fun and punctual - waiting at the airport with our name on a sign! And at the hotel for our departure at least fifteen minutes early - we were still eating breakfast! The breakfast was amazing, and the waiters were wonderful. By the third morning our capuccinos and espressos were delivered moments after we arrived without us asking! There were meats, cheeses, pastries, coffee, a significant variety of teas, hot milk, cereal, fruit, biscotti...all included in your hotel price. Just remember, the beds anywhere in Europe (not just Rome) are much harder than American standards - but in summer the hotel has a/c and we used our heater to warm us up in winter. The shower was adjustable for height and had great pressure and hot water...You simply cannot find a better hotel in Rome - unless you choose to pay a fortune, but if you're reading this - you won't.", "helpfulness": 21, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 30, 2005", "id": 4155991}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2005", "text": "The nearby Pantheon and the piazza just in front of it is worth seeing -- an ancient temple embedded in a still-vibrant & bustling neighborhood, charming lanes with great little shops, a couple of Michelin one-star restaurants, & fabulous architecture. Just don't assume that you'll get a room with a window. And if you have to engage the front-desk staff for any reason, good luck. It is their place, I reminded myself, because the sense of hospitality is just not there. For example, after I paid the bill, they simply turned away without saying anything.
