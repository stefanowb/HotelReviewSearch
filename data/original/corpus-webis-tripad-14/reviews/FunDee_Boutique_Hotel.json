The breakfast was of high standard an infact the best coffee i have tasted. The hotel is best value for money and service is of high standard.

As well as this, the walls between the rooms are quite thin and you can hear most of what is going on next door. Again with this being Patong this can be deep into the night! I should state that we didn't have quiet nights in, but it would have been nice to get some sleep around 2am or so! Banging on the walls and trying to get some peace and quiet all proved fruitless.

We were used to getting awesome hotels at incredibly cheap prices. So when we saw the price here, and read the reviews, we thought we were getting the same thing. I would not really classify this as a hotel, it's more like a hostel. The rooms, while clean, were incredibly basic- no frills here. Our room had two beds and a fridge- in which everything cost extra. The bathroom is asian style, so expect a wet toilet and bathroom floor for the duration of your stay if you plan on showering there. The staff was nice, but we hit a huge booking snafu- we booked a great trip at a decent price, only to be told later we did not really book it (although we had paid) and that tour was now full. We were placed on another tour which was supposed to be comparable, only to find out when we got there is was anything but- and exactly what we had been hoping to avoid....and the guides on the tour spoke very little English (we had been told they spoke English) and instead found ourselves trying to decipher Russian! Needless to say the tour was not very meaningful- but perhaps this is the tour companies mistake more than the hotel's. When we complained to the front desk, who had booked all this for us, they were not willing to give us a refund or a discount, or any compensation what so ever. The location is good to walk around Phuket. My advice about Phuket is- really know what you are getting into before you stay here- it's not quite what we thought. Also, the lobby is open to the street at all times and we once saw a giant rat running around in there. Not really the hotel's fault, but gross.
