However, I will NEVER be back to this hotel and the quality of service I received from the hotel reception staff (in particular a girl named Savi) was the WORST I have ever received in my life, and I am a pretty frequent international traveler. Check-in at this hotel starts at 3 pm, and I and another traveler arrived at 2:45 pm. After checking in one guest before my party she asked us to wait 5 minutes in the lobby, which we did. She preceded to chat with other hotel workers (not regarding hotel business) for 15 minutes, after which she checked in other guests who arrived after us. When I finally reached the front desk (after standing in line again) she checked us in without explaining the unnecessary wait (especially since she let other guests check in early without waiting... therefore I assume it wasn't a matter of getting our particular room cleaned before we could check in... it was 2:45 pm for chrissake!) and while she looked sheepish after realizing that she had checked in a bunch of others and could probably tell that I was pretty mad, she did not apologize for the extended wait.
