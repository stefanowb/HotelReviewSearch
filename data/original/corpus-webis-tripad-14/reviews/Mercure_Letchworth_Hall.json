The hotel had a 30% off a 2 night stay and free glass of pimms offer at the time (August 2012) so we accepted this deal and they kindly upgraded our room to an executive room as they heard we had just got married. The room was very clean, spacious, modern and nothing was too much trouble for the staff there. Beautiful hotel with amazing decor and if you stay here you MUST have afternoon tea!! But make sure you get a 2 for 1 deal on groupon or similar site as its \u00a316.95 each! The restaurant dinner prices were quite expensive, but the bar menu was good value for delicious meals. This hotel is out in the middle of nowhere, so if you want to go out and explore, there really isn't much. However, we loved its location as it matched what we wanted - A quiet, relaxing getaway. There is a small town with a small high street of shops, but nothing special. There is a lovely park nearby and on a sunny summers day with ice cream in hand it was gorgeous! Very relaxing stay and we had use of gym and leisure facilities, which were great! On our second night there was a wedding being held at the hotel - the wedding reception room was just below our bedroom, so as you can imagine it was very loud. However, it wasn't a problem as we were newlyweds ourselves, but just wanted to include it in our review so future guests know. We had a lovely stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.", "title": "Beautiful hotel for a relaxing break", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "SarahSullivan", "date": "September 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 139493380}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed here for one Saturday night after a wedding.", "title": "Pleasant stay let down by breakfast", "user": "Burgessimo", "date": "September 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 139228642}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Upon arrival we had no queue before checking into the hotel.
