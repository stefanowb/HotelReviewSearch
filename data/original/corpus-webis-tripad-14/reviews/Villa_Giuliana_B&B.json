We stayed at the Villa Giulliana B&B in Lecce for three nights. The rooms were very well done and modern with AC (if you need it). The grounds of the B&B are like an amazing garden. Our parents were so impressed we had picked a place just outside of Lecce that was like an oasis. We had a nice breakfast each morning overlooking the gorgeous garden. True vacation...Andrea the proprietor was so helpful, he helped us make the most of our trip. He recommeneded beaches, restaurants and great driving tours. My wife and I will go back for a gettaway weekend. Make sure you have a car, you'll want one anyway to see all the great coastline around southern Lecce.

Maria di Leuca, the beautiful Ionio see. We higlhy recommend Villa Giuliana to anybody for the peaceful location, for its welcoming rooms, for fresh fruits you can pick up from the many trees in the garden, for quality vineries and restaurants nearby. It has been a relaxing and peasant holiday; we enjoyed beeing spoiled by the great cook Giuliana and appreciated the friendly suggestions of her son Andrea.
