Although our requirements weren't outrageous, they were short notice (imagine planning a small wedding in under two weeks), and the Innkeepers (Marcy and Jonathan) went out of their way to accommodate every one of our needs. The Inn itself was fabulous with plenty to look at and in a great location that's close to everything, but the service is what sets this place apart. The breakfast was awesome, and they're more than happy to cater to your dietary needs (they welcome the challenge). The rooms were all amazing (we rented almost all of them, and they were all beautiful), and everything was perfectly clean when we arrived, and the Innkeepers were more than happy to help us out in any way possible. In a time when service might not be the top priority of many businesses, the Tybee Island Inn shines as a gem.
