The experience was ok. The 1 bed apartment was fine- big enough and we did have plenty of windows. The bathroom is not great- the shower nozzle sprayed in various directions and the pressure was minimal. The fold out couch for the kids was made up upside down so the steel rungs were poking into them until we realized and remade it the right way up. Also when we requested more blankets there were none to be had. We were only given 3 towels for 4 of us. It was a good set-up for our young children though as they had a tv and we had one in our room too. This was handy for some down time in the evenings and to keep them quiet in the morning. Having a washer/ dryer in the kitchen was very handy. Reception staff were ok- although our booking was meant to include a free breakfast box and drink vouchers and this wasn't included. All in all ,it was just ok. I will try another property next time.", "title": "Just okay.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "L.Northam", "date": "July 23, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 18187448, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The apartment set-up was good with young kids.", "disliked": "\u2014 Shower."}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2008, traveled with family", "text": "I booked this apartment after having read the reviews on tripadvisor.

The rooms are plain but contemporary and comfortable. Furnishings are of an average or standard quality. As with most apartment style accomodation, the space is terrific and makes the idea of a small hotel room unappealing. At Pacific International on Exhibition, the lounge room is all glass at one end, overlooking Exhibition Street. The internal bedroom is separated from the living space by a part glass partition and sliding door. The bathroom is large, but poorly designed with a shower over the bath and no hand towel rack adjacent to the basin. Speaking of design, there was a lot of white noise in our room from the plumbing and ventilation systems in the building. There were the usual niceties including a small breakfast pack, cooking utensils etc. If you like to self-cater, the kitchen would be challenging. However if you like to prepare breakfasts and/or lunches then it is ideal. There is no mini bar, which I find appealing. In this particular apartment the laundry had been removed. This posed no problem for me as my stay was only for two days, however others may expect a laundry and be disappointed. On the plus side there was pay TV and a small stereo. This proved to be a problem for our neighbours who played 'doof doof' music for some time until we complained to reception. The complaint was dealt with quickly and effectively with management reporting back to us what action they had taken and asking us to keep them informed if the situation did not improve. Top marks for this. Room service too was good and prompt. I surmised that the food is pre-prepared and frozen, however it was very tasty and reasonably priced. Our room was serviced, bed made and dishes washed. All of this was good although I felt that the house-keeping was just good enough and that the property did not sparkle. For example there was still construction dust or similar in the kitchen cupboards, windows were not clean, wardrobe door tracks dirty... that sort of thing. The things that matter were clean, but it could be better. In summary, this accomodation is well situated and good value. The staff were all friendly and efficient. I have stayed at numerous other establishments in Melbourne and have no hesitation in saying that this is one of the better ones.
