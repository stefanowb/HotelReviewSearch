This spolit the holiday to a degree. At least I never had too much to drink! Just has well I was cautious of the Turkish men and had been warned. The rooms are okay quite small though the bathrooms are of a reasonable size. Maids do a great job. Pools are nice, we just felt a bit uncomfortable with the bar/waiter staff staring at you. Better to book trips in Turkey as the Reps charge mega prices. Went on a boat trip which cost just \u00a35 with lunch. Drinks are expensive not cheap like they use to be abroad.
