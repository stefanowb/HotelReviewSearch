Then they moved across town from Cortez to LP and we wish we'd stayed where we were. Yes, Cortez is slightly more money, but it is definitely better. All the white in LP feels a bit clinical and the overabundance of questionnaires asking \"How are we doing?\" seems somewhat overwhelming. Situated a minimum 10 minute taxi ride outside of downtown makes commuting a necessary, especially as nearby restaurants are few. Wi-fi is strong. Bathroom & the shower very good. Room cleanliness more than acceptable. Lack of a personal safe in the room is a pain as lodging important items in and out with Reception is a long process. Staff are young but enthusiastic and helpful. Breakfast buffet standard stuff. Watch out for that very strong coffee. Just wish it had all been a bit more natural.
