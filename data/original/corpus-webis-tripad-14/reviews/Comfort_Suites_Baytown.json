Super clean, friendly staff and overall well managed hotel. I like the fact that it is not located right on top of the interstate like many hotels I've stayed. Being a couple of hundred yards away created a quieter experience. I preferred the upper north side which had a nice view of green fields.Very quiet. All of the best restaurants and stores are conviently located. My coworkers also use this same hotel and recommended it to me. It's new, reasonably priced and really nice. Has LCD television, sofa area, refridge and microwave. Easy wireless access at no extra charge. Nice excercise room and the pool is really clean and fairly private. I found the breakfast bar better than average and well attended. The waffle maker is great and the brewed coffee is rich (better than starbucks imho). I've stayed at many hotels in this price range over the past year and this is my favorite. Very nice and highly recommend. Oh yeah, 25 minutes from downtown Houston.", "title": "Excellent choice", "user": "jetzoom99", "date": "July 10, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34365137}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2008, traveled with family", "text": "Security cameras are conviently broken in this high crime area.

The morning clerk could have been a little more friendly although the night clerk was very friendly and sociable.
