This is the first time we have stayed at an all inlcusive hotel and the first time staying on the island. We did stop there on a cruise a few years ago. We were greeted with champagne when we arrived. The room wasn't ready for us because we were so early, so they gave us a pager and we waited in the lobby. It was raining at that point, so the lobby was crowded with all of the hotel and pool guests, but that wasn't problem. We were immediately greeted by another person that informed us of the activities that had been moved insided due to the rain. Within an hour our room was ready. We were upgraded to a larger room due to the volume of people at the hotel. The room was clean and wonderful. The only bad part about that room was the echoing from the hallway. We heard every door slam and every conversation up and down the hall since we were at the end. Bring a sound machine if you are in the hall with the double story rooms. That was the ONLY thing we could find that was a negative about our stay. The whole hotel was nice. The pool was excellent; the location is perfect! The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to downtown and all the shopping. Their version of a Wal-Mart is right across the street in case you need more sunblock, something from the pharmacy, or food, etc. We rented a Jeep from the hotel and took a drive to see the rest of the island on our last full day there. I loved the fact that we didn't have to worry about the water. All the water is purified and food is prepared with this water. That's probably the only reason we have not vacationed in Mexico before; I was concerned about getting sick. No problems here. I would definately stay here and other Palace resorts again after this experience. The staff was very friendly. They bent over backwards to see that we had everything we needed. Our idea of a vacation is being in the sun by the pool and having tropical drinks brought to us all day. That's exactly what we got here. If you want a beach, rent a car and head south and you will discover the most beautiful, white, private beaches on the island. You will be able to snorkel there and at the Chankunaab park. We tried to snorkel in front of the hotel, but it was just too rough for me and not much to see.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "summergirl711", "date": "February 24, 2007", "id": 6835216}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had a great vacation in Cozumel and the Palace was the right place to stay.

We have traveled thru out the caribbean and love the beaches of Aruba and Punta Cana, but did not have the accomodations that the Palace offered. The cleanliness and comfort of the room, the great staff, and the atmosphere of the resort are all reasons to give this a thumbs up. Some people say that since they don't spend their vacation in the room, its not important, but for us it matters. We don't spend a lot of time in the room, but when we are in there we like the comforts of home.

I have to say that I did not like a single fish dish this trip, which I tried at the outside grill, the Italian, and the Mexican restaurant. This is contrary to our other palace resort trips. The other dishes were good to excellent. Finding a shaded spot by the pool was not easy if you arrived mid morning, however, the sand patches on the north and south ends always had some chairs under the straw huts available (but service was a bit lacking on the sand). Finally, being on an island the included tour options were pretty skimpy compared to the mainland, and we could not easily day trip to the other palace resorts.

But the outside grill at lunch looked good - burgers, nachos etc, a better option than the buffett inside if you want to eat by the pool - probably the most spacious area was the outside tables with umbrellas! Seems to me everything was on a smaller, tighter, cramped style than Playacar by far even though they are basically the close in guest occupancy. Drink waitress etc were no where to be found most of the day at the beach areas, so we just went up to the bar ourselves.", "title": "Overall experience was very good", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Sgoudeseun", "date": "February 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6837840, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Rooms and food", "disliked": "\u2014 Compact hotel"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We talked to several staying guests there and they felt the same that the layout of hotel/rooms/bars etc and restaurants were tight on space, a crowded feel.", "title": "Cozumel Palace Feb 15-20", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "IllMarty", "date": "February 25, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 6836494, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly Staff", "disliked": "\u2014 Music"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Our perfect vacation", "text": "Overall, a place to visit for the day or cool off for a few hours, jump off to snorkel - but I wouldn't want to stay here for a extended time, not for the price - when you have other great choices on the mainland and a ferry ride is so easy.", "helpfulness": 16, "user": "a37larry", "date": "February 24, 2007", "id": 6835619}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled solo", "text": "I spent 8 days at CP and loved it.
