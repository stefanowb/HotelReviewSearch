Had a great time. Stayed in the old block which was really nice but bathrooms could do with a refurbishment. The best thing about this resort is definitely the staff. We were treated like kings and queens for the full time we were there. The food in the restaurant was first class where there was something for everyone. Would like to thank Emmad at the quiet pool bar who always greeted us in the morning and also Hamed for making sure our sunbeds were always ready for us. Our waiter in the restaurant was Amr who couldn't do enough to make sure we had everything we needed. At night we normally went into the Waves Bar for a couple of hours and were looked after well by Agmad. We then went down to the Saddle Bar where the karaoke was a great laugh. The resort itself is spotlessly clean due to the hard work of the cleaners and also the gardners. Didn't try the other restaurants as we were only there for a week and were quite happy with the main restaurant. Went to the Bedouin night at the hotel and was very impressed especially with the fire show. All in all this was a fab holiday and we will definitely be back next year.", "title": "FAB HOLIDAY", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "RitaM162", "date": "February 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 125357856}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2012, traveled with family", "text": "The hotel was better than we expected, the location is perefect not to close but still in easyreach of narmma bay and soho sq .the rooms are of a good size the food was of very good quality and the staff well what could we say nothing else but perfect .

Because of the reports that the rooms (especially bathrooms) in the main building are a bit tired, I e-mailed the hotel in advance and requested that my husband & I be allocated a room in the new building, which I am pleased to say was accommodated. We had a lovely spacious room with a huge kingsize bed and a walk-in shower. It was very clean and comfortable, although the bathroom grouting could have done with some bleach to clean it up a bit. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels and a large bottle of water left each day.", "user": "FionaM", "date": "March 8, 2012", "id": 125797497}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Fantastic value for money and the friendliest staff!", "text": "The food is pretty good - I've had better in AI buffet style, but also much worse. Food is always hot enough and you can usually find something you fancy. Breakfast for us was the least good - don't expect a Scottish/English type cooked breakfast. That's fine for us, but I would have liked more choice of cereals and cold meats. You can, though, get freshly cooked omelettes and fried eggs in the BBQ area outside, which is good. Plenty of choice at lunch & dinner and the Egyptian food is pretty good. Choice of 1 soup @ lunchtime and 2 @ dinner, which were always very good and an excellent choice of breads. Only the Pharon buffet restaurant was open, I guess the hotel wasn't busy enough to open the Atrium - it would have been good to have had a choice of buffet restaurant for a change.", "user": "T21AMY", "date": "March 8, 2012", "id": 125783185}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "kiroseiz", "text": "The majority of the staff are great and so helpful (with the exception of one, who I won't name - don't want him to get into trouble). Particular thanks to Azaz and Azr, who looked after us very well. Our only complaint about the restaurant was the wine service - very small glasses and just a dribble at the bottom. We asked for a reasonable glass of wine, but were told that they weren't allowed to do that - it is so stupid, we were constantly trying to attract the waiters' attention to get refills. They work really hard as it is, and this just gives them even more work. I would suggest they either provide better sized glasses (and fill them properly), or provide carafes/half carafes or even self service. We enjoy wine with our meal and this did spoil things somewhat.", "user": "Joanne W", "date": "March 7, 2012", "id": 125772791}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Best holiday in along time", "text": "We went to the Indian restaurant, Bukhara, one night and it was excellent.

Great big parasols, which the pool attendants will help to put up if you're having difficulty. Particular thanks to Emad at the quiet pool/Waves Bar - what a lovely guy, and he made everyone great cocktails. The only annoyance, was as has been said by many reviewers, the constant disruption of people trying to get you to go to the spa/beauty centre. The girl who came round the pools was particularly annoying and would not always take no for an answer.
