We were right beside the Piazza Navona, Antonio (the owner) told us all the good places to eat and we were not dissapointed, Ponte & Parione restorante makes the thinnest pizza and as for their fillet of beef with balsamatic sauce perfection on a plate. this was our second time in Rome this year and when we go back we will definetly not be staying in a 4 star hotel like the first time, instead we will go back to casa di sara or piazza navona b&b.

It is a new residence set in the heart of old Roma. It is in I believe a 15-16th century tower that has quite a bit of character. You will have a slice of Roman life right outside your window that we felt was delightful. The entry into the tower is by steps only, there is no elevator but for ourselves this simply added to the charm. The room was spacious, clean and the service was simple yet adequate. I have stayed at the high end places. If you are looking for 4-5 star service continue on.

He was waiting outside when we arrived and after he checked us in he gave us several tips on how to get around Rome and what to see. There is also a phone there which Antonio told us to use to contact him if we needed to reach him. You do have to climb a few flights of stairs to get to your room and there is no elevator, however, this was not an issue for us. Although the B&B is located steps from Piazza Navona, the room we stayed in was very quiet thanks to the double windows Antonio had installed. The room was large and clean, the bed was comfortable, and there was a tv and a refrigerator. A voucher was included for breakfast (a croissant, juice, and coffee) at a bar across from the tower.
