I can't believe any of the negative reviews. We stayed in a family room with a huge kingsize bed and 2 singles for the kids, there was plenty of space. From the balcony, the view of the ocean was beautiful, we witnessed stunning sunsets. The buffet breakfast was outstanding, the choice was endless, the staff were so helpful and always smiling. The grounds are immaculate with plenty of palm trees which provide ample shade if required.There were always plenty of free sunbeds. The two pools are lovely, the kids pool has a water slide which my kids loved (there was also a life guard overlooking the pool at all times).", "title": "Lovely Hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "JoRig", "date": "June 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68660718}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2010, traveled on business", "text": "The location is very central, the night markets (which are located direcly outside the hotel) are a must, we purchased lots of bargins, wish I had taken an empty suitcase!", "title": "Nice Hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Nora79", "date": "June 23, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 68414582}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled with family", "text": "The food at the hawker marker (a steady 10 min walk from the hotel) was very authentic and delicious ( very reasonable, red snapper and stir fry veg for \u00a32).", "title": "Disappointing, given the price", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ness_st", "date": "June 17, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 67754404}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled with family", "text": "I have read reviews stating the beach infront of the hotel is dirty, I don't agree, yes there are lots of watersports and activities, but we loved the people watching and the atmosphere.

The place was the most welcoming we had stayed at through our trip in Malaysia, and it smelled wonderful as we ventured through the hotel with the essential oils softly burning. We had a sea facing family room. which was perfect for us, roomy enough with everything you need and the bathroom was a good size and stocked with enough towels etc for the four of us, something that was a problem in previous hotels. The maid and house boys were all friendly and often close by if we needed anything (thanks for the cookies and fresh towels....we love you!) The location of the hotel was lovely... I have read complaints about noise from water sports etc, but my husband and I quite enjoyed sitting on the balcony with a drink at the end of the day watching the parasailers drift around.... we loved it!!! There are lots of restaurants close by, and the market stalls open everynight just out the front. The local bus stops just outside too and is very cheap and a good way to get around... we caught it a few times to go to the big shopping malls and cinemas. The children aged 7 & 9 enjoyed the kids club and the pool area and chatting and playing with the lifeguards who are all very friendly and eager to help. I felt like there was everything we needed to all have the best trip ever... my husband and I were able to have time together and dinner alone thanks to the kids club and we were able to enjoy ourselves as a family too with everything being offered at our door step.... We were truly able to unwind!!!!
