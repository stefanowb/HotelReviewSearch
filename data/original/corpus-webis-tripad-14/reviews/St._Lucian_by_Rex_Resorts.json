All in all a great holiday in a beautiful spot right on the beach. My only disappointment was the town itself, Rodney Bay, which had been built purely for tourists and consisted of a small american style shopping mall, very little local flavour at all.

We normally get bored of the all inclusive food after a few days but the varied menu meant this was not the case. The main pool is really nice, cleaned daily and located just a few feet from the beach which is excellent. The sea was quite rough on some days but that just made the body boarding more fun the rest of the time it was great for swimming and snorkelling. The water sports were good the price was very reasonable and negotiable. We had a lesson on the hoby sail boat which only cost 25 US dollars after this we were able to take it out whenever we wanted as part of our all inclusive package. We met some great people many who go back year after year which says something. Our flight home was delayed for 4 days due to snow and the hotel again were really helpful. They let us stay in the same room for this period which meant we were able to enjoy an extended stay without disruption.

A note was posted in the bathroom that there was a shortage of water due to the tropical storm. You would only get water from 9-6, so of course there was not hot water only lukewarm. Sometimes the water would be brown. The only good thing about the room was the ocean view. The beach was only 10 ft from the balcony. The beach was beautiful but the waves were rough. You have to be careful swiming in the ocean because there is no liefguard there. The hotel was empty so we have the beach to ourselves and it was very relaxing for us. The pool was dirty with sand, not worth swiming in it. Only 1 restaurant was opened, we had breakfast and went to get an omlete by the kitchen area. They cooked your eggs on a regular stove which was black, the coil around the opening was full of dust. The waitstaff was not friendly at all except for the bartender Harry. He served with smiles.I would recommend that you have your meals outside of this hotel. There is a shopping mall, a supermarket and several restaurants within 10 minutes walking. We had dinner at the Delirous Restaurnt. My husband had grilled chicken and I had Mahi Mahi, it was very good. Overall, I got a cheap deal for the room and the flight so it is what I paid.
