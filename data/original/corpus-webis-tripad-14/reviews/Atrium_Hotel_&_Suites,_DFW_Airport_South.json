For instance, our room was a two room suite with a large, fully furnished sitting/living area upon initial entry. The bedroom was very large as well, much larger than newer hotels. Each room was equipped with a flat screen TV; there was also a small frig, microwave and coffee pot. Unfortunately the Radisson 'dial-a-bed' has never been my favorite for comfort but was acceptable. We attended a seminar here and the hotel catered the meals which were surprisingly good. The hotel lobby area is huge, the first floor actually. It has an odd but functional layout. Our requests for help from the staff were promptly attended. Our meeting area was adequate and the hotel offers van service to the airport and local mall. We received a very competitive internet room rate.
