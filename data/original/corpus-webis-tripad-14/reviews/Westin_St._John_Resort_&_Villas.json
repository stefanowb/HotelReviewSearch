It includes unlimited trips to St. Thomas, so if you want to shop or golf one day, it is worth it. If you have a very early departure out of STT, absolutely do it as they will get you a private water taxi if needed to get you there in time. On the downside, you will lose about 2 hours on your day of arrival waiting for their boat, but during that time you can shop and eat at a pretty fun bar right by where you get picked up. Doing it on your own is cheaper and faster, but you are on your own. \"Taxi\" service isn't a private car like at home. It is a big open pickup with seats and it costs extra if you want them to leave right when you get in.

The resort location is so unfortunate as it is on a man-made beach with terrible sand next to a working marina. To stay on the beach for any part of the day would be a waste of time as there are much better beach options anywhere else on the island. Based on other reviews, many found the Westin grounds to be spectacular. I was sorely disappointed in how ordinary their grounds are. Try visiting Caneel Bay and you will be duly impressed by their expansive gardens, grounds and beaches. If you want luxury, class and comfort, and if you can't find anything other than rack rate at the Westin, head straight to Caneel Bay where we stayed a couple of years back and found it to be head and shoulders above the Westin.

Yes, it does have plastic furniture and yes it is hot, but just about everywhere is hot, including the resort's flagship restaurant--Chloe and Bernard's. Make sure you get the fresh lobster at the Lime Inn. Also, make sure you eat at Uncle Joe's barbecue. Let me warn you, though. This place, like the best barbecue places on the U.S. mainland, is a hole. The food is excellent, though, and we spent less than $30 for two of us.

We chartered a twin-hulled powerboat with two 250 HP 4-stroke engines for a full day, with a captain to act as a tour guide and to take care of everything. We had Nate, and he took great care of us. He let us tell him what we wanted out of the day trip and he recommended the best spots. We visited Leinster Bay, where we snorkeled for a half-hour. Then we went to Jost Van Dyke, BVI and then went to the Soggy Dollar Bar, where the \"Painkiller\" was invented. After that we went to the Caves on Norman Island for more snorkling and then it was lunch time. We at at Willy T's, a \"pirate ship\" anchored in one of the bays. It was one-half bar, one-half restaurant. The food was great and quite reasonable. After eating we went to the \"Indians\" for more snorkling and then headed back, arriving back at the Westin at 4:30. This was by far our best day of the trip. It was very expensive, especially since it was just my wife and myself carrying the full cost, but we figured we spent $5k on the trip so far, and what's another $700 for a dream date.

A few observations- you can check in for the resort right at the airport (+) and even book transportation to the hotel from the airport at the same time (+). Hotel shuttle/water taxi is very efficient however also in my opinion, expensive. Hotel grounds are very well maintained. Beach outside of hotel is nice as well. Pool had some cracks- looked a bit old and in need of freshening up. Our room was a standard room in the middle of the resort complex. Room had seen better days. Lamp didn't work; bathroom water would mysterious turn extremely hot or extremely cold. Sheets had what looked to be burn marks on them. Around the resort, it looked like the roof needed replacing. The resort is huge. It takes some time to walk from one spot to another. You can walk into Cruz Bay from the hotel, but be prepared to avoid traffic ... also there is a large hill. Food at hotel is expensive. Free coffee in the morning up until a certain time. After that, the coffee is $8? There is a grocery store near by. I suggest stocking up there for snacks and sodas. Hotel rooms have fridge. Ours did not keep things cold. One highlight- resort feeds iguanas daily. Truly something to see. Also, staff EXTREMELY friendly.

Most of our days consisted of going to a beach for a few hours then returning to the Westin. We went to Caneel, Cinammon, Trunk Bay, and Maho. We ate lunches at the pool. My kids loved the pool. It was never really overly crowded, but did have a little trouble finding a chairs. (It would be nice if they had more.) I had read bad reviews about the beach. It really was fine except my kids hated all the seaweed. Once they got past the seaweed, they loved the inflatable rock climb and trampoline in the water. We went out to dinner each night.

There was only one person at the front desk and one person in line in front of me and I waited for almost thirty minutes to get checked in. As a platinum member, the person at the front desk told me that she had a really nice upgrade for me. We got to the room and found a 6x3 (foot) puddle waiting for us on the carpet that ran from the back door to the edge of the bed.

I went to the front desk, I was told that they would have this cleaned. Several hours later, this hadn\u2019t been done and they finally offered another room, but by this time it was after ten p.m. and I was exhausted from the trip and just decided to wait until the morning. The next morning when I went to look at my new room, I found it already occupied. The only other room they had available was on the ground floor, which if it rained may allow water into the room. Our so-called upgrade was a room with a view of the tennis courts in the front and some tree\u2019s in the back. The room itself was in need of a fresh coat of paint and a deep cleaning.

Our ages range from 55 to 17. Even with the wide variety of ages and interests, every one of us had a great vacation. Of the many, many highlights, the Cabanas were amazing. We rented the cabanas for 2.5 days of our 6 day stay and they added an extra level of relaxation and enjoyment on top of the already great atmosphere at the Westin St. John. We utilized the spa - which was wonderful. Amanda and Emily worked with us and provided wonderful massages. David helped us out with some additional amenities in one of our rooms - he was 'Johnny on the spot'. Brittany and many others on the activities staff checked with our group frequently to ensure we had what we needed to enjoy ourselves. She did a great job and helped make our stay a tremendous success. The rooms were older, but well maintained, clean and appropriate to the minimal amount of time we spent sleeping in them. The location is unbelievably beautiful - from the entrance to the bay to the palm covered hills rising behind the resort. We did some research prior to arriving and scheduled activities ranging from a scuba 'orientation' dive to parasailing to a cruise to some of the nearby British Virgin Islands. We didn't think of it in advance, but while there, we rented cars to tour the island and check out many of the beaches. If you want to do this, get your car in advance because we had a hard time finding rental cars available on short notice. We quickly discovered that taxis (converted pick-up trucks) will take you almost anywhere on the island for $5 to $25 a person. Our cruise to the British VI was tremendous. If you come to Cruz Bay, you've got to see the 'Baths'. Our boat Captain, Justin and the First Mate, Carrie really made our trip enjoyable and since we were essentially a 'private' charter (we had the boat to ourselves) remained flexible with the schedule. The highlight was definately the 'Baths' though. We could have stayed there all day, but Justin and Carrie correctly advised us to see some other sights, snorkle and do some beachcombing as well. The only negative we can think back to was the rudeness of Kevin, who works in the Cruz Bay Watersports shop.

Once you have your luggage, you leave it at the Westin airport desk and, the next time you see it, it's in your room. Pack a bathing suit in a knapsack or some carry-on, as the luggage is generally off-loaded from the ferry about 1/2 hour after the passengers. The St. Thomas airport is not air-conditioned, so, while small, the Westin airport lounge has A/C and is comfortable. If it's going to be awhile until the next ferry, they'll bring you over to the dock, where there's a restaurant to grab a bite or drink. Adjacent to the dock restaurant is the last true grocery store you'll see for the remainder of your trip, so I would definitely suggest checking it out to pick up any items you can fit in your carry-on.

The taxis are generally open-air pick-up truck customizations, with three or four rows. The drivers may try to wait around for some additional paying customers once you're on the taxi. If you wait more than a few minutes, insist that they just take whoever's in the taxi right then. We had to do this once or twice when returning from one of the beaches. * The Westin deli (Mango Deli), which is near the gym, is good for coffee, bagels, and danishes. It also has beer and wine for sale. The beer prices were OK, the wine prices were high. For wine, I would recommend the grocery store I previously mentioned on the St. Thomas dock.

The previous 3 times we had a great experience, however we were so dissappointed because this past time was awful! Their management must be changing over, because we encountered WAY too many problems in the 5 days we were there. Since there were 8 of us traveling, we had 4 separate rooms. Each room had huge bleach stains all over the carpet. There were cockroaches in my parent's room, and also in the room of a couple staying a few doors down from me. There were also cockroaches crawling all over the beach bar, absolutely disgusting!!! Our minibar was full of half-eaten food leftover from the previous guest. We did not receive towels, washclothes, or maid service on a daily basis, and when we called to request these things, waited approx. an hour for someone to come (the resort is not that big - it should NOT take nearly that long). At breakfast one morning at the beach cafe, my fiance ordered eggs, which came out completely raw and cold. THe food and service is terrible - we waited an average of 30-45 minutes just to get our order taken every time we ate at the beach cafe. My parents had a big carpet nail sticking out of the carpet in their room, which my mother stepped on, puncturing her foot. The bartenders, waitresses, and other staff were extremely rude and had a lot of attitude, not what you want to deal with on vacation! When we complained to the management about all the problems, they responded with shrugs and blank stares. We will not be returning to the Westin next year.
