Internet access was provided for those that can't unplug (or just want to check the weather). My wife & I stayed one night in Nikko - which was sufficient during late winter/spring conditions. We didn't get a meal at the Hotel but maybe should have, since we stayed in Nikko on a Thursday on March 31st and all the restaurants seemed to be closed except for the Asian Garden by the Train Station (a bus ride away). The hotel, located adjacent the Daiyagawa river is walking distance to the major shrines. Across a bridge past the Turtle Inn Annex is a park with approximately 100 stone Buddhas (each with red cap). Our room cost was 9,000 Yen for one night, the room had a sink, and use of shared bathrooms.

For the price, it's one of the best accommodation bargains we've seen in Japan. For less than 10,000 yen per night, we had a small but clean room with en suite Western bath and two very comfortable Western beds, plus unlimited use of the inn's hot baths. While not a true onsen (natural hot springs inn), the Turtle pipes its hot bath water directly from a natural hot spring just upstream of the inn. It has two baths, one perfect for two, and another just right for solo soaking. As we were there in December, just after the Fall color tourist season, we had the place almost to ourselves. The friendly proprietors speak English and will provide reasonably priced breakfast (fresh fruit, juice, eggs, breads) and dinner (trout and sukiyaki) if you order them the day before. Nikko has some of the most visually spectacular temples and shrines within an easy walk of the inn. A 5- minute walk will take you to the stop for frequent bus service to the JR station and nearby Lake Chuzenji and Kegon waterfall. The Inn offers both Western and Japanese-style rooms. While the Turtle Inn is not a luxury accommodation, it is convenient, clean, comfortable and a real bargain in a beautiful town.", "title": "Dreadful room", "user": "ftys", "date": "November 18, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 6148049, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 checking out", "disliked": "\u2014 everything"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2006", "text": "It rains a lot in Nikko - we slept with the window open in the cold November night air because the damp and mildew smell was overpowering.
