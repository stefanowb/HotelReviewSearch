The hotel is modern and located in what was formerly East Berlin, so the surrounding area still bears some of the effects of many years of communist control. In the past few years, however, the area has undergone extensive development in certain areas. The hotel is convenient to the Friedrichstrasse shopping district and some other Berlin sites, such as Checkpoint Charlie. The hotel itself is attractive, the rooms are of ample size, clean, modern and comfortable. The restaurant offers good food.
