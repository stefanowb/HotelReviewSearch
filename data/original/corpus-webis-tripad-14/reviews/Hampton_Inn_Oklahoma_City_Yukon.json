It seems as if they remodeled the rooms on the cheap and completely forgot to remodel the hallways. Our room was dank and a roach on the ceiling greeted me upon entry. This hotel was too cheap to include a desk chair so you must sit on an ottoman that is much too low to the ground. The carpet on the far end of the room looks as if it hasn't been vacuumed since the remodel and the room smelled like a dank movie theatre. Bathrooms are tiny compared to other Hamptons. The Homewood suites down the road is nicer and a much better value, we paid 6 dollars more to stay there. I've definitely been in worse but with a lot of other options around I will not return to this hotel and would suggest for others to stay elsewhere.", "title": "Stay elsewhere", "user": "jjohncar", "date": "May 29, 2010", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "service": 2.0}, "id": 65760065}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We really liked our room, which appeared to be recently updated.

I asked at the front desk and they did manage to find a copy of the Oklahoma City daily for me. Comforters were overwashed/worn out - had become lumpy (the covers were new, clean and nice). As another review mentioned, the footstool (not a work chair) at the room desk is weird/awkward. Would not have wanted to stay here on biz and need to compute or write a lot. The Zenith 27\" tube TV looked really out of place in a nicely upscale/updated room. Likewise, the shower enclosure looked like a do it yourself kit from Home Depot - as compared to the granite sink counter. Sort of funny cheap/expensive mix of room features.

My husband had made an error in reserving our rooms in Bricktown, so we had our kids to stay there and we had to speedily find a room for the night. Bricktown was simply packed with people and there were no other rooms at any of the other hotels in Bricktown!!! I had seen the Hampton Inn in Yukon before and some of our extended family stayed there. So, we took a chance. It is clean, the beds are really comfortable, the rooms are designed nicely, it is quiet, and the price is good. So, it \"saved the day,\" for us that weekend!! Loved it and felt that with another New Year's celebration, then we should all stay there, instead of fighting all of the traffic in Bricktown. The staff at the front desk were very nice and they had snacks on hand that evening that were free and they have an excellent continental breakfast. Everything was clean and nice.
