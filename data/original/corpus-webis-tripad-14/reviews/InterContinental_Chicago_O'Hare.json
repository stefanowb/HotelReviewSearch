I was excited at check-in the painting at the front desk just looked relaxing. I went to the conference reception dinner - food was great. I went back to my room to relax & read. Because I\"m a bit neurotic I always check the bed for bed bugs. I just DETEST insects so it's something I always do. I tore the bed apart (as I always do) and felt satisfied all was good. I snuggled into the very very comfy bed with my book. I fell asleep reading & around 1:30AM woke up. I got a drink of water & came back to bed to find a bug on my pillow. At first I thought it was just a small cockroach - gross, but no big deal. Then I put my glasses back on & realized it was a bed bug. I caught in in tisssue & killed it. I left in the bathroom sink for the manager to look at. I called down to the front desk & the sent someone up right away. He took the bug away & I said I needed to move - he said he see what he could do. The overnight manager & the assistant manager both showed up at my room not 10 minutes later - the assistant manager confirmed it was a bed bug. They both apologized profusely. They helped me move all my things out, put me 5 floors away in a suite, helped me check out my luggage in the new room. They called twice more that night to check on me. They comped me internet/movies & breakfast. The day manager called later to tell me they already had a company that specializes in bed bug extermination in the room fixing the problem. She also said there had been a large international conference the week before & that room had an individual from over-seas in it. I was still too freaked to sleep in the new bed in the new room (cuz I'm a bug phobe) and just slept on top with the washable throw blanket. Luckily the suite bathrooms are huge (and awesome!) so I kept all my luggage in the bathroom on hard surfaces. They did everything they could to make up for the issue. I was not bitten & we only saw two bugs total in the room. The mattress was clean other wise as were the feather bed & comforter. So, it was probably a very very isolated incident. However, thought I would put it out there for the \"good of the order.\" Stellar customer service during the whole issue by everyone involved.", "title": "Beautiful until the Bed Bug appeared - management quick to help though", "user": "TBGH99", "date": "October 5, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 45935555}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed for just one night and a one day meeting.

But not an easy location if you want to visit downtown. Even if you are just staying at this hotel because you are visiting the city, traveling to/from isn\u2019t that awkward \u2013 but, it will take 30-60 minutes to get downtown. Service is incredible. Food is OK -- better than average hotel food, but still a bit boring for vegetarians. Nearby restaurants are meat-heavy. I did appreciate the care they gave to keeping room-service food hot and presentable. Appointments in the hotel are beautiful, clean, comfortable, and imaginative. Some failures in the small details (i.e. beautiful pieces in the bathroom, but failure to put a collar over the pipes). Fortunate enough to have a view from my room that overlooked a forest preserve, across from which you can see the city skyline. Ask for a room that faces that skyline.

The free shuttle comes by the shuttle area of the airport every 20 minutes. The hotel is new--about 9 months old from what I heard--and very modern. Spa-like colors--dark an earthy--predominate, and all areas of the hotel that I was in are squeaky clean. My large junior suite had a comfie king-size bed with 5 feather pillows, 4 reading reading lights, and an alarm clock which I had no idea how to use but which apparently works with an iPod. You do have to hunt for the coffee pot--in the cabinet under the tv on a pull-out tray. There's an in-room safe, too. There was a sitting area but it was not particularly cozy due to the very spare, angular design of the furniture. The color scheme was quite dark, and even with all the lights on, the dark furnishings and walls sucked up the light. I suppose some find that soothing and spa-like, but I prefer light and airy myself. The bathroom was large with lots of chrome and glass. The huge glass shower has a single large showerhead of the \"rain shower\" type. In discussing the rooms with colleagues, we panned the shower--there's a reason most showerheads come out of the wall at an angle and it has to do with basic anatomy. Also, many of us struggled with the bathroom faucet, unable to figure out how to turn it on. One woman struggled for 10 minutes and was on the verge of calling the front desk but turned it one by accident. I played around with it for about 5 minutes and I too, nearly called the front desk. The trick is to pull just the handle, not the whole knob, towards you. Sounds simple, right? Ha! The art work throughout the hotel was pretty amazing and mostly showcased modern artists' work--some lesser known and some whose names you'll recognize. The meetings rooms were perfect--check out the giant rose-petal lights in the ceilings! The staff was spectacular--housekeeping, room service, food servers at the meeting, front-desk, even shuttle drivers. They were friendly, helpful, easy to find, and smart. The management of the hotel clearly \"gets\" that customer service is key to a happy guest who will return again and recommend the hotel to others. The hotel gave us a really good deal for our meeting--rooms were areound $130/night, which is a steal considering how nice the place is. There's a McCormick & Schmicks a few steps from the hotel--a restaurant which I always enjoy though I didn't get a chance to go to this one. The food I tried from a rather limited room service menu as well as the food that the hotel prepared for the meeting was rather bland, with too-large servings of pasta and poor presentation. They definitely need to upgrade the chef's skills, recipes, and presentation--it's not difficult or expensive to do an eye-catching presentation. The exceptions to the so-so food were a lovely cream of asparagus soup and a flourless chocolate cake. The light techo music that plays throughout the hotel was a bit annoying, though at least it wasn't loud. Younger people might find appealing. I could even hear it in the meetings rooms when the doors were open. Overall, I found the hotel to be a real bargain and an excellent choice for a centrally located meeting involving national clients who are flying in from all over the states, like ours. It was roundly applauded by our clients, who usually have to leave our conferences early to get flights at reasonable times, but with it's proximity to the airport, only a few people had to leave before the meeting finished. BTW, I could sometimes hear jets flying over from the lobby, but not from any other part of the hotel. None of the clients complained about airport noise, so they seemed to have sound-proofed the hotel extremely well.
