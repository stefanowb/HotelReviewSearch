The beginning of the stay was bumpy: I'd reserved a non-smoking room and called 10 days in advance to confirm all details. The nice lady even said they'd have room made up early for us b/c our flight arrived so early (6:30 am, putting us at hotel around 9:30am). When we arrived, the room was not to be ready until 2pm, normal check-in time. We did the jet-lag-walk-around and I rested in lobby until room was ready. Unfortunately, the room was a smoking room. The smell was intense and the product used to mask the smell almost as bad. After being told we could not switch rooms, we moved to a much nicer room. It was huge (for Paris) and faced a quiet side (we gave up a modest view of Madeleine church that we had from smoking room). The bathroom was very nice and big. Despite not getting much direct sun, the room was fairly light because of its large floor-to-ceiling windows that open. Coffee pot in room and we used mini fridge for our own goodies. Grocery store close by. Easy walk to Louvre, Metro, Concorde, Orsay and much more. The bed was hard, but that seems to be the way of Europe. Towel warmer in bathroom was nice touch and helpful for the little sink laundry we did. The shopping is very expensive in the area - lots of luxury chains. Myriad cafes in the area - tho those near hotel are way overpriced, beware.

It was mine and my boyfriends first holiday together, and couldn't of been happier with our choice of hotel. We stayed in the V.I.P. suite and highly reccommend it to other travellers, it exceeded our expectations in size with a toilet and en-suite separate. Maid service was brilliant they came and tidied not only the routine once a day but every time we left (which we really appreciated as we managed to leave it in a tip!) The staff are really helpful and friendly, they reccommended good restaurants (we ate at the italian across the road, which was gorgeous!) also bars and clubs in the area.Unfortunantly we didn't take their advice on which clubs to go to and ended up going out near the arc de triomphe which is unbelievably expensive !! (as students we were shocked when we had to pay 40 euros for a vodka orange and beer!!) The staff also sorted out taxis for us but make sure you go down on time and don't wait until they call your room as taxis will start charging straight away as we normally were already on 10 euros when we got in.The hotel is in an ideal location for anyone who wants to go to Paris for sightseeing or shopping as we walked down to the champs elysees in 10 minutes, which is beautiful. As a young couple on our first holiday it was a perfect choice of location and we really enjoyed our stay and would go back.
