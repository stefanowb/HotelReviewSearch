'05 and we had some pretty bad experiences. We arrived to the hotel at 3am after a night out and all of our key cards were cancelled and when we went to the desk we were treated as if we were criminals. Ultimately they figured out that when we checked in that the desk staff had entered the wrong check-out date and it was their mistake. We had to wait until after 5:30 am for them to figure this out. The general manager said that we should have been allowed to enter our room and that it should have been taken care of during the day. The NAZI desk staff would not budge as we were foreigners. I live in JAPAN and speak Japanese so I was following the conversations. It would have been handled differently had the guests been Japanese. This is the down side of being a foreigner in Japan sometimes but I would have expected more from the WESTIN HOTEL. We lost a day of our trip to TOKYO because of this. We splept through a tour we had planned and we were unable to re-book it. We were given many \"sorry's\" and many deep bows and were given one night for free but it soured our hotel experience. Tokyo was AWESOME so I suggest you look for another hotel to fully appreciate this GREAT city!! The desk supervisor arranged reservations for my two friends in the TEPPAN YAKI STEAK HOUSE on the 22nd floor for their last night in TOKYO and when they arrived they had to wait 20 minutes to be told that it would have to take 1 MORE HOUR for them to get a table because they lost the reservation!! What kind of service is that? They offered to send them out of the hotel to another place but they waited and when they got the check they were charged a table charge and my friend refused to pay it. The next morning I had to call the hotel's general manager and the general manager in the KYOTO WESTIN who will be the new GM in TOKYO soon to get that dinner taken off of their total bill. That meal should have been complimentary to begin with. This would most likely not happen in other credible 5-star hotels. There are better hotels closer to the action than the WESTIN. KEEP SEARCHING! By the way, we were allowed to eat the lunch buffet as a result of us sleeping through breakfast the day we were locked out and the food was terrible. The breakfast was never great either. The executive room on the 17th floor was fairly crowded and tables were often full of dirty dishes and guests had to stand around to wait for tables to be cleared. After the one free night and free dinner it was not worth 370,000 yen for 6 nights!
