The hotel is in the Rocks area, sandwiched between two streets, which makes it SUPER QUIET. It is hard to find, as the back entrance is off Harrington street. Full laundry, dishwasher, oven, microwave, fridge, yet maid service, mini bar, etc. Everything anyone needs is at this hotel, including room service. Why eat in the room, though? We brought water, soda, Arnott's cookies , etc to the room and really had peace and quiet. The views were amazing as well. Not once did we hear other people. There are very few rooms on the floors. The residents live in the high floors. We loved this place. My biggest complaint, however, is they changed the rates on us after we booked the place. I really had to argue with them about this. I suggest getting your rates PER NIGHT in writing 100%. They upped our rates on various nights by $69 AUD. I had to speak to the manager, as I felt scammed. They ended up finally just increasing it by $19 on various nights. How can a place get away with this? We were told our rate was $159 per night for 7 nights. When we checked out, some of the nights were $180, $205, $169.. very strange--WHAT A SCAM, and WHAT UTTER BS. Other than this, we loved the staff, the hotel, the convenience of being so close to everything, yet blocks away from the noise. We would return here, but would simply request the nightly rate--BY DATE-- in writing. The hotel does not have the service of Shangri La, but feels more like \"home\" to people. LCD TVs in the living room, bedroom also, nice bathroom, Bliss shower products, dish soap, laundry soap. Doing laundry while traveling is a nice convenience and this alone makes this place worth staying. Even if there is noise, which we did not hear, you can turn up the air such that it is loud. DSL, etc for a price, pay per view, etc. Staff was really nice here also. Did not care for the changing rates.. I am really not sure how the hotel can get away with this when they do not appear to disclose this with guests--they maybe forgot to do this with just us?

When orders come, they arrive with mistakes, and the standard of the cuisine is mediocre (though why you would want to eat in-doors being so central is another matter). Serious room faults were repeatedly reported, but never acted upon by front desk staff; the severity of the problem was only acknowledged when we were checked out by a more senior member of staff. The promise of a suite upgrade on a future visit however, is somewhat wanting. During our stay, the swimming pool, spa and gym facilities were being upgraded, though check-in staff neglected to in form us of this...would anyone have checked into a 5 star hotel knowing this?
