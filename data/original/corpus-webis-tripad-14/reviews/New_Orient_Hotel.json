The service was great, breakfast was really nice, worth the 9 euros and the lady's serving it were lovely. The hotel was in the centre of Paris but a bit out of the middle.

We couldn't put our suitcases anywhere except down the side of the bed but we made it work. We also did get the smallest room so you get what you pay for!
