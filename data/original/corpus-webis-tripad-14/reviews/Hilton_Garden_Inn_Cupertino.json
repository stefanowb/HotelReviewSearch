You select your cooked-to-order omelette as part of your buffet, but the server will bring it to you hot (as opposed to you standing in a line waiting) from the kitchen while you accessorize your entree from the self-serve fruit, potatoes, and meat platters. They also have this Japanese breakfast consisting of grilled salmon, miso soup, scrambled eggs, and steamed rice, served in a little bento box--delicious. Can't say I've seen that offered at any other HGI. I must not forget Rose, our incredible server who has been at this location since it opened. I'm sure her legendary reputation (see previous reviews) needs no additional accolades--lets hope management can prevent her from retiring (read--more money).", "title": "Pretty good hotel, too expensive", "user": "salsanacho", "date": "July 20, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8207740}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2007", "text": "In summary, great room, great food, great staff, great weekend rates, and great location.
