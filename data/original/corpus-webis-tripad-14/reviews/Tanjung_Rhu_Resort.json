As everyone has said the staff are AMAZING!! I really didnt expect them to have such a huge impact on the enjoyment of our stay, we loved seeing Akil in the evening for dinner and the Azahari at reception was always so bubbly, the food and drinks were AWESOME!!! every meal we ate over the course of our stay was divine! We couldn't get enough of the mocktails and tried every one and some 3 or 4 times over :) The chocolates on the pillow at night were always nice to come back to, the sunsets are gorgeous!, the pools are beautiful, did I mention the food, OMG the food!!!!! Try the sweet chilli, mango and prawn/shrimp salad, or the mudcake...or well everything!!! Akil's banana flambe is delicious as well. We spent our evenings in the \"reading room\" relaxing, surfing the net a little to boast to friends how much we were enjoying ourselves, the spa and massages are fantastic as well.....just watch the sun even when you are in the shade, living in QLD Aus I am very careful to use sunscreen but was unaware that you can even get burnt in the shade in Langkawi, we were lucky to have great weather also. One thing you must do is go \"all inclusive\" if you had to pay for meals and drinks you really couldnt enjoy the full experience without having to constantly think about how much you were spending, the food and beverage prices are on par with expensive hotels.
