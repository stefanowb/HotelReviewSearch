The front desk clerk we saw each evening was friendly and quite efficient. The hotel was very flexible about providing transportation to our work location and to a local mall. An added bonus, since we did not rent a car, was that there are several adequate restaurants within walking distance. The accommodations are pretty utilitarian, but the hotel does provide free wireless Internet service. All told, the Country Inn in Mount Prospect is a decent place to stay if you have business in the area.", "title": "A Safe Bet in the Chicago Suburbs", "user": "joeb1249", "date": "June 13, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 16893837, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The efficient staff", "disliked": "\u2014 The rooms are predictably dreary"}}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Mount Prospect"}, "stars": 2.5, "variance": {"poor": 12, "average": 18, "very good": 40, "terrible": 10, "excellent": 60}, "aka": "Country Inn And Suites Chicago o`Hare Nw", "slim_ranking": 0.75}
