However it was a very different experience. Firstly we were asked were we on a 'Groupon deal' which we werent but surely they dont need to ask this first thing- does it really matter or is service different??We asked for no butter on sandwiches which was fine. The tea arrived extremely quickly which we were surprised about but we could see why. The sandwiches were so poor and bland- a slice of beef no relish etc in between 2 slice of bread and same with slice of ham, and a slice of turkey- the egg mayo was nice though! Next tier- the scones were awful- one was so hard we could hardly cut it so i went looking for a staff member- i walked round the kells bar, the whole lobby area, the reception the setanta restaurant and no one was around so i ended up in the gift shop where the girl said she would sort it for me. A new scone arrived that was so hot u couldnt touch it and then went soggy because of the heating in a microwave. The mini desserts were not nice the cheesecake had a soggy bottom. It was fairly obvious all the tiers are done and ready to go and just dished out. We spoke to a lovely waitress (who hadnt served us because our waiter never came back) who was very nice and didn't charge us. I am generally a big fan of this hotel and got married here too but was feeling very disappointed and im Not sure if i would return for the afternoon tea.", "title": "Relaxing and Enjoyable Stay", "user": "FoxJ13", "date": "November 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 185060585}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2013, traveled with family", "text": "Enjoyed one night here in a large family room with my wife and two children, this was for a family gathering. The hotel was very busy throughout the weekend and is popular with weddings and functions. The reception staff were friendly and efficient on arrival although on leaving there was some bill confusion and the wrong invoice presented twice. The function I attended had a hot buffet and its own room both were excellent and the service organised and fast. The service at the bar was very quick given how busy the hotel was. The health club pool was enjoyed by the four of us on the afternoon before our do, we timed it just right and it wasn't too crowded although others found it too busy. The breakfast choice was excellent and the quality good. The hotel grounds are lovely for a walk, the hotel itself is well maintained with plenty of areas to meet and enjoy a chat and a drink. Despite being so busy the functions were very well contained in terms of noise no disturbance to the bedrooms and very little guest noise in the corridors.
