However, the room was clean and we were provided with plenty of towels etc. We did have to deal with cigarette smoke each morning and evening as came under the door and through the vents from the ajoining unit. We had to stuff towels under the door and kept the sliding door open to deal with the smell. We knew we would not have laundry facilities in our villa as it was only 1br, but didn't realize that their would only be one coin operated washer and dryer for the whole building. This made laundy a hassel, and when asked the front desk told us the closes wash dry and fold service laundramat was 15 or more miles away. The pool was nice and never crowded and the onsite mini-mart was great, not too overpriced.
