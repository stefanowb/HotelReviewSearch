My family and I enjoyed our 2 night stay there very much.

I would not recommend eating at the restaurant as the food looks really boring and out of a can. The other 2 motels in the area aren't much better. We ended up eating at the local Burger King and A & W. Pretty bad stuff but at least you know what you're getting. If your expectations are reasonable then you'll enjoy the Thunderbird Inn. One final note: I wouldn't arrange a tour of the canyon with the motel.

There were absolutely NO parking spaces - we were lucky to snag the one parking place we did! We asked about parking when checking in and were told that there was no special parking for hotel guests, it was a free-for-all for anyone who wanted to park there. We had to schlep all of our luggage about 1/4 mile up and down stairs (no elevators) - it seems that they could at least have some of the parking spaces around the lodges designated for guests - afterall you pay about $120 per night per room.
