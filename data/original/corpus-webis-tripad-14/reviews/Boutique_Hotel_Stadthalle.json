The hotel provides a hearty and delicious breakfast buffet with plenty of cold and hot food options (as well as sufficient options for vegetarians). Our room (double room) was very spacious with a comfortable full-sized bed. The room was warm, inviting and cozy with the proper heating needed as Vienna gets very cold in this time of year. The room was always kept clean with daily housekeeping and fresh towels at your request. Everything in the hotel room worked. It had a modern shower and toilet which some guests might find to be on the small side but remember you are not going to spend all your time there in the duration of your stay. The hotel offered free wi-fi/internet access in the rooms which worked well most of the time (ask for a password/access code at reception).

The environmental twist on the hotel is refreshing with ecofriendly touches throughout. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful with plenty of organic options following the ecofriendly theme.The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from one of the main train/underground stations making the city really accessible and easy to explore. There are a few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel if you dont want to always venture into the city centre. There is a small supermarket opposite which is very handy for the odd refreshments that you need. This is the perfect base for a relaxing stay in a wonderful city, the New Years celebrations in Vienna are fantastic and definately recommended for both friends, couples and families. We would definately revisit the Boutiquehotel Stadthalle on a return visit to Vienna. Note, the hotel does advertise a 10% discount on the total room rate for those travelling by train, however this only applies to people who would normally drive and not if you have flown in and travelled from the airport by train, this could be explained better.
