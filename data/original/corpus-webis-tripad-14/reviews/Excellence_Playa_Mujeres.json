It is every bit as beautiful as the pics on their website. the accomodations were perhaps the best we've ever had. We chose the swim out unit at the pool (1st floor ) and couldnt have been happier. We stayed in the 8000 building and were close to everything. The resort is spread out a bit but easy to navigate. The staff was very friendly and eager to accomodate all of your wants. Of the 7 restaurants available, we ate at the Lobster house, the french, italian, and asian restaurants. For us, the food was outstanding, but we are not picky eaters. The buffet breakfast in the Barcelona restaurant was the largest we had ever seen, and you could get eggs, omellets, etc cooked to order. Not all of the restaurants are open every nite, but there is a posting provided when maid service comes in to turn down your bed in the evening. Drinks are plentiful and you can get any brand you want, just ask. There is nitely entertainment in the open theatre and it ranges from pretty good to extremely good. There is not a whole lot of nitelife, but the lounge is open for dancing from 11 to 1 am. On our last nite there, we shared a teppinyaki table in the Spice restaurant with 2 wonderful couples both on their honemoon. Thanks to Brinn and Hanna from Liverpool in the UK and Eric and Andrea from Alabama for making the nite a blast !!! Especially the dancing in the Alegra lounge afterwards.

I'll keep this short as most of the other reviews I have read say it all. Everything about the resort from the initial greeting, through to the rooms, food, facilities and service were totally spot on. We did not ask for a specific room or area of the resort, we booked a spa/pool view (not swim out and not Excellence club), we were given a complementary upgrade to an Excellence club room. As you probably know, all the rooms are that same design internally and on the balcony. As far as I could see, the difference with the Excellence club rooms is the inclusion of fruit and spirits (vodka,gin,tequila,whisky,brandy) and a bottle of Champaign etc in the room, a slightly nearer location to the main area (we had room 7254) and use of the Excellence club lounge with drinks, snacks, internet etc. We really did appreciate the club room upgrade.

I can not say with enough enthusiasm how pleased we are that we decided to cross our fingers and hope for the best. It was AMAZING! However, before I share our experience, I must say that the more I travel, the more I realize there are two types of travelers. Neither is tied to a certain race, gender or soci-economic background. Simply put, one is either Grateful or Entitled. Those who choose to be grateful say to themselves \u201cI am so thankful that I have the opportunity and the means to be here. The world does not revolve around me and even if I have shelled out significant amounts of money for this trip, others are still worthy of my respect and patience.\u201d And the latter attitude is one that says \u201cI deserve every penny that I have paid for this trip.

Two different people could share the exact same vacation, down to identical appetizers each night, and yet have vastly different experiences solely based on their perspective. I\u2019m sorry to get on my soap box, but there have been many times while vacationing in Mexico where we\u2019ve been so embarrassed to be an American, based on the extraordinarily self absorbed tirade of the American next to us. Were these people honestly taught by their Mama\u2019s that they were that important?! I\u2019ll acknowledge by nature some people have a Pollyanna personality and others a Scrooge.

Crews are constantly grooming and adding the finishing touches. Palm trees are everywhere. They are not yet totally mature and full, simply because they were transplanted within the last year. But they are tall, majestic and very tropical. Other tropical flowering bushes and trees are beautifully places around the campus, soft lights and candle lit lanterns line the walks at night. The Beach is many peoples biggest disappointment. The sea grass in the water has altered the turquoise crystal clear waters one expects of the Caribbean. However, all of Cancun shares the same ocean and is dealing with the sea grass. It is not an issue specific to Playa Mujeres. Some took a day trip to the Isla Mujeres and rented a golf cart. Apparently, the island is far enough out that sea grass is not an issue and the water is stunning. (the Ferry is constantly on it\u2019s way there and back, I don\u2019t know the cost.) But even at the Excellence Riviera Maya?? , south of the Cancun hotel district, the water has sea grass. I have included a picture if the EPM staff working on removing, by hand the sea grass. Each day, all day they were out there tediously trying to perfect the water! It was still warm and beautiful, and we LOVED that there were no other hotels near us. We walked up and down the beach, without a soul in sight. I should say that if you prefer a super social beach front, lined with hundreds of sun worshiping vacationers, people selling fun trinkets and with lots of opportunities to \u201cpeople watch\u201d, the Hotel district is probably more your style.
