It has a very homey quality with great architectural details. PROS: The room was very spacious and the high ceilings were great, we were on the top floor. The concierge was very helpful and even directed us to our favorite restaurant of the entire trip (awesome place close to the hotel called Azafran). There was a breakfast buffet in the basement area for 2 people for 10euros with good continental choices along with spanish omelette, juice, coffee, etc. Close enough to walk to the city center of Plaza Nueva and Gran Via. Great sitting area in the lobby to just relax and meet other guests of the hotel. CONS: Wifi's spotty if you're on one of the higher floors, more like non-existent actually. The hotel concierge receommended a flamenco show called Venta de Gallos and it really wasn't that great. I guess it was because I was comparing it with this amazing flamenco show in Sevilla at the Alvarez Quintaro theater and I felt so let down and totally disappointed. The climb to the entrance of the hotel is a bit steep and may be difficult for some people and watch out, the rocks are a bit slippery!
