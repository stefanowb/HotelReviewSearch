There was a kitchen but we booked accomodation as a bed and breakfast & so could only use by paying extra. There were 2 large rooms and a wonderful large bathroom. I liked the separation of sink from tub & shower area so two of us could get ready at the same time. My only complaint was the pull out bed in the living area. It was awful. The form was worn out and an adult could not have slept on it. (The bed in the bedroom was quite comfortable.) My teenager made do by piling up the couch cushions. The balcony had a wonderful view and the breakfast was excellent. The staff was friendly and helpful. The nearby town of Monteriggioni was interesting. The tiny store on the road where you turn was very helpful but I would suggest you come with groceries and wine as there is nothing nearby.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "kmjmmm", "date": "July 29, 2004", "id": 2332839}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved the Castelbigozzi", "text": "We were sent to the Castelbigozzi from the small tourist office in Monterrigioni after being unhappy with where we were staying.
