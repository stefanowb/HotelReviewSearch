The pool has hardly any beds but at the weekend when it fills up with obnoxious drunk people that the DJ brings with him you cant get a spot in the pool nevermind a sun lounger.

The pool area itself can be rented out to businesses and during one night of our stay was completely shut off to guests.

The few chairs they have are taken first thing in the morning and the place is crawling with people in their 20s and 30s and DRUNK. By the end of the afternoon the pool area was littered with plates of half eaten food, beer bottles, dirty towels and other garbage these people left. The DJ started at noon and went until 11:30 or 12 at night. The music was a constant \"thump thump thump\" of house/techno mixed in with the noise of bar and pool patrons singing at the top of their lungs. Think of it as a nightclub right in the middle of the property. The drunk partygoers would then spill into the lobby every now and then and harass hotel guests. For a hotel that charges almost $250 per night (and $32 for parking per night) I was appalled that they were ok with all this. Several other guests we spoke to in the lobby were also very disappointed and angry. We demanded a room on the other side of the building to get away from the pool. Our new room was a little quieter but I began to realize that we were smack dab in the midst of more partygoers later that night who had rooms near ours.
