Putting our own luggage onto shuttle and retrieving them at your destination is no big deal and really not worthy of a complaint. On arrival at the hotel which I believe was preceded by a very pleasant drive from airport, there are trolleys available for your convenience to load, albeit, yourself and then can be taken up to your room and returned at a later time to reception. Once again, really no drama. We ourselves arrived very early in the morning and of course our room was not available, I tried, but rules are rules. This is probably my only concern about it being an airport hotel that early arrivals can not be accommodated without the purchase of an early checkin rate. We declined the offer has our deal via their website was less than the early checkin cost so just chose to reorganize ourselves, use their toilet facilities and head back on the shuttle to the airport and subsequent train into Paris where we spent the most fabulous day just walking everywhere, which believe me after a very long flight ex Melbourne was rather daunting at the beginning. On our return decided upon room service which arrived promptly, well presented and hot. Finally bed and slept very well, bed really comfortable but I probably would have slept just as well on the floor as I was so tired. Bathroom spotless with all necessary amenities and breakfast the following morning, a delight with so many options. On our return a month later, everything was as perfect as our first visit, once again no complaints and would not hesitate to return to this hotel on our next visit to Paris. Total convenience even though not right at airport, to me a bonus as less noise, shuttle was easy and prompt, service efficient and friendly and rooms very, very comfortable.
