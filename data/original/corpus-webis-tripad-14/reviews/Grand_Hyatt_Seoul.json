It is an excellent hotel in a privileged location on a little hill in the middle of Seoul. The room was very comfortable, and stylishly designed and furnished. So was the bed. The bathroom is outstanding in terms of design and amenities. There was a coffee maker in the room and a large size flat screen television with CNN and BBC. Everything was clean, in best order and worked immaculately, the only thing missing is an ironing board, but that will be delivered asap upon request. Laundry service fast and good. However, the room windows are sealed so you do not get a fresh breeze. The terrace adjacent to the lobby offers excellent views of the city and is open for breakfast and evening drinks. In the lobby there was a live music band in the evening that tried to be funky and that was a bit disturbing for conversation. There are a lot of smoking areas what I appreciated much as I smoke. For militant non-smokers that could be a bit surprising. Anyhow, the staff is helpful and friendly, check in and out is efficient and you will realize it is definity not a low cost hotel. Due to lack of time, I did not use all of the available infrastructure, but in any case, I would be happy to return to this place again.", "title": "Comfort and Relaxation", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Frequentvoyager", "date": "September 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 20012973, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The well equipped room and bathroom, the breakfast buffet,", "disliked": "\u2014 not enough time to enjoy, the rather high price"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008", "text": "I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Seoul for 2 weeks for business and really enjoyed my stay.

In went my ear plugs - but then I couldn't hear the maid when she barged in at about 9. The poor woman fled leaving the light on. I got up, turned it off, then took a shower, only to find the water pressure ridiculously low. When I checked out I complained about the thin walls, but the front desk clerk's smile never even slipped. Nothing is more infuriating than being asked how you enjoyed your stay, and getting your answer shrugged off with a robotic apology. I got the impression they just don't care. All in all, a whole lot of money to pay (especially with the strong Korean currency) for half a night's sleep and a weak shower.

For the beautiful russet-colored leaves in the autumn, the views of the green hills in the summer, the snow landscapes of the winter. . . and the excellent service-minded and friendly staff.
