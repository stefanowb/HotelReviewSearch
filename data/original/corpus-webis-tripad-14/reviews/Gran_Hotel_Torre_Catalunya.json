Our only complaint would be concerning the restaurant on the 23rd floor - fantastic views over Barcelona (especially at night) but the meal we had there on our first night was very expensive for what it was - and dare I say rather pretentious? The steaks we asked for \"well done\" were all very underdone and full of gristle - practically inedible! The desserts were OK, but one was served on a badly cracked dish - when we complained, they readily offered not to charge for any of the three desserts. Maybe we were just unfortunate to experience this, but we did not eat in the restaurant again during out stay.

They are willing to go out of their way to help you with anything you need. They are lovely and polite. It is however a little business orientated with it's layout but this definately does not effect your stay. If you are there to see the city then it is great although you will have to get the train into the centre as it is too far to walk so bare that in mind. The train station is literally directly next to the hotel which is just perfect for those hoping to visit Sitges (which you have to see!). Sitges is 20 mins by train costing about 3 uk pounds. It is like the Spanish version of St Tropez I suppose and is full of beautiful people, lovely restaurants and shops and a row of different beaches. I say different because there is some nudest beaches and gay beaches. It caters for all tastes. A great place to visit! The hotel will tell you all you need to know. I would have preferred to stay nearer the centre slightly as there is not much to see around the hotel but the centre is only one stop on the train and is not much of a bother. The only annoying thing was when we wanted to eat locallu there was not much around. The trains there are amazing - they go everywhere in Barcelona. The food in the hotel is a little pricey but no more than any other. The pool and spa treatment is wonderful. They have the internet at a cheap price as well. Overall I highly reccomend this hotel but if you are looking for somewhere very near the city and the clubs then this one may not be for you.
