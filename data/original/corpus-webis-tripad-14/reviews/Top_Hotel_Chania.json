Had a very nice stay at the hotel. Lived in a two room apartment in the top floor with a balcony fronting the ocean. The hotel offered everything we needed: A great pool. A great children\u2019s pool. A small playground. A great view. No noisy discos near by. Besides that the hotel staff was very friendly and we had a lot of fun with Sophia and the rest of the staff.", "title": "Super value, service and location!", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Hammerstein", "date": "July 16, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 71164034}], "location": {"country": "Greece", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 1, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 11, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 17}, "aka": "Top Hotel Chania Kato Stalos, Crete", "slim_ranking": 0.142857142857}
