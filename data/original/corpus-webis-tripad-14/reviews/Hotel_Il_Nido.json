The hotel was in a great location - a nice 10 minute walk to the Duomo. We had wine and cheese out in our terrace one evening as the full moon was out ... perfect setting. Our room overlooked the blue sea and the coastline. The room was a good size, nice and clean. The staff were great, always attentive and helpful. The breakfast was buffet with simple selection, but perfect enough to get your morning started. One day, we had breakfast at Amalfi, lunch at Positano and dinner at Ravello ... loved, loved, loved the Amalfi Coast. The hotel offered parking, so this was an added bonus for us. We would definitely choose to stay at Il Nido again when we return to the Amalfi Coast.", "title": "Beautiful view", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "lazybeachdays", "date": "September 10, 2007", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 8687202, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Amazing views from the balcony", "disliked": "\u2014 n/a"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We were recently at Il Nido for 3 nights.
