The location of the hotel is very nice as it is the last hotel on Grace Bay beach. It felt very secluded. The beach is beautiful and we had no problem finding a place to sit. The staff sets up everything you need. The pool is also beautiful but seats were limited and all taken by the time we went down for breakfast at 9:00 am. Very annoying especially because most people did not sit in their \"reserved\" seats until late afternoon! The hotel was filled to capacity so this may have been the cause of this problem. Also, they have special reserved seats on \"islands\" in the pool. We never got a straight answer on how we could get one. Even though the hotel was full, it did not seem overly crowded. The breakfast buffet was great. All the food you could ever want! Lunch was so-so. Would have liked to have seen more lunch options. Had dinner at the hotel twice and it was great both times. Also did room service and it was very quick in the delivery and clean up. The rooms (we booked a 2 bedroom suite) were nice and well appointed. They could use some hooks in the bathrooms as we didn't have a place to hang wet towels. Using the shower was confusing and water spilled out of one of the showers due to a slow drain. There was a kids club that was nice for smaller kids. My daughter (age 7) enjoyed painting and getting her hair braided. My son (age 10) did not want anything to do with it. There was a movie night one night and a bonfire one night for the kids. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and eager to please. Some were more on \"island time\" than others but we expected that. Taxis anywhere on the island were expensive and prices were inconsistent. I think we spent most of our money on taxis and tips!
