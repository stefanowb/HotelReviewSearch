Stairs going down, take you to the multi-media room, with easy chairs to relax, a small library and free internet - stairs going up, take you to the stylish lounge and breakfast area.

Design-features include the Artemide lamp-shades that can be swung in different directions, the nice Grohe taps in the bathroom and the don't disturb magnet to be stuck on the door when in need for some privacy. The rooftop swimming pool and relaxing-area allows you to forget you are actually staying just a short walk from the centre of this great city. So where are the drawbacks you wonder? Of course the neighbourhood is noisy - then again so is every big city. Apart from that there is nothing we can think of.
