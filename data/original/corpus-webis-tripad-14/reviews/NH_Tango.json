Staff were incredibly helpful and obligingly spoke English when faced with our especially poor Spanish. Spacious, clean, modern room. Good selection for breakfast. Fitness room was very small, but sauna looked brand new! Upgraded to a suite on the last night- no extra charge and was even more spacious and luxurious with free bathrobes etc. Also stored some baggage for us for 4 days which was very useful. Its actually right next door to Tango Porteno- which we had unknowingly booked for a show and I would also recommend for an entertaining evening.
