The staff were great and the room excellent. Had all amenities - the breakfast buffet was lovely and fresh each day and room service was excellent. A few points though - one day we got back from walking around London all day and were disappointed to find our room not made up but a quick call to housekeeping fixed it. My only gripe is they asked to take a $100 holding deposit which I said was fine but when booking out asked the lady behind the desk to make sure that was cancelled, as I had paid my bill in cash in full. On returning home to Australia I saw the money had been withdrawn from my credit card. They should only take an indent of my card - not actually take my money unless I did not pay. Except for that - the hotel was wonderful and would definitely recommend it to people to stay there.", "title": "Excellent hotel - pity about the deposit 'held' on my credit card", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Karen B", "date": "January 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 123422218}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "From the front it looks like a 70s office block.
