If people on the sidewalk stopped or were talking on the phone outside our room window their conversations were completely audible. Sirens throughout the night felt and sounded as though they would come right through the room. At one point a family member paid $2.00 for a bottle soda from a vending machine. They stated it tasted poorly, and alas the expiration date had come and gone. A computer in the lobby requires a credit card and WiFi is a charge, too.

My husband complained to the front desk and the noise did go down a little, and eventually at 5:30 it stopped. There were 3 groups booked into the hotel that day, one of them being high school kids who come to Boston for Uni visits. The next night was slightly better but the layout of the hotel is over 2 floors and there was an exit door at the end of the corridor which can be accessed 24 hrs, meaning that guests can come in this door without going past the front desk- resulting in many young people going past your room at all hours-noisy. I spoke with the manager on the second morning asking if the group leaders could remind their groups that other guests were staying in the hotel, and he informed me that the group was checking out that day- hurrah. However when we arrived back that evening another group of kids were checking in- my husband spoke to a very understanding girl at the desk, who said that this group were in rooms all over the hotel, but she could move us to another room at the back of the hotel which would be quieter. We then had the last 2 nights in peace. So I would recommend that if you intend to stay here in March/ April- ask for a quiet room.
