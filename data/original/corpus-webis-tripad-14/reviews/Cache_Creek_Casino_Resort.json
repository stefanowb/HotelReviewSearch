You can have a private cabana at the pool and drink service, but with only one pool (nice, but not incredibly large) for adults and children, it is really not a relaxing atmosphere for an adult. I know they are doing an expansion in the next few years - adding 400+ room and another pool.

We live in San Francisco and wanted some place that was easy to get to, but still had a splurgy, getaway feel. This place fit the bill perfectly. We will be back. The rooms are large and well-appointed- I'd say it was just as nice as the room I stayed in at the Bellagio in Vegas. The pool area is lovely, with misters and cabanas, a fireplace and a hot tub...scenery is nice too. I thoroughly enjoy my spa experience - the facilities are fantastic.

It was recently remodeled - lots of stone work and natural materials, beautiful, spacious rooms, bathrooms have a large shower and bathtub, beds are very comfortable with down comforters, restaurants are from average fast food to a fabulous, 5-star restaurant with extensive menu and great wine list. Spa was terrific - massages, jacuzzi, sauna, etc. BUT - housekeeping was spotty (one room was NEVER cleaned during a two-night stay, another partially cleaned), check-in was delayed for almost 3 hours and, the worst of all, smoking is allowed EVERYWHERE. Just a walk through the casino leaves your clothes stinky. We were ready to play some poker or blackjack but never did because of the cigarette smoke. Thousands of slot machines but, again, cigarettes everywhere. Cache Creek could be a first class resort but probably not likely to change.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "March 28, 2005", "id": 3308532}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Miles from no where", "text": "Well let's see, Our room was great, just the right size for 2 adults and the new pool rather small in size but was awesome. We went on a saturday night and the casino was packed ,there was no room to walk all the smoke and people where a turn off but we had a good time. It seems that there was a long walk to the elevators and they took forever to get to the 5th floor.There's plenty of place's to eat and the casino layout is alright but it's a casino in Calif and if your used to Nevada casino's your in for a big susprise. If you have time and your in the area it's worth the stay. Remember that there's NOTHING in the area for 20 miles so bring what you need. The place is rather expensive , so bring plenty of money without the one arm bandits. C-ya soon.
