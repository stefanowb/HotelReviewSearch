All three times we've had front desk people that were very aloof and almost to the point of being rude both at check-in and check-out. Not a good way to start off a fun filled weekend. Third time is a charm because the hotel proved that they were consistant. The hotel is starting to show some wear. The bathroom in our room had a sink drain that was rusted and dirty, there was still wall paper paste that didn't get cleaned off when it was installed, the light above the sink was burned out and the lights around the mirror were both cool and warm flourescents so they didn't match. The reason that we gave it two stars instead of one is because we had two great valet/shuttle guys. Zack was cheerful and went out of his way to be helpful on several occasions and we also had a gentleman in his 50's that was delightful as well.
