With the exception of the reception staff who were friendly and welcoming the dining room staff spoke little English and were not particularly friendly or welcoming. The solmelier had absolutely no idea about wine - poured our wine by reaching across infront of us and offered wine to one of our party, \"you want wine lady?\" Not exactly what you expect of a 5* hotel with wines averaging \u00a345 a bottle. Pool was clean, warm and quiet, infact all you could hope ...... but why are so many pools these days so SHALLOW! The deep end was only 150cms and for about a third of its length the pool is only 1 meter deep. I`m sure it`s very safe and great fun if swimming in a children`s pool is your thing............ perhaps that`s why the pool was always empty! The spa is good. Again Eastern European girls make up a high proportion of the staff but the treatments we had were excellent and the girls friendly. The food was only adequate at dinner and breakfast too was adequate. Beware the porridge unless you enjoy thin gruel! Would have preferred a breakfast buffet but that`s just a personal thing. So, overall what`s it like? Well it`s definitely NOT 5* standard, it`s a good 4* but quite an expensive one!", "user": "supermummy", "date": "June 16, 2007", "id": 7855531}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Really was one of best hotels we stayed, ever!", "text": "My wife and I took a one week tour of Ireland in Oct 2006.

The staff were Incredible, the decor fantastic, the Day Spa services were bliss - just watch out for Mary she gives a mean Remedial Massage. We travelled all over Ireland and stayed twice at The Killarney Park Hotel, the 2nd time we visited we were immediately upgraded, well what a treat!

The hotel is immaculate, well located, and comfortable. The rooms are big and airy; the fireplace was lit each evening. The breakfast was classy yet comfortable. The pool and exercise room were amazing for a small hotel. However what makes the Killarney Park so amazing was the service. I swear that they could anticipate my requests even before I asked.

It was a wonderful experience and the staff went out of their way to make things as comfortable as possible for us. We received a complementary upgrade to a suite which was a godsend as we had travelled with everything including the kitchen sink for the baby. A fridge and high chair were given to us for the room and at all times our request for privacy was adhered to as we tried to get the baby down for sleeps during the day. The pool was great and we were able to introduce our daughter to the joys of swimming. The treatments I had in the spa were very relxaing and I would definitely recommend. Food in the bar was delicious.

Our room was huge, and more traditional decor but very comfortable. We ate in both the bar for snack food at lunch, and in the hotel restaurant one evening.....all food was excellent as was the service. Great atmosphere in the bar in the evening.
