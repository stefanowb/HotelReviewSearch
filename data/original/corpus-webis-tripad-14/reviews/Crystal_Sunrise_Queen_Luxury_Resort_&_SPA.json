This resulted in us having a 'girls' room and a 'boys' room for the holiday as I was not prepared to leave the children on their own further down the landing. Air conditioning system in the hotel is poor, the inside public areas are very humid and despite having our air conditioning on in the room for 24 hrs on the coolest setting is was never cold. Final moan - people smoking. The hotel does not permit smoking inside but everywhere else smoking is allowed. In the main restaurant there are 2 small NO SMOKING parts but everywhere else people smoke. You could be sat by the pool, on the beach, eating your lunch/dinner or in one of the many bars and be surrounded by smokers. We had to leave one of the bars one night as it reminded me of what pubs used to be like in the UK before the ban - horrible.

One sign of a good hotel is the staff, and it was so nice that most of the staff from last year are still there. The turkish people have amazing memories they see thousands of tourists all year yet they still all remembered us which was really nice. I love the way Ali Ucas the General Manager operates, he walks round the hotel like a tourist, wherever you go he seems to be there, he eats in the restaurants and just mingles in which is brilliant. Nothing deters the staff, one morning all the tables were laid outside for breakfast and it started to rain, within 15minutes the staff had transferred everyone to an indoor restaurant with no fuss whatsoever.

We had a wonderful time last year and it didn't disappoint us on our return as they had made even more improvements to the hotel. As a family with 2 older children (mid 20's) there is plenty to keep everyone happy at this hotel. On our arrival all of the staff were friendly and welcoming and our room was spacious and clean. The week was fabulous thanks to the animation team who provided light hearted entertainment during the day time next to the pool and a variety of performances at night. The team was friendly and got us involved in aqua aerobics and other things to keep us occupied. Whilst offering excellent entertainment, there was also an adult only pool for times when you wanted a quieter few hours. The pool areas, as are all the other areas of the hotel were clean and tidy, we had no problems getting sunbeds or umbrellas which is always a relief. As a picky family when it comes to the food, we had nothing to complain about... the food was tasty and had a great selection in the buffets (the lunch time buffet area had been improved since last year with building works). During our stay we visited 3 of the A la carte restuarants - the turkish, the mexican and the fish restuarants - all had fantastic food and the service was outstanding. We also attended a returning guest dinner which was absolutely brilliant, the food was phenomenal and it was nice to see the managers of the hotel mixing with the guests. All of the staff across the hotel made such an effort and their English was extremely good, many of the staff had remembered us from the previous year so it was great to see so many familiar and friendly faces ! The hotel itself is beautifully maintained and sits in a lovely spot overlooking the sea, the way it is terraced allows you to see the sea from every bar and restuarant or whilst sitting in a quiet garden spot. Each bar had a wide selection of drinks available and the effort that went into making each cocktail was lovely. With it being a short walk into Side (walking very slowly it took approximately 45 minutes along the beautiful promenade at the sea front), it is perfect for a walk in late at night when it is slightly cooler!
