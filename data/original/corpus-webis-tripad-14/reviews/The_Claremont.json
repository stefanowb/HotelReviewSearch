Reading the customer information it seemed you could ask for help with most things and it would be given, but it would be better if some of this was anticipated - eg fresh milk would be nice without having to make a special request - I can't imagine many people prefer the cartons of UHT. Given the price of the rooms I also think they could include the price of a parking voucher (\u00a33 for 24 hours).
