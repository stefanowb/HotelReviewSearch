The room was big enough for a double bed and ample room next to it for our bags. There was a tv, though we didn't check if there were English channels (probably not), kettle, hair dryer, trouser press in the hallway, and a large shelf along one wall which made a great desk for all our electricals. There was only a shower in our bathroom (and the usual toilet with lots of gadgets), but the rooftop onsen fulfilled any desire for a bath. The onsens are single sex, and the female side needs a special pass number to get into, which the man at reception gave me on check-in. The women's onsen was gorgeous, with an outdoor and indoor onsen as well as sauna and lots of shower cubicles. They also provided nice toiletries to use afterwards. My boyfriend tells me that the men's side was just as nice.", "title": "Great room and fab rooftop onsen", "user": "snowybennett", "date": "March 12, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 154321027}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We really liked the Dormy Inn and would stay here again if we came back through the area.
