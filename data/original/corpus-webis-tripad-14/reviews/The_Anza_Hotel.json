Why would you as a hotel owner/manager not want your guests to always have clean rooms and take pride in your housekeeping? Towels are thin,thin,thin and the soap is about the size of a half dollar...come on, how much could a bar of soap cost? One waste basket in the room, one phone in the room and its not near the bed. Its these little things that get mised when corners are cut. Just missed the mark, but there is still time to fix it.
