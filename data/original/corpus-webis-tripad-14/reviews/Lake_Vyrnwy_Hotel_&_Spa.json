Avoid the room above the kitchen at all costs though as this is very small, very hot and very noisy. This was the only down side of one stay, but the rest of the hotel, food, location and ambience made up for our disappointment. Our two subsequent visits have been greatly enjoyed - the newly decorated rooms are a vast improvement in style and comfort. If I could live here I actually would! Love the views of the lake and the hills, love the comfy lounge area with the real fires and twinkly lights, love the drawing room and the stylish furnishings, love the high quality food and love the friendly, helpful staff. My only slight critisism would be that the Tower Bar has had an overhaul and turned into a brightly lit bistro - I prefered the low lit comfort of the decor as it was previously.

The food in both the hotel and Tavern \"pub\" was excellent and was only rivalled by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff, who evidently work very hard and do all that they can to make your stay as special as possible.

A bit of a rush, but with such a late check-in this was the only timetable possible to fit it all in. However, on arrival at the spa, I was told they were running 'a few minutes late' and directed to the waiting area (no magazines to read, just a price list of treatments and products available). I kept being apologetically told 'a few minutes longer' until finally at 5.30 they were ready for my treatment. It was very good (a back wrap with moor mud and deep massage, expertly performed by Elliwy, the Spa Manager) and highly recommended albeit rather expensive, as are all the treatments). But the long delay meant that by the time I returned to our room my husband didn't have time to visit the spa, which was very disappointing and neither his nor my fault. I mentioned this to the girl on the spa reception as I left, and she just shrugged her shoulders. So I mentioned it to the Hotel General Manager the next morning. I was rather curtly told that the spa operates a strict adherence to appointment times and he had never known of such a delay and couldn't imagine how it had happened. Given his disdainful manner he may as well have called me a liar. Nevertheless, he said he would speak to the spa manager and get back to me.
