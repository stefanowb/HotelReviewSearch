Every hotel staff I encountered always greeted me with a smile, including the cleaners, concierge, and staff serving the breakfast.

The hotel staff was very friendly, patient and personable when asked about local restaurants, while this hotel is easy to get to when travelling on the 401. Right next door is a Keg Steak House, while other restaurants are within driving distance - probably the only downside if you dont feel like a steak at the Keg or eating at McDonalds. The front lobby decor is very inviting and reminded me of being at a beautiful chalet. Unfortunately I never got to enjoy the breakfast, buy the hotel lobby appeared nicely set up for relaxing or sititng at a table and working away.

But when a cockroach made its presence known upon entering the room we'd reserved at a nearby hotel, we hit the road. It was late in the evening when, frazzled, I arrived at the desk of the Holiday Inn Express Toronto East. Peter Atawa was sympathetic and delightful, telling us that it was our good fortune to have landed at his hotel. He gave us a choice of beds and prices and did his best to come up with a rate we could afford.

The lobby was very nice but the hallway smelled old and so did the room. The bathtub plumbing was not secured to the wall. The tv was very small and old,very fuzzy. Nice furniture in the room. Vending machines would only take quarters and front desk staff never anted to give up there change. We had to pay extra for parking each night. On a good note the breakfast was good. We found most of the staff to be very fake. There is no wireless internet. Not good when you rely on it. When the two of us checked in they gave us one free bottle of water and a ganola bar, not much for the other person in the room. The hotel was very hot. We kept the A/C on the whole stay but the lobby and hallways were very hot. I would not recommend this hotel. Much better lookng hotel next door. The new Best Western in the next parking lot.

My only complaint was the wired Internet, as I would have liked to have been able to sit in one of the more comfortable chairs in the room while on my computer, or to have been able to watch a movie with my laptop on my bedside table.
