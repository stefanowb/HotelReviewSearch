They could not accommodate this the first night and we stayed in two rooms across from the laundry on the first floor. When we opened the doors, the problems began. Despite the fact that the front desk manager assured us that the cleaning staff spend 25 minutes on each room, they were very dirty. I realized the hotel was at capacity the first night, but the dark wood headboards showed obvious nasty \"stains\". There was dirt on the walls as well - we went back to the front desk and had the cleaners come in again. We also requested adjoining rooms for the second night away from the noisy laundry. We got them on the third floor - one smoking, one not - adjoining nevertheless. The rooms were just as dirty with stains on the walls, headboards, TV, linen, etc. This time, however, we were armed with Lysol wipes!! Unfortunately when we turned on the air conditioner in the room that wasn't non-smoking, we could distinctly smell cigarette smoke! :(. Since we had requested two non-smoking rooms and there were only 9 rooms rented in the hotel that second night (according to the front desk manager), we were hugely disappointed! We also found a previous guest's opened bag of Doritos behind the night stand, hair all over the floor in the washroom, and other such dirt on the walls. So much for cleaning standards.
