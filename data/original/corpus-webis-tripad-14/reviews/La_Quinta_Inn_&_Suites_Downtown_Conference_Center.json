I just returned (9 October) from a conference which they hosted and was very pleased with my experience. Don't expect a luxury hotel, but I found it to be a very satisfactory standard hotel. The parking garage was immediately behind the hotel and you only had to cross an alley (limited access alley) between the parking garage and the hotel - about 10 yards at most. There were absolutely no panhandlers nor did I see where ones would have located themselves between the garage and the hotel. I found no problems with the temperature of the water and the room was kept as clean as a normal hotel. I used the wireless high speed internet connection without a problem and they offer hardwire high speed access if you do not have a wireless card. The only adverse comments I had were that one lamp did not have a bulb in it and a collegue of mine had a dirty glass in his bathroom. Neither of these would I consider totally unexpected at what I would describe as standard accomodations. Although I normally stay at another hotel chain when I travel, I would have no problem staying here again if the situation presented itself.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 9, 2005", "id": 4003442}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "How dirty can it be?", "text": "Date of visit: 9 August 2004 on a 100 degree day.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "PlayfulPlatypus", "date": "August 13, 2005", "id": 3759930}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not for females traveling alone", "text": "This Clarion Hotel on Broadway in downtown Little Rock might as well have been a flop house for drug dealers and homeless people. The air conditioning in the hallways and lobby was not working adequately. There were fans on each floor to circulate the air. If you want breakfast, there is a McDonalds with lots of bustling activity next door. Supposedly there is a bar and restaurant at the hotel, nobody occupied the seats in that area but then again, the air conditioning was not adequate. On three different occasions, walking between the garage and the hotel, different people asked us for money. The carpets in the lobby and elevators have dark stains on them. The TV reception is almost like they have no cable and are using an antenna. The reception that you are allowed is edited by SkyAngel. There was no hot water--lukewarm was all there was. When we asked the front desk where the workout room was, we were told it was next door and that they only had one key and a person was using it. We finally found the workout room on the second floor. All of the plug in lights were unplugged. When we got to our rooms, which had been reserved in advance, the air conditioning was not on--sauna rooms is what we found. Luckily, after 2 hours, the air cooled enough to be bearable.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "August 11, 2005", "id": 3755767}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2005", "text": "My company booked me and several co-workers in this hotel because it was within walking distance of the place we would be working.
