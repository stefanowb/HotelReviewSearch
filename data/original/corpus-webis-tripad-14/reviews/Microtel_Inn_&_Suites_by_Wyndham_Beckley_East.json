The rooms were so/so when is came to cleanliness. The beds were clean but everything else seemed very neglected. Considering we were paying $90/night I expected it to be a little better. My reservation was screwed up when I checked in as they had my name on 4 rooms rather than 2. And now that I am home, I see that my credit card has been charged for 3 rooms rather than two. I was told they have to try and figure out who had the room and try to get a hold of that person to get payment before they will credit me!! I have been trying to get them to reverse the charge for almost a week. No one seems to know what they are doing and no one seems to want to help resolve this issue. I get excuse after excuse.
