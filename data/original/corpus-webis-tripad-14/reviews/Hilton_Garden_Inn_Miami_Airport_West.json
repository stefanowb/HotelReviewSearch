Thankfully someone staying at the hotel was able to let us in while we were waiting in the lobby calling for someone at the front desk for a while after that we checked into 2 rooms (mom also joined us in Miami) and both rooms very beautiful however our room smelled horribly of smoke, even though it is said to be a non- smoking room. It was late so we didn't want to go through the hassle of changing our room. the next day we had someone just spray air-freshener around the room , as when we went to ask for a room change they had no more available rooms and the next day would have been our last.

The hotel offers free internet, free parking, and has an outdoor hot tub and pool. The fitness center has a nice selection of equipment and met my needs. The only negative about this hotel is the location. It's adjacent to an industrial area and is located right in the path of a runway. Planes do fly directly overhead from time to time and may produce some jet noise in the rooms, although I didn't find the noise to be that bad. For some reason this hotel considers it an upgrade to get a room facing the airport and downtown.....all you really see is an industrial park so avoid paying for the upgrade and hope you get a pool view instead.

The staff at this hotel was very friendly, but it did not make up for the poor quality of the food, the uncomfortable beds and the awful location. The room service meal we ordered was cold and tasteless (they also forgot something and asked us to come down and get it!) The breakfast buffet, which cost $12, was worse than the complimentary meals we usually receive at comparable hotels; my husband and I both thought the eggs were the worst we ever had. Moreover, the beds were not very comfortable and the compressor on our mini-refrigerator was so loud that it woke us up several times in the night. Also, the location of the hotel is only good if you need to be at the airport very early in the morning, but it sounds at though the shuttle is not reliable. The hotel is right in the landing path of the airport. Planes fly directly over the hotel (only a couple hundred of feet above the building). Finally, the hotel is not that close to any nice area, it is also not well marked from the road and it is dangerous to get in and out of; you risk life and limb trying to walk anywhere.

The woman at the front desk was extremely nice and very helpful. When I had trouble printing our boarding pass in the business center. She did it for me. She was quick to offer suggestions for dinner. We were too tired to go out and take her up on her suggestion, which was a shame because the Cuban restaurant she mentioned sounded good. We just ordered something there and took it to our room. Good food. And plenty of it. We ordered a sandwich to share and it was more than enough for the two of us.
