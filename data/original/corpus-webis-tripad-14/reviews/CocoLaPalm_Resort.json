We had stayed several years ago and decided to try them again after getting a great deal on a Junior Suite with the included Continental breakfast. As a repeat customer and with luck on our side, we snagged room number 526. It was excellently located, with a peekaboo view of the ocean through the trees. Nice and quiet, large and comfy.", "title": "Second Stay, Wonderful Setting", "user": "jodi_123", "date": "December 26, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188604021}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "A few small issues came up with the room and were addressed promptly, sometimes a little too prompt (did they need to work on the light and fan in the middle of my wonderful massage?!). We did notice a few ants when we left out some food, so use the fridge for any leftovers or open food items. Also, the air conditioning unit had a very bright display of the temperature right by the bed, enough that we didn't need a night light. We ended up throwing a washcloth over it, wished we had a little piece of duct tape.", "title": "A Beautiful Place to Relax and Rejuvenate", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "oldteacher25", "date": "December 25, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 188498368}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled with family", "text": "The included breakfast was pretty good, several days we split the continental and one of the larger meals, the omelets and banana bread were very good.
