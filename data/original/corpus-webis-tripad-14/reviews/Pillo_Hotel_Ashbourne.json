The directions on the hotel website were easy to follow. On arrival I was surprised how modern the hotel looked. I had spoken to Marion in reservations and she was very pleasant in reserving our room. A lady called Susan welcomed us in reception, and was most helpful. We were close to Blanchardstown shopping centre and spent time shopping. The hotel has a pool and leisure centre, unfortunately we didnot have time to use it. The room we had was on the fifth floor and was absolutely gergeous, it was sparkling clean and we were very pleased with it. later that evening we dined in the red bar, although quite contempary I liked it. The food was really good, as I myself work in the hospitality industry and I appreciated the effort gone into our food, I had the fish in a beer batter and my other half had roast chicken with champ and roasted vegetables which were delicious. The only down side of the red bar was the service, not with the food but with the drink. the waiteress in behind the bar left me there for ten mins and did not even give me eye contact. Eventually I called her. The breakfast the next morning was good, and the service was excellent. Upon checking out I mentioned to the receptionist that the service for drink was very slow, she profusely apologised and said that they had some temporary staff employed for the season. I would accept that comment. Overall the next time I visit I will make an appointment for the spa which was booked out.
