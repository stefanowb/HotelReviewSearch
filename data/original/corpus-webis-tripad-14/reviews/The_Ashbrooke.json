It proved to be an excellent choice. The bathroom was spotless. I took a bath in the practically sparkling white tub which was nicely-sized. It was quiet at all times of day, although we didn't spend any time in our room during the afternoon hours. The room was spacious and we took advantage of the free DVD rental on a chilly evening that we wanted to spend indoors. Climate control in the room works wonderfully, so the temperature was always set to our liking. The only drawback to the Ashbrooke is that it is not on the waterfront.

There were muffins and good coffee along with a nice fireplace in the reception area, unfortunately you had to walk out of our building to get there and it did not have a table and chairs to comfortably enjoy our coffee and the fireplace.

We had a 2nd level Brighton room which was very big and well maintained. We had two issues during our stay. The refrigerator did not work but Ice was available and plentiful. The 32\" LCD TV was mounted on the wall and you could clearly hear the neighbors TV. Several times during our stay, the neighbor would turn up his TV in response to our TV being on. I guess that an armoire would buffer the sound some but not with a wall mount. Most of the Brighton rooms face the highway and the noise from the traffic does not calm down until around 7pm in the fall. The hot tub was very large and hot. The pool was great for lap swimming. The hotel does provide an enclosed area for your bicycles with a rack to lock them up. Wifi in the room was excellent. The hotel offers a free USA Today paper daily near the front desk.

The hotel's location was perfect for us, a short walk from the main dinner options in Egg Harbor and an easy drive to reach Fish Creek and other Door County attractions in the mid- and upper-peninsula. We enjoyed coffee and muffins outside in the morning; great way to start a vacation day. But if you're looking for something more substantial for breakfast, there's a cafe about 100 yards down the road (we didn't go so I can't comment other than to say the parking lot was full on Sunday morning when we left).
