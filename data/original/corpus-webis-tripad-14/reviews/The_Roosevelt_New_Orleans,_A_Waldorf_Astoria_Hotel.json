I got upgrade to a king superior room, and had asked for a high floor away from the street. They have two interior facing groups of rooms (no good view but quiet), and it was well worth the lack of view. Canal St adjacent to the building (and very nearby Bourbon St) can be very noisy, but I heard none of it. The interior doors and hallways were quiet, and the walls between the rooms were absolutely noise free. My only complaints were that nothing was complimentary (no breakfast, no free business center), but that seems to be the way of big city nice hotels. I stayed at two other NOLA hotels in this trip, and this was my favorite hands down. Whether it was a true 5 star hotel or not is really immaterial.
