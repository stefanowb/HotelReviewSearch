It has nice location and fairly central - in the midway between the main railway station of Szczecin and city centre shopping. The room was standard, but clean, comfortable and had everything I needed for short term stay (maybe except the hairdryer). Linens provided and towels are changed daily. Free mineral water in the room. Wi-Fi is free and work fast. Most everything at breakfast was quite good, including the service as well as the food, however, it's a little overpriced. There is a possibility to use garage parking space for extra fee (25 zl per day).
