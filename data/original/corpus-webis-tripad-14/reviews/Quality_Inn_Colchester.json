The breakfast space is very nice and roomy, even at the morning rush-- with a better selec tion of items than most places, including eggs, french toast, and the now ubiquitous waffle maker. The corrdors seem a little worn, perhaps some restoration is being planned.

The pool is very nice and clean, but if you don't like to hear children playing in the pool, get a first floor or outside room.....it was kind of loud. They have a nice complimentary breakfast buffet with a do-it-yourself waffle maker, eggs, sausage, cereal, fruit, & yogurt. It was easy to find and close to where we needed to go at UVM.
