So many things were wrong with the service, the host, the waitstaff and the food that its difficult to find a place to begin. Maybe slipping the host a $20 dollar bill would have gotten one of the \"special\" tables by a window (several were open). Mentioning an anniversary celebration was not even returned with an insincere congratulations. First words out of the waiter's mouth were, \"The specials tonight are....\" Had to stop him right there and call him by the name on his badge by saying, \"Good evening.\" for him and ask him \"How he was doing this evening\". The food, while overpriced, was average. It took nearly an hour to get the meal, had the feeling it was prepared ahead of time, and our plates sat in front of us a long time after we had finished. I don't mind paying top dollar if its worth it, but the Ahwahnee is a farce. Too high of expectations? Maybe, but then bad is bad no matter what your level of expectation. For a contrast and a profoundly different experience, drive the Tioga Pass to Whoa Nellie's Deli at the Mobil gas station in Lee Vining and experience the uniqueness that the Ahwahnee wishes it possesses.

What we found was that the room was in sad disrepair. The upholstery on the guest chairs in the room was worn and frayed. The chairs themselves were so low that we had to add pillows to the seats in order to be comfortable. It was the largest bathroom we have encountered on any trip, anywhere, but the sink and counter were uncomfortably low for me at 5'3\" and very low for my 6'2\" husband. The biggest disappointment was that the room was called, and priced as, a SUITE when in fact it was a room with a bath like most of the rooms in the hotel. We were there for a 3 night stay. After our 2nd night in the room we asked to be changed to other accomadations which the staff accomplished with grace and speed. Five stars for the staff, 1-2 stars for the accomadations booked. The current management has removed a lot of the amenities and pleasure from a stay at the Ahwahnee, but we will return.", "helpfulness": 13, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 23, 2005", "id": 3607006}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "5 star setting; 3 star service", "text": "We stayed at the Ahwahnee for one night.

But, our room wasn't ready at 4:00, there was a maintenance problem in the room and no evidence that they worked on it, and they scheduled work on the deck so we \"enjoyed\" it while work was going on.
