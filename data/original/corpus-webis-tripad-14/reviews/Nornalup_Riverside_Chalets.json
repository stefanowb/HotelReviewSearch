Ours was the front chalet with the most wonderful view (Blue Wren). The birdlife was tremendous with lots of parrots and wrens and kayaks were available if you fancied a paddle on the river. Although a little dated in decor, the chalet was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The Nornalup TeaHouse next door provided us with the most fantastic dinner though is not open every night. Try the marron. Whilst in the area go on the Eco cruise from Walpole - entertainment and an insight into the wildlife and history of the area is guaranteed. The Tree Top walk is another must but the best of all was Greens Pool in Williams Bay on the way to Denmark - a little piece of paradise.", "title": "Peace and tranquility", "user": "UKBells", "date": "March 29, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 102058369}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "A hidden gem. Right on the river near the wonderful town of Walpole. Many parrots. Great hosts. A true bargain and centrally located for many points of interest. Don't fail to go to William Bay, it's the most beautiful beach I've ever seen. Only possible negative is the lack of air conditioning, but this is a cool weather location.

The chalet was very spacious, one of the few places we have stayed at which would genuinely sleep a large number of people in comfort. The chalet was very clean and a very short stroll to the beautiful Frankland River. There are some river views (depending on which chalet you book). Kitchen was adequate. Bathroom clean and very spacious. Log fire was very efficient. The chalets are also next door to the Nornalup Teahouse Restaurant - by far and away the best food for miles (including local wineries, which seem to have very limited menus).", "title": "Clean, comfortable chalets close to beautiful river", "user": "wanderlust2006", "date": "September 18, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 42580112}], "location": {"country": "Australia", "continent": "South Pacific", "city": "Nornalup"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 2, "very good": 6, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 10}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
