Our room was #12 which was on the first floor with a balcony and a fantastic view. The room was clean and by European standards, spacious. The front desk people were always helpful with directions and also with booking a dinner up in the hills at a great trattoria. Yes it was a little noisy in the morning, but you have to remember you are in Italy now. The great breakfast was a super way to start the day. I would definitely stay here again on our next visit. One sour note was the Belvedere Restaurant in Monterosso which had ill mannered waiters and marginal food. So Rick Steves dropped the ball on this tratoria. But Rick was right on the money about Madame Dumonts chocolate in Brugge. One note for the parking lot. Driving in you will see a right turn for Fegini. Take this turn. The lot is at the end of this road.", "title": "what a view", "user": "Davidinbc", "date": "July 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5437905}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Unethical", "text": "2 months ahead of going to Monterosso I booked a SEAVIEW room for 6 nights.
