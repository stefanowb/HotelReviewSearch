For the daily rates we are paying you would think they could afford to squeeze in free WiFi (and I don't mean the 30 mins per day you get restricted to their Business Ctr in the lobby). Perhaps it's a BA thing (but I don't think so) that people wouldn't mind taking yr money but couldn't be bothered cracking a smile to earn it. It's like Customer Service is beneath them. The concierge makes it plain that our requests are more an imposition than an obligation on the part of the hotel for the money we have parted with.

The Sheraton utterly fails in this regard. When we checked in, we asked for a quiet room, away from the street. Instead we were given a room on the third floor, directly overlooking an extremely noisy street, and right next to the elevator. We asked for a new room. We were moved to precisely the same location, this time on the 17th floor. Even at that height, the room at night was like trying to sleep in the middle of a traffic jam. Plus, people getting off the elevators woke us up all night. We had two small kids with us, and can't understand why our request for at least a relatively quite room couldn't be accommodated. I believe it's because we had a special room rate, and we were given the worst rooms. While I understand that hotels do this to, e.g., Priceline customers (1) I've never been refused a quiet room when asking the 2nd time; (2) we were not Priceline customers, but had a special rate because my company does hundreds of thousands of dollars of business with the hotel each year'; and (3) no modern hotel, much less a Sheraton, should have such poorly insulated windows that a 17th floor room is so noisy!", "title": "MUCH too Noisy", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "danielbeez", "date": "December 27, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 90847363}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Finally, the next day we moved to the 22nd floor, to a club room overlooking the river instead of the street.
