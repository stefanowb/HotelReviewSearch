I was drawn to Connaught by the current afternoon tea menu on the Connaught/Esplette web page but unfortunately the menu we were offered on the day was altered (I was looking forward to the ginger scones and rose and raspberry cake, but sadly these were off the menu). The sandwhiches are average, with the exception of the chicken teriyaki paninis which were really lovely. We had been presented with 5 cakes on our stand and one rum baba, it was clear that these had been designed and made with care and skill and they tasted delicious, but with only one of each, we had to rather messily split them all in two. We were not offered any refills, in fact we felt rather rushed. I asked the waiter if I could order more than one type of speciality jam with the scones, and he reluctantly informed me that we could, but usually people were only allowed one! For me, afternoon tea is a treat, a decadent experience to enjoy and share. I don't want to feel rushed, or as if cakes are in short supply. For example, I asked the waiter if I could have an extra cake, and he replied that he would go and ask!

Please don't misunderstand me, both of those are fine hotels and if you specifically need to be in those locations then they will deliver with aplomb. The Connaught, however, combines both their qualities - the old worldliness and luxury of Claridge's with the modernity of the Berkeley. This success is, in part, due to the old and new wings of the hotel. If a more traditional 5 star hotel in the vein of the Dorchester or Claridge's is to your taste then opt for the old wing, the standard rooms do lack somewhat for space but the suites are a delight.
