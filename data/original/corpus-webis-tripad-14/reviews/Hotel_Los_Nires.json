This is a good hotel, located outside of the town center, with a beautiful mountain back drop. The two cons are somewhat significant: our large room window with a view of the mountains also looked out at the hotel restaurant (kind of killed any romance). And the hotel shuttle to the main town only left once an hour or once every two hours. However, if we missed the shuttle, we took a taxi which only cost about 12-13 pesos (or $4 dollars) and the taxi drivers were all rather friendly and fun. So it wasn't a problem at all.", "user": "bbjj0827", "date": "January 8, 2008", "id": 12450981}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Hotel; A Bit Distant", "text": "The pros include helpful staff that arranged a tour of the beagle channel through one of the companies located on the pier (made life much easier); big room and comfortable bed; big bathroom; great breakfast; common living room with TV that had english speaking channels.
