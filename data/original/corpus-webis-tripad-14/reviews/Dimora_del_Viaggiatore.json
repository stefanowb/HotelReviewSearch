We booked 2 rooms as we were travelling with 2 adult nephews. On arrival we were informed the manager had decided it would be better if we shared one room. There was no other option as the other rooms were booked. The room was in poor condition with dodgy electrics and furniture that was falling apart. The breakfast we were offered was very poor and some items of doubtful age. After several emails and despite getting two acknowledgments and 2 receipts we failed to get a refund on our other room as the manager insisted the room we were in was tariffed as 145 euros - it wasnt worth one third of this. The property had no significant faclilities, wifi only worked right outside the office downstairs in the breakfast area which was infested with mosquitoes. Avoid this place like the plague - far and away the worst we have ever stayed at.", "title": "A shambles from start to finish", "user": "ukbod", "date": "September 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 176599070}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2013", "text": "We stayed at Dimora del Viaggiatore 2, at number 157.
