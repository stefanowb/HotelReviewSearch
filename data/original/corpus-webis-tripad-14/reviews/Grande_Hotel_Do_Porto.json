Thought it may be noisy in the evening but rooms were located away from the main street and was quiet. Great location to get around in the city too.

We arrived in the morning before our room was ready, but we were checked in and our bags whisked safely away in moments, and given a handy map to the city. After a four- or five-hour walking tour of all the main sights, plus some wine tasting across the river, we returned to the hotel where our bags had already been placed in the room. As others have said, the public areas of the hotel are very grand, in an opulent 19th-century sort of way. The rooms are plain and utilitarian, but ours was quite and had a great bathroom, and was scrupulously clean, so we were happy. Great breakfast was included in our rate; I recommend it if you are a breakfast-lover.
