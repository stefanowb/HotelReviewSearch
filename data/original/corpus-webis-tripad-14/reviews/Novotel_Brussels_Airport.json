I don't ever remember staying at an airport hotel that was THAT quiet. I would have never guessed it was that close to the hotel. I usually wear ear plugs when I sleep at hotels but had no need to here. The furniture was very comfortable and the AC worked great even in November (I like my room cold). The room was rather large, especially for European standards. There is a separate bathtub and shower which I liked.", "title": "Good airport hotel - extremely quiet", "user": "robstrash", "date": "November 16, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 49377206}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled on business", "text": "My flight got in at 9am and they were able to give me a room when I arrived at 9:30 which was wonderful as I laid down and got 2 hours of sleep.
