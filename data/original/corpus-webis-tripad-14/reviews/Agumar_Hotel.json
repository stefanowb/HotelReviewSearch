As we were four people, we booked a family room, with two communicating rooms and one bathroom. The rooms were nice, but had one major drawback: they overlooked Paseo della Reina Cristina, which is a very loud large road leading to Atocha Railway Station. Unfortunately, this road is pretty busy also at night. Therefore, if you are not used to earplugs, you will have problems, as I did. The rooms were pretty spacious and bedding comfortable, but did not provide any complementary facility (coffee, tea making facilities, or free wi-fi).
