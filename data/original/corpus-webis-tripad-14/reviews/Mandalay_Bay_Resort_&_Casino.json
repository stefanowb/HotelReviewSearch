The hotel was a little disappointing. The rooms are stocked with alcohol. The refrigerator is weighted so if anything is removed you are charged. That meant there was no room to place your own items to keep cool. There was no coffee maker in the room. For families on a budget, this could be a challenge since the restaurants are pricey. Our bathroom had a very large black stain on the floor which took away from the appeal of the room. The toilet paper holder kept falling off the wall. On the positive side, the wave pool, lazy river and outdoor resort areas were beautiful. I felt like I was relaxing at the beach instead of being in the middle of the desert.
