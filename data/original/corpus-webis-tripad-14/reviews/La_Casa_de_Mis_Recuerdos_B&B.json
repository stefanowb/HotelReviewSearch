The sanctuary of this B&B is the best. Run by Nora and her family, the breakfast time is a great place to meet the family and other travelers and indulge in the local fruits and pastries as well as the home-cooked dish that changes every day. Nora also changes her tradtional outfit daily as well as the dining tablecloth. It is a feast for the eyes. Pino Suarez is on a rather busy street, but if you are in the back it is quiet and you are serenaded by the birds which over-ride all other sounds. The B&B is well located and Nora or William ( her husband) will find you drivers for outings or you can hire Nora for artisanal village or market tours or cooking classes.

It is simply a wonderful place, beautiful, quiet with a great family running it - and the best breakfasts you could ever hope for. This is a family of fine cooks and each morning started with fresh fruit, sweet breads, and a Mexican main course, tamales with mole negro, or huevos rancheros, tacitos with chicken, everyday something different and delicious.
