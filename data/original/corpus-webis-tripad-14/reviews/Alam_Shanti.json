Monkey forest is at the end of the road and you can walk through to the shops of Ubud, 15 mins or so. Very entertaining and not for the faint hearted!! We loved it though and the monkeys are such characters. We ate at Cafe Wayan in Ubud which is owned by the same family that own Alam Shanti. A beautiful meal in a pretty tranquil setting with great service. They also have a bakery at the entrance to the restaurant. The hotel shuttle will drop you off and also pick you up. We also went to their other restaurant which is walking distance from the hotel, Laka Leke and had another great meal and thoroughly enjoyed the kecak and fire dance show. The grounds at Alam Shanti are well kept and very lush and pretty. We swam every day and twice had lunch by the pool. The food comes from Laka Leke and i am still craving the guacamole and spicy chicken wings! There is complimentary afternoon tea either at your room or by the pool. The staff are fantastic and so helpful but not intrusive. We had a one hour massage at Alam Wangi Spa and also a pedicure. A lovely peaceful experience in a nice environment.
