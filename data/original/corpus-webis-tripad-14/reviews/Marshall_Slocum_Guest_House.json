We stayed in the Captains Quarters', which was beautiful and comfortable, with a nice Jacuzzi whirlpool tub in the bathroom, which sure came in handy after walking the entire Cliff Walk the first day there. The owners, Mark and Dana, were the nicest people and were genuinely concerned with us having a great time while we were there, whether recommending a \"local\" restaurant outside of the tourist area or helping us plan what we wanted to see for the day. Mark is also a gourmet chef, and the breakfasts that he cooked in the morning were a highlight of our day. I would certainly recommend the Inn and Mark and Dana to anyone looking to have a great vacation in Newport, whether looking to spend a nice weekend getaway, or for a relaxing week.
