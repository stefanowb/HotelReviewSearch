The location was excellent, just a minute's walk from the Duomo and only a 10 minute walk from Santa Maria Novella train station. The staff were really helpful and friendly - as soon as we arrived Paolo got a map out and showed us the best places to visit and to eat and he also helped us to find out train times for our trip back to the airport. The breakfast in your room was a nice touch and we appreciated being able to choose the time that it was served (up to 10am) as you want to be able to relax on holiday. The room was clean, the bed was very big and comfy and the bathroom was good with a great shower. The air conditioning worked fine, although the 'off' button seemed to be broken so we had to leave it on all the time, which seemed a bit of a waste. Otherwise, everything was great and made for a wonderful, relaxing holiday.", "title": "Great place, great staff.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Colleen_Mcrae", "date": "September 16, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 5806385}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled as a couple", "text": "We got lost initially when we got of the train but quickly got directions and made our way to our pensione.

Our room was then another flight up the stairs from that. Above us, on what would have been the fourth floor, was another pensione. It is not uncommon in Europe to have your pensione located inside a building with other businesses or other pensiones. If you are staying at a place like this, you want to be clear about how many flights of stairs you will be walking up. We consider ourselves in alright shape and we had booked this room before I had torn my meniscus. My knee held up pretty well even with all the steps. (One thing I have noticed is that overall, generally, Europeans seem to be in much better physical shape than Americans.

The private washroom was very clean but very tiny, you need to maneuver, but not a problem. The air was not on yet but it never got too hot in May and you can open the windows, which when shut was completely soundproof. This is a high tourist location, less than a block from the Duomo and the 2-3 blocks from the Accademia. The best part was the warm breakfast brought to our room every morning with selections of cappuccino/hot chocolate, orange/grapefruit juice, warm/cold milk, hot roll, croissants, crackers, cookies and several jams and nutella. This is a b&b and not a hotel so there is nobody at the reception in the evening.
