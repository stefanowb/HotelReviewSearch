We had a spotlessly clean, very well appointed room with a comfortable bed and a nice big tub in the bathroom. Excellent customer service from beginning to end, and a great \"off the strip\" price. The casino was very nice, with several good restaurants and bars. The best thing was that we didn't have to walk through the casino to get to our room from the hotel entranced or from the pool. The casino is attached, but in a separate area from the guestroom area of the hotel. Only fatal flaw was the very, very loud raucous pool scene. No way to relax and enjoy a quiet swim and sunbathe, as the ambient music is at ear splitting rock concert level throughout the entire pool area. It's all about the twenty-something heavy drinking party crowd here, so kids and older folks may not be comfortable. I took one look and went right back to my room. I later discovered that as a hotel guest, I could use the pool for free at the attached health spa, which was quieter and much more private.

I would definitely recommend this place if you are tired of the strip and want a few night get-away. I would say this is perfect for the parent-getaway weekend.

We come back to the Las Vegas area 3-4 times a year, and I was hopeful this would be our new \"spot\". Um, not so much. The room was comfortable, with a decent view of the pool, but was dusty, with hair on the pillows. The magazines were a month+ out of date. There was a huge party on the deck below our room our last night, and it was impossible to get anyone to answer the phones to let us know how long we could expect the extreme noise to go on (the music was louder than the \"nightclub\" downstairs we had just left). The Concierge leaves by 5:00 pm, so good luck getting reservations for ANYTHING (the front desk refuses to help or offer any suggestions - tells you to come back tomorrow). The Grand Cafe was a complete debacle, which we just avoided altogether after 2 attempts (the staff couldn't be any ruder there). The Cabanas and staff were great, but the general pool/bar staff...not so awesome.
