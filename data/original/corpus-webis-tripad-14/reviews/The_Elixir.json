The rep, Ahmet is excellent at his job and is always popping by the hotel to check all his guests are having a good holiday. We requested the same room as we had last year, room 203, a quiet room if you prefer this. The hotel will be 9 years old next year and whilst it is showing signs of age in the rooms this does not detract from the overall cleanliness and facilities provided. Breakfast is served on the roof terrace and there is a Turkish-style breakfast with the option of cooked eggs and fruit juice each morning. The pool is a lovely quiet area, with plenty of sunbeds, both in the sun and in the shade. Lunch can be taken around the pool and the menu is varied. However, what has drawn us back to the Elixir each time is the friendliness and genuine hospitality of the staff in the hotel, and the lovely people we meet around the bar each year. Savaz, Sami, Sebo, Ali and Bilge all deserve a special mention, but it is Pumpkin (or Sezai) who runs the bar that brings it all together. He is sociable, speaks excellent English and is at the heart of this small hotel. As in previous years, we met lovely fellow travellers during the course of our two weeks. Everyone is so friendly and willing to share recommendations for restaurants and day trips. This is what makes this holiday special. Kalkan is a special place, and the Elixir a special hotel.
