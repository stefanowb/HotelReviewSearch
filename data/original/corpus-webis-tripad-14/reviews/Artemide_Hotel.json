It was easy to locate since we opted to take the train from the airport (14 euros p/p) to termini station to avoid traffic so we can go straight to sight-seeing since we only have three nights in Rome. The hotel isn't necessarily a central location to the most popular sights in Rome but certainly walkable and very close to the metro (if you opt to take the trains which come very frequently ~ 6 min). We walked everywhere just to explore but definitely bring comfy shoes - the cobble stones are tough on both feet & legs! Our room is quite small (the tiniest bathroom I've ever seen) but very nice and that's probably why they gave us complimentary breakfast for our entire stay which is very nice.

Though having been to Rome only this once, I have nothing to compare to. However, I can hardly think I would stay anywhere else upon returning to Rome. Service and amenities were excellent, breakfast was likewise excellent, and the rooftop bar was a wonderful touch as well. Recommendations from hotel staff were quite good, and they tried very hard to be helpful. I am not necessarily in agreement that Artemide is \"centrally located\" as others have commented, and that may be the one small issue we had ... many attractions are not within easy walking distance. But the bellmen are happy to call taxis, and the Republica metro stop is quite close (we had no issues with the metro, other than its limited capabilities). Please know, of course, that you will be paying top dollar for this establishment, particularly these days with the weak dollar. However, it was certainly worth it, and it was a pleasure to come \"home\" each day and night to the Artemide after sightseeing, dining, enjoying Rome, and so on.", "title": "Wonderful hotel in a wonderful city", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Jacqueline A", "date": "September 2, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 117587903}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "This was our first time in Italy. We stayed here and were totally blown away. The customer service is impeccable and go above and beyond what is needed without having to be asked. Months prior to our arrival I had a lot of questions and concerns about our trip in general since it was our first time to Italy. This hotel is in the PERFECT location! In walking distance of EVERYTHING in Rome (except the Vatican, 40 min walk). I was in constant contact with Alessandro who answered everything with detail and certainty. They arranged for a car to pick us up to and from the hotel, taxis to take us places at a moments notice, arrange dinner reservations every night, called to make sure restaurants were open for us, made sure we knew where we were going everyday, gave excellent dining tips, told us where to stay away from, kept checking up on our flight home (hurricane Irene). The hotel rooftop restaurant is DELICIOUS and should not be overlooked. This restaurant has some serious top notch cuisine for a good price tag! They even researched with us (for about 20minutes) how to get to and from the island of Ponza, because my girlfriend and I wanted to travel by ourselves one day instead of with a tour. Rooms were VERY clean and nice size. Free mini bar, buffet breakfast every morning was delicious as well!
