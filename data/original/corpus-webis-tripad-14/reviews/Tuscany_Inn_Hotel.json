This town has a \"billion\" hotels quoting a local and to be true I don't think he's that far off. The Tuscany Inn in a clean and new/modern looking hotel with great service and what I think is a very fair rate (80 euros for us). Room is great but the bed is a little hard and they charge for the internet. Although I think the internet should be free, we've looked in a couple other hotels in town before this one and they had no internet for the same price and they looked alot older.
