There really isn't a traditional hotel lobby here, but the doormen and concierge (in the lobby) were very friendly, kind and helpful. The restaurant, bar and breakfast areas on the 19th floor were superb. I cannot understand the complaints of another reviewer about the seating at the breakfast/lunch area; I thought it was one of the best such areas of the many hotels at which I've stayed. The staff there all served me promptly and politely. The decor in the hallways is a bit overdone, but at least it's not the cookie-cutter industrial look of so many Marriotts, Hyatts, and Hiltons. There are plenty of good hotels within easy walking distance of each other in the heart of Philadelphia. Check prices and book accordingly.
