The room was large and clean with everything you needed plus more. Even though it's above a pub, was actually very quiet as the road is practically a dead end apart from the train station. The highlight was the breakfast. It was a gorgeous morning so we asked to take breakfast in the garden as it was stunning. It was all arranged for us once we'd come back from a walk and it was the best breakfast in a B&B i'd ever had. Everything was spot on, all freshly cooked and no cheap sausages, can't stand a cheap sausage.

I understand they'll be doing more food as they settle into what is a relatively new venture for them. This is a pub with rooms - so if you're looking for a boutique hotel, maybe it's not for you. However, if you're looking for a really well run, welcoming place to stay which is slap in the middle of Lymington and where the staff treat you like you really matter, you won't be disappointed.
