I literally stumbled on this place while planning a trip to Denver, Co to visit our son. My husband had suggested we drive down to view Pikes Peak. I happened to see this place on tripadvisor and became intrigued with the Garden of the Gods. We decided to take a chance and it turned out to be an incredible decision. Actually, we would have loved to have stayed for a few days, some for sight seeing in the nearby area and a couple of days for lingering on the property at the Lodge. The gorgeous suites were roomy, more like an apartment with a lovely terrace, fireplace, sitting area, huge flat screen tv, dressing room with walk in closet, huge bathroom! We enjoyed a delicious dinner, probably the best in the 8 day trip and a hardy breakfast.", "title": "Put This On Your BUCKET List!", "user": "bellalee", "date": "October 25, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 143702197}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I contacted the Lodge directly after reviewing on line and made our over night reservations expaining that we would be driving from the Denver airport. The staff person made my reservations, assisted with directions, made great suggestions regarding route, even advising about the rental car and the toll road charges (huge help), arranged a room upgrade....amazing assistance. After arriving in Denver, getting our rental car...we knew the correct route to take and the route to avoid excessive charges due to the assistance offered by the staffer at the Lodge. The drive was approximately 1.5 hours and so very beautiful. We drove down in the middle of the afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed viewing the countryside. It was a great way to start our trip. We were amazed with the beauty of the terrain in this area of the state of Colorado. As we approached the Lodge at the Garden of the Gods, we were both speechless! Of course, coming from the east coast much more accustomed to the Great Smoky Mountain area, this scenery was mesmerizing. We drove up to the Lodge and entered the lobby continuing to gasp at the absolute astouding beauty of this place. After a smooth check in, we continued on to the room and could not believe how lovely this location was and how lucky we felt to be staying here. I walked through the large room to the terrace which overlooked the \"Kissing Camels\". Again, coming from the east coast, this view was simply stunning! I sat down at the table on our terrace and watched the bunnies scurry around the landscape.
