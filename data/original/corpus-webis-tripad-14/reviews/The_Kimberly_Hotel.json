The management at the hotel must fix 2 things to make us return to the Kimberly, one is the rudeness of the staff must be addressed, you cannot have an attitude if you are in the hospitality industry, second is the only 1 lobby bathroom situation.

How wrong I was! The receptionist never made eye contact with us once during the check in process or provided us with any information about the hotel other than our room number (7H). When making the booking in May, I had requested a King room and stated that we were in NY for a celebration. I was very dissapointed to find that the room we were given had two double beds and the view from our window was the air conditioning units, a massive pile of bricks and directly facing the bedrooms of another hotel (not reflecting any of the images I had seen on their hotel website). On contacting the front desk to tell them I was not happy about the room and pointing out that our booking was made way back in May I was told that the hotel was full and that there were no other rooms available. This indicates that they pay no heed to any special requests so why ask? We reported the noisy and rattling air conditioning which was never fixed and there was constant noise from banging doors when the cleaning staff were servicing the rooms. To sum up; our far from luxurious 3 night stay cost more than $1000 dollars resulted in 3 sleepless nights in a room where we could not open the blinds and we had to sleep in separate beds. Not the romantic end to our wonderful holiday that I had planned! The customer service from the reception staff was non existent (with the exception of the doormen and the bell staff who were all very helpful and kind) as we had similar treatment on asking someone to look at the air conditioning and at checkout.

I bugged the staff quite a bit, especially with issues resulting from the storm, and everyone was gracious and helpful. Not in the thick of things but certainly within moderate walking distance. It irks me to see certain complaints come up with reviews for NYC hotels - \"lousy view\". What were you expecting, a sun-drenched meadow? You don't go to a big city for the view because most likely there is none. Also, a hotel has no control over street noises so....you request a room away from the street, easy.
