My friend and I checked in to the smallest room I have ever seen after being treated quite rudely at the front desk. We arrived early and were handed a key to a small closet in which we could store our bags until check in. The closet was completely packed, and if not for the help of a fellow guest, we would not have been able to stow our bags. Our tiny room didn't even have enough space for our bags, and the french doors that look out to the courtyard had no lock. We promptly upgraded to a larger room, which we of course paid for. With the upgrade, we were to receive a free newspaper of our choice and a bottle of wine or water. The first day, we had neither and had to ask the front desk to ensure we got what we were paying for. The front desk staff were very rude, although the restaurant staff were pleasant. We discovered only by calling for room service on a Sunday night that the restaurant is closed on Sundays, even though the menu card in our room said the restaurant is open daily from 7-10pm. I would never stay at the Ceasar again although it is conveniently located.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "July 16, 2004", "id": 2303423}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "we loved it!", "text": "My husband, mum and I stayed here in June and were panicking after reading the reviews here! However it exceeded our expectations! Ok the rooms are small, but they are immaculate and to be honest what can you expect for such a reasonable pirce in a great location? If you book, ask for a room at the front of the hotel - then you will have a big (opening) window. My mum was in a single at the top of the hotel at the back, and it was hot.

It is quite a bargain and hard to find a decent hotel at the prices they offer. The single rooms are very very (very) small and the room doors do not have double safety locks. The bathrooms are very clean. I have also stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend and the double rooms are equally as miniature as the single rooms. The hotel is in a very quiet area but there is a very lively street nearby with a shopping center and two tube stations. The 4th floor was under construction when I was there (Jan-Feb 05) and they really did a poor job at notifying guests that there would be noise and construction teams in the corridors early in the morning. If you don't plan to spend much time in the hotel room, want to save money and care about cleanliness, I would suggest this hotel. It's small but you get what you pay for.
