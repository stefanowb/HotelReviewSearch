The result is an extremely posh hotel with lovely amenities in a nice part of town. The executive suite on the 16th floor is very nice. It's like having your own big living room equipped with an outdoor deck. The health club on the 5th floor is also good, and the rooms are nice, albeit too dry. My air conditioner was highly suspect, but the rooms are still beautiful. My one criticism would be the restaurants in the hotel. They look very pretty, but don't be fooled -- the food is mediocre at best. Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't know what good food tastes like. I recommend Angus, a restaurant only 100 yards from the hotel. Now Angus is usually surrounded by pimps and girls selling lapdances, but the food is good. And the girls at Angus are hot.

In the area behind the hotel are many shops and cafes, etc. I felt safe here, but watch yourself. As I said, there are pimps and guys looking to sell you something.
