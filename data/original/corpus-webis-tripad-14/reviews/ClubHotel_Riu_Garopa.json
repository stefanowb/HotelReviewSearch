We had a great flight out dispite the other preivous comments we had plenty of room and my husband is 6ft . we had a free complimentary meal on both the outward and inward flight and it went very quick despite the nearly 6 hr flight we didnt notice. The hotel is spotlessly clean aand the staff cant do enough for you, our room was tidied every day for us and anything used was replaced.im a vegetarian and dont eat fish and was worried that i may struggle with what to eat, i need never have worried. There was so much choice i had something different every day and more than enough. my husband is a big fish and meat eater and he had lots of choice. we never found it to busy as other people have commented and plenty of everything what ever time you went for breakfast, lunch and dinner,We went to the African themed restaurant and the santa maria at the funana hotel and food was exellent there to. It really is one large hotel im not sure why they class it as 2 different ones as which ever one you book is exactly the same. The entertainemtn in the evenings isnt the same standard as we expect here but nevertheless the staff and brilliant dancers and try to accomodate all languages and a range of different people in their performances so i applaude them for that. Taxis to the pier in santa maria is only 3 euros if you go behond the hotel barrier as opposed to 4 if they come to the door. There is so much to do we couldnt fitr it in in the week we had and would have loved to have stayed at least 2 more days. we went fishing with fernando as a preious triop advisor had given us the information we needed and he was great, we would feingelty recommend him to any would be fisherman or woman like myself! we went on the jeep safari with thompsons and again not much to see as its very barren land but the salt lakes are well worth a vist . you do get a bit of hassle from the sellers in the streets of santa maria and we are not use to that and didnt like that part of our holkiday and infact the hotel gift shops sell exaclty the same things if not a bigger hoice and we found them much cheaper that bartering thats for sure, my advice dont waste your time just buy some gifts in the hotel and be done with it!!. we have no complaints and would and are definetly going again.", "title": "Anniversary holiday cape verde may 2012", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "weekender052", "date": "May 18, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 130163561}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Think of the moon or Mars and this is what you get when you leave the airport, a barren landscape devoid of life, the whole area is a giant building site very reminiceint of Spain in the 80's. But get to the hotel and it is a different world the gardens (which are still a work in progress) are green and lush, the hotel itself is clean and when driving up to it is quite impressive it reminded me of something from Arabian Nights. The rooms themselves are clean but basic, they would benefit from a makeover. The food wasn't brilliant but it wasn't bad either, it did depend on what time you went for dinner. There was quite a range of different foods catering for all tastes so even the fussiest of eaters wouldn't starve. The staff all worked hard and tried to help when asked overall if you get a good deal then it will be value for money but if brochure prices are paid then you will be disappointed. One other thing the reps are very good and are always available if you need them but don't buy the catamaran trip it costs 49 euros each and is rubbish and not worth it for only 3 hours out of the hotel.", "title": "not bad", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Blueboy1967", "date": "May 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 130131808}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "I have rated the value high because what I paid for 1 week it was good value for money.", "title": "Good to chill out", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "brian_in_Bournemouth", "date": "May 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130101392}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled solo", "text": "Went April 2012", "title": "Exactly what I expected", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "hiddentalent", "date": "May 17, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130089259}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012", "text": "Firstly remember 5 star isnt 5 star but saying thay its as good as any other european 5 star.", "title": "Good early season holiday", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "britabroad5161", "date": "May 23, 2012", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 130478463}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Flight - paid for extra leg room so no problems also had free food, have to pay for drinks though.", "title": "Riu Garopa Sal", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "LaserN", "date": "May 22, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 130386188}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Hotel - clean, linked to the funana so its a big complex so you get a map or you still get lost like we did!", "title": "Poor view from balcony - trees - no sign of the sea!!!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "footmananglia", "date": "May 21, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 130343425}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "Food - plentiful like most all inclusive its the same but u get what u pay for.

The Hotel check in takes a while queing up to check in, but it only takes one person to queue until you reach the issuing of the All Inc. wrist band. The Hotel, rooms and gardens are spottless, the Buffet food was constantly refreshed in the main Resturants, you can also use the resturants in the twin hotel so there are six to choose from, four of them must be pre booked for evening meals at the reception. The Wines, soft drinks (coke, fanta etc..) draught lager [Strella], teas and coffees are also self service available. The Pool bar serve 'very popular Cocktails (not too many people over lubricated) and the beach bar serves soft drinks and lager. we booked a last minute flight to another island (Fogo) that was a great daytrip, but we would consider hunting around the Santa Mario travel agents for better deals to the other islands next time. We was so satisfied with the Hotel that we didnt find time to venture into Santa Maria much but it is worth the 3 Euro taxi fare to the Jetty to watch the days catch come in, then walk the beach back to the resort (or the cobbled broadwalk). there are some africa touts in Santa Maria that try to get you into their shops by claiming a festival or a factory shop outlet etc... (almost all the souvenirs are imported from Africa) i wish they would realise that if they didnt try to badger you into the shops they would get more customers, on contrast the Cape verde owned shops are a joy to wander around. the touts outside the beach gate are okay and can be a laugh, if you dont want the island tour or fishing trip etc..just tell them you not interested. The sea is great when (only one red flag day when we was there) you get used to the the breaking waves. the beach is a good place to learn kite and wind surfing (if you can drag yourself away from the free sun loungers and shades) we also noticed a lot of scuba diving. The breeze cools you down enough not to notice sunburn so use a higher factor than normal not to get burnt, we took Mozi spray but didnt see any but the plug in insect repeallant worked. The bar areas run out of seating after dinner so try the coloured grogue in the Barracuda Bar, you will soon be up dancing. we caught the end of the main entertainment by the Animation team a few times, that looked lively.
