You can't get to much more centralized than where this hotel is located. It's about a 5min walk to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain was only 15min walk, Pantheon about 10-15min walk, the Colosseum was about 25 min walk, Basilica of Saint Peter was about 30mins, and many, many other spectacular historical sights with in 20min walk (give or take 5mins). The maid service was impeccable. When you leave your hotel room, you drop your room key off at the front desk. When you come back, your bed is always made, even if you took a mid day nap. Their continental breakfast was exceptional. Nothing like you find in the states. If you aren't pleased with their breakfast, then the problem is not with them, but with you. You can get eggs to order, cappuccinos, lattes, American coffee with cream, and a few other items at no additional cost during breakfast hours (7am to 10:30am if I remember correctly). There are dozens of great restaurants near by, all within easy walking distance. They hotel staff can recommend some great restaurants in the near by area as well. The hotel is extremely close (1 block) from the nearest metro station so if you plan to go a little further away from the hotel or aren't able to walk great distances, just hop the metro. They have bus stops right around the corner as well. The room was perfect for our needs. Air conditioned, mini fridge, complimentary fruit on the desk, shower, hair dryer, heated towel rack, comfy bed, ample plugins for our camera batteries, computers, etc. They have a small 17in TV in the room, a safe, and wall locker for your hanging cloths. Can't ask for much more. Upon your arrival they will provide you with a complimentary map of the area showing you all the hot spots to visit. Ask them about restaurants, and they'll mark those on the map for you as well.
