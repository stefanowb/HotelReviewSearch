It is a five minute (downhill) stroll away. Our room was in the main block, so I have no experience of accommodation in any other part of the hotel. However, the room wasn\u2019t without problems. The air-conditioning could be temperature controlled but the fan was either \u2018full-on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019. Therefore it was a very noisy. This was a shame as the hotel is located in a quiet spot. Apart from that, the room was decorated in a modern contemporary style. It was well equipped, with a Jacuzzi shower, safe, satellite TV and a mini bar, complete with some complimentary soda and water. The desk staff were efficient, spoke English and always wore a smile. The dining room staff were also very friendly and efficient. We did not have dinner at the hotel, (Sperlonga is bursting with good restaurants) but breakfast, (IMHO) was WAY above the Italian norm. A choice of American (weaker) coffee, or if you preferred, espresso or Cappuccino (also free). Decent juices, fresh fruit salad, breads, pastries, (including donuts), yoghurts, preserves as well as the usual selections of cheese, salamis and mortadella. My wife and I spent a week here following a week in Rome, where the breakfast was more (cough) \u2018typically Italian\u2019. I would not dispute the fact that if the beach is your priority, then the Aurora would SEEM a better bet but as I have not stayed there, that is pure speculation. If you are not a beach person, then I can recommend the Virgilio. It isn\u2019t perfect but IMHO, it does what it says on the tin with a degree of style, aplomb and panache. I also think it good value for money. Then again, I live in London, where breathtakingly steep prices seem to be the norm.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Litzy", "date": "March 22, 2006", "id": 4723683}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2005", "text": "I really cannot fault the Virgilio Grand.
