The staff and owner Geoff are quite accomodating. If this is your first trip to Cartagena it is perfect because it is located in Centro near everything. You can walk to restaurants, markets, etc. If you are a late or light sleeper try to get a room on the 2 or third floor because the breakfast area is located outside the rooms. The beds are very firm as well which I found slightly uncomfortable. Most of the guests that visit tend to be English speaking. Geoff , who is from the UK and his manager Monica both speak English. The AC works great being it is very hot in Cartagena and the mini fridge is great to keep extra water, beer etc. The staff will organize tours for you as well. What else can you ask for? I highly recommend this gem in the heart of the city.

However we decided to break our eight day stay by spending three nights at their beach house. We wanted a complete escape from the hustle and bustle of downtown Cartagena and needed to relax . Wow, this beach house was something else- fully catered, beautifully prepared and furnished and set in quite remarkable tropical surroundings. Like the hotel it also had free internet and satelliteTV/ comms. It's not advertised on their webpage so you need to ask for the details and book in advance.

The owners, Geoff and Carmen, did a beautiful job restoring the property. The rooms are very comfortable -- ours was on the top floor and the ceiling must've been 20 feet high -- and the bathrooms are modern. There is a rooftop pool area that, while small, was never crowded. The first floor atrium is a pleasant place for breakfast. The food was simple but authentic and quite good. The staff is absolutely wonderful. And the hotel is in a terrific spot -- centrally located such that you're a 10-minute walk from just about anywhere within the walls, but comfortably removed from the most heavily trafficked plazas. Many of the city's best restaurants are within a couple of blocks (it seems they've clustered there because the Sofitel is nearby.)", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "June 25, 2006", "id": 5380778}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed in Casa la Fe for four days with our daughter and her friend., and so we took two rooms.
