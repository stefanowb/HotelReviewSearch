As usual with Premier Inn, reception was helpful and the room was comfortable, modern and a good size. We left too early for breakfast. My only complaint is that the room was too hot (one of our few warm days this summer) and the heating controls could only warm the room and not act as air conditioners. Is it asking too much to have functioning aircon in the rooms? Otherwise a pleasant enough stopover and reasonable value at \u00a372 for the room.", "title": "Good overnight stop on way to Channel Tunnel", "user": "ChrisRugby", "date": "September 5, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139453193}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Very easy to find, parking ample and the restaurant which we used for both dinner and breatfast was excellent.

I stay in quite a few Premier Inns and they are all much better than this. The particular beef I have is the lack of air con. On a summers night the room temperature is just about unbearable. If Premier Inn genuinely want me to have a good night\u2019s sleep then air con for this hotel is a must. Perhaps I should have invoked the good nights guarantee clause to get my money back. Not sure what other hotels are in Folkestone but will certainly look next time.

The receptionist was really friendly and helpful. we went for the \u00a322 meal deal which was 3 course dinner and 1 drink and breakfast at Table Table (Brickfield arms). It was busy and we hadn't booked a table but the staff were really friendly and didn't have to wait long.

It is easy to find and very close to the M20. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. The hotel was fully booked and one staff member was going out of her way to ring round and try and find a tired traveller a room in another hotel, which impressed us. She went beyond the call of duty. My husband also left his phone in the room. We realised after leaving, rang them on my phone and they immediately sent someone to check under the bed and behind the settee. They rang me back within 10 minutes to say they had found it and we were able to return and collect it. The room itself was very clean, the water hot, the bed comfortable with a choice of pillows, and there was one of the new flat screen TVs that Premier Inn are fitting in all their hotels. if it hadn't been for next door's alarm clock we would have had a very good nights sleep. For us this was just a stopover after arriving on an evening ferry from France, and we would stay here again if travelling cross channel. We did not try the restuarant.
