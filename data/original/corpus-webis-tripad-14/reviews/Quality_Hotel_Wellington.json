The hotel is located in a busy and vibrant part of the city and within walking distance of many excellent restaurants, bars and shops. On site covered parking was only an extra $10, and as we had booked using the Wotif website, we also received a continental breakfast voucher. My only concern was that the after hours entry at the rear of the building was down a dark alley... it was safe but I think better lighting would've made a big difference to my feeling of security.", "title": "Spacious and Modern", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Angelco", "date": "January 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "front_desk": 3.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 12453308, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Very modern", "disliked": "\u2014 After hours entry"}}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled with family", "text": "The location of this hotel was excellent.
