Unfortunately it was not for us though. We were after a little touch of elegance for our trip away but with this came a load of people that really wanted to keep to themselves by the pool all day. Not the friendly atmosphere of some of the other Phuket locations. We found that it was a battle to get a seat by the pool as early as 10 and for the rest of the day. We found ourselves looking to move down to Patong on the second day. Arrival greeting was fantastic with a face towel and drink but service dropped off after that. It deserves it's price for facilities but everything in the facilities seems to follow the expensive trend. Our room was next to construction which started early and finished late. Understandable with the events of a couple of years ago but Surin beach was not affected. No sleep the whole time we were there. Something we found great was the red tablecloth restaurant down on Surin beach for a sunset dinner. The banana or pineapple pancakes in the morning are also fab. There is also a great bar/restaurant owned by a English guy called Terry about five doors down. Overall our, and i stress \"our\", opinion was not to high of this place. It is a drive from anywhere and fair enough if that is what you want..", "title": "Great location but not for us.", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "Jase_n_Polly", "date": "October 25, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 6009101, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Cleanliness, quiet location", "disliked": "\u2014 Atmosphere"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2006, traveled with family", "text": "I'm actually writing this review from my laptop, comfortably perched on a chaise in the lobby of the TwinPalm, thanks to thge complimentary free wireless internet access.

We ate dinners outside the hotel -- casual meals on the beach for an obscenely little amount of money, and one very nice dinner at the upscale Silk on the main street -- within walking distance or a cheap 100 bhat cab ride away (in fact, on the way home, we were taken back to the hotel free of charge, a service provided by the restaurant and I'd guess if you'd made a reservation they'd pick you up too).", "title": "Perfect hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "thai_phuket", "date": "October 15, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 4.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 5956916, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 the beautiful room"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wow!
