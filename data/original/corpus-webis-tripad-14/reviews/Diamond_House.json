I can't recommend this hotel enough. It's nicely located (about 5 mins from Kao San Road) and is quite central. The rooms are tastefully decorated. i suppose you could almost class it as a \"boutique hotel.\" The rooms were clean, there are also safes in each room. Check out the knobs for the taps in the bathroom. You'll see what i mean!! The staff were fantastic, extremely polite, helpful and welcoming. The food was nice witha nice area in the lobby where you eat. There was also internet access in the lobby, five fairly good speed computers. Overall this is a good hotel.
