When I booked I was told the only room left was a 'small double'. Although the room was small, many other hotels would have it as there standard size. The welcome from the staff was great and the service was second-to-none. We has dinner in the pub downstairs which was the best pub food I have ever had. The bed was very comfy. The room and bathroom were completely spotless. The breakfast was better than most 4* hotels (cereals etc as well as a choice of full English, scrambled eggs with salmon etc, with freshly brewed coffee). The total bill for the room, 4 pints, 2x main courses, 1x dessert, and a fantastic breakfast was \u00a38!. The only tiny downside is that the village it is in is in not as pretty as some of the others villages on the Moor but its in the heart of everything so easy to travel around.", "title": "Fantastic Place.

We had stayed there six years previously when the Landlord first took over the Hotel. I forgot in those six years how relaxing a stay at The Duke of Wellington could be. The service was excellent and the room spotlessly clean and comfortable. We ate in the restaurant on Valentine's night and, like the last time, the food was superb. The menu was varied and offered food at a range of prices. On both occasions we have stayed at the Duke of Wellington, we have found Grant, the Landlord, and the village locals to be extremely friendly and welcoming. There are spectacular views of the village and what was just one overnight stay felt like we had been away for days - so relaxing. We will not hesitate to stay again and I hope that my partner repeats this surprise!", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "February 17, 2006", "id": 4466011}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Mini Honeymoon", "text": "Very nice location - very quiet village - great for getting to Whitby. The meals were overpriced but we ate out at Whitby and only used the Inn for sleeping, relaxing and Breakfast. It was a short but pleasant stay for a few days after our wedding - and was better than our honeymoon in Jamaica (Be advised - avoid Riu tropical Bay in Jamaica). Wellington Inn was a nice place to spend quality time. You can come and go as you please and its great to have a Bar just a few seconds from your room.

The landlord did all the cooking and only entered the bar late at night, he never once introduced himself to us or any other of his guests. The price of \u00a333 per person per night for B&B was well out of context, it was a comfortable standard room,nothing more. The meals too were well overpriced - \u00a38.95 for haddock and chips and Cumberland sausage(which actually was 1 long sausage like you get from the chippy). Each guest was only allowed to order food at 15 minute intervals as the chef(Landlord) \"Could only cook one meal at a time!!\", his staff told us. After 2 nights here, I became ill and we had to leave early, this was when we met the Landlord personally. He was absolutly uninterested in our reasons for needing to leave early and make a huge show of tying his shoelaces all the time we were talking to him. We ended up paying a \u00a320 cancellation fee for not staying the third night, and I can truly say, I have never met such an arrogant, impersonable host in all my time of staying in any type of accomodation - small B&B to large Hotel. So, if you want a comfortable, overpriced room,expensive pub grub, a pub without any atmostphere and a totally impersonal experience - Visit the Duke of Wellington at Danby!!!", "helpfulness": 19, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "October 24, 2005", "id": 4046948}], "location": {"country": "United Kingdom (UK)", "continent": "Europe"}, "variance": {"poor": 8, "average": 9, "very good": 21, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 44}, "aka": "Duke Of Wellington Hotel Danby", "slim_ranking": 0.666666666667}
