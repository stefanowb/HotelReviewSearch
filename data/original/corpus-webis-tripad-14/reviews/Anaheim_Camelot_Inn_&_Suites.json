The rooms were very clean and the maid service did a great job daily. The hotel desk staff were kind & courteous and helped us get transportation over to Medieval Times & Knotts Berry. (A taxi to these places is $20.00 one way, not bad). The pool & jaquzzi are small but clean and felt good even in December. My nephew loved the pool! Our stay at this hotel was really great. They could use some different pillows but when I asked for a few more, it was no problem. Do not hestiate to stay here! Location is great too. I have stayed at the Best Western Park Place and the Carousel Inn and this hotel is the best! The breakfast in the morning is basic but filling.
