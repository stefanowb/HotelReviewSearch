As part of the activities package there was whiskey tasting in the whiskey bar. Very informative and got us tipsy before dinner. Boat House is a short wander from the hotel so staff drove us down and picked us back up. Boat house is quite relaxed,we got ribs and pizzas. great meal and great service then headed back to the hotel and had a few drinks in Great Scots Bar. We were picked up at the hotel to go quad biking as our activity which was loads of fun. On our first morning we got breakfast in bed but the second we went down for breakfast and the selection was huge. Both myself and my partner absolutely loved it, best hotel we've ever stayed in, service is amazing and nothing is a hassle. Next time we're going to make sure we visit the spa and bring our swimming costumes. Perfect hotel, couldn't fault anything with it and will definitely visit again.", "title": "Amazing location, great staff and room....", "user": "ngeddie1602", "date": "July 20, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 134934078}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "As expected great hotel, well designed and staffed with employees who care and are clearly well trained.
