We requested a room with a king size bed. They only a few of those, the rest are double beds....way too small. Anyway, our room was on the 6th floor on the street side of the hotel. It was so noisy with traffic and passersby that we couldn't go to sleep. We both wondered if we would sleep at all. Well, after 2 hours of noise, I got up and packed to leave this room. We called and asked for a room on the backside of the hotel. It was only after we got down to the lobby all packed, that they changed our room. It was much more quick, but old and dirty and only had 2 double beds. There was mold in the shower and the tile looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. I was scared of the carpet too. There was still wrappers from the previous guests left in the floor.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ljthumper", "date": "April 24, 2006", "id": 5003165}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Loved the hotel", "text": "Everything about this hotel is old.

It's located right on bathhouse row and you can get out and walk to the stores and resturants. The price is very reasonable and the baths are located on the premises. You don't have to go someplace else to get the baths. The young ladies that do the baths are great. For the price you can not beat it.", "title": "Good hotel.

The prices are unreasonable and the hotel is nasty. The rooms are way out dated. I think the owners need to put some money back into this hotel because apparently they dont. The pillows are plastic covered and the beds are all full size. What hotel these days has only full size beds none that I know of. My husband and I had to squeeze into a full size bed., The worst night of slept in my life!!!!! The TV didn't work half the time and had to have been made back when dinosaurs roamed the earth. The decks where dirty and slanted forward which made it very difficult to stand out there. They still have actually keys to get into the room which worries me as previous people could have a key still to that room. Also to prove that this is a CHEAPLY kept hotel, they ask you to put a sign on your bed if you want you bed linens changed everyday. If you don't put the sign on the bed it doesn't get changed. Same with the towels if you leave them on the sink then they won't give you new ones as they tell you to leave on the floor for new towels. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.", "title": "Do Not Stay Here!!!

We could walk downtown and shop, go on tours, and view the old bath houses. I read the guys review about the broken window and he must have made someone very mad to do that. There is NO way that you can throw a beer bottle and hit a car from either side of the hotel. It must have been a freak accident.
