Well, this Hyatt Regency is a decent hotel. The lobby is large and open and my room was fairly decent, a somewhat modern styling, but not super impressive. The rooms & hotel were overall quite clean. I got a really good deal through hotwire.com and the price was so hard to beat I really shouldn't complain, but I'm basing this review on the fact that they market themselves as a 4-star hotel.

They put us right next to the elevator so all we heard was dinging all night not to mention doors slamming all night oh and had to have security called at 4AM due to a party in the room next door. The next morning, 2 hours before checkout housekeeping walked into our room with barely any knock (I didnt hear anything) and my fiance and I were barely dressed. I did complain to the front desk clerk and he was gracious enough to refund the vallet fee. However when I tried to leave with my car the girl in the vallet booth harrassed me that I didnt pay.

Only one plug outside bathroom that worked to charge my cell phone. Bathroom has a glass shelf which made it difficult to put my toiletries up on. Not much room. Don't bother with the hairdryer for much power. Bring your own. Positives included alot of lights in the room. Fluffy luxury towels. Love the soft cottonelle toilet paper and the kleenex tissues.
