As others before me have noted, the Director is a charming, spirited man who unfortunately seems to have no head for the practicalities of the job. We went along on an adventure, and I was seriously hurt...in fact, I was almost killed. I'm not a baby, and I am used to a certain level of risk while out in the wild. However, I would have liked more emergency preparation, such as a full first aid kit at the ready.
