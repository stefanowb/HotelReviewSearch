I'm a Marriott Gold member. We stayed on points and had a fabulous time! We were upgraded to a garden/partial ocean view with a balcony. The room was a really good size for Europe. The entire staff was excellent and went above and beyond, making dinner recommendations, reservations, calls, etc. Upon check in, a staff member knocked at the door with free bottled water and a small plate of treats. During our stay, they greated us by name, let us know when we received calls from the states, etc. I can't give the staff enough praise! The breakfast in the morning on the terrace was delicious. With stunning views...it was a great way to start the day. The orange juice was beyond delicious. We used the rooftop jacuzzi and lounged on the chairs. The rooftop view of the beach and the Croisette were awesome. The hotel had a magnificent lobby. I'm surprised more people didn't hang out in the lobby to drink and chat. It's definitely a nice gathering space...but was always quiet. The bathroom in our room was wonderful. There was a deep, luxurious tub on one side of the bathroom. It had a device that would let you choose one of three options: use a hand held shower wand, fill the tub with water or use a rain head shower in the back of the tub. On the other side of the bathroom, there's and a traditional shower with a sliding door, also with a rain head. Two showers at once...that made getting ready for dinner a lot faster. :) Great water pressure that made you want to linger. Wonderful robes and slippers.
