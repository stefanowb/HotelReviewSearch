Mostly we stay at Harvey's - Though we noticed a decline in the hotel/casino since Harrah's purchased this hotel. This visit was much better than previous years. We arrived after midnight Friday night (as we advised during our orig reservation and called again that day to remind them). We were told they overbooked by 90 rooms and advised us they would put us ap at Embassy Suites across the street for no charge and credit our room for the first night. (Previous years when overbooked, they would offer us Holiday Inn or other motel farther down the road). We weren't really thrilled or happy about it, why get upset and ruin our weekend. We were tired and just wanted to sleep. They promised us an early checkin back at Harveys as well as a non smoking room. They offered to take all our luggage to ES at once and did so promptly. In the morning, we called the bell service at Harveys, advised them we needed someone to get our luggage at ES and take to Harveys, they arrived within minutes and took our luggage to our room at Harveys. The people at checkin were wonderful, they even gave us a Lake Tower room with a gorgeous view of the lake on the 15th floor (we paid for the lower inexpensive floor). the room was very clean, normally when we return home, our unused clothes smell of smoke - but that was not the case this time. The bed was a uncomfortable and could stand for replacing with some really good mattresses. The Sports Room charged us for drinks and waters while we were betting and watching a Baseball Game- the waitress said they charge after 6pm- the group of young guys next to us were extremely upset- we just didn't order anything further. The Hard Rock Cafe Bar charged us 3 different prices for the exact same drinks (all in a single night). Noone could actually give us a good explanation as to why? One bartender that charged us the most, didn't give us change from our 2 drink order- thinking he was being tipped $4 for 2 drinks.... My husband put him straight then didn't tip him at all.(Normally we tip $1 per drink) Once we found out drinks were cheaper than what he was charging, my husband was not at all happy (that bartender was gone for night). All in all, we found Harveys was better than it has been last 2-3 years but not up to what it was before buyout. We will return again next year and hope things continue to get better.", "title": "Nice Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "specialangel", "date": "June 12, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 16880039, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 View, Service from Front Desk/Maid Service/Valet/Bell Serv", "disliked": "\u2014 Beds"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2008, traveled on business", "text": "Good location, brand new renovations, nice decorations.

Our room was right next to the elevator, but there was never a problem with noise from the elevator traffic. We ate at Hard Rock (Harvey's) and Cabo Wabo (Harrah's). Both were excellent. There is also a Starbucks and Cinnabon...YUM!! Our only complaints are that the walls were very thin (we could hear our neighbors until about 2am) and there is a $10 per person charge to use the gym (we checked the gym out and there wasn't anything special to justify paying this amount). There is a $10.95 charge for wi-fi access in your room. Harvey's is in walking distance to many great activities. The hotel has a tunnel connecting Harvey's to Harrah's.

So of course we gratefully accepted it. We stayed in a luxury room on the 12th floor. The room looked old, but it appeared clean and was very spacious. It had a nice view of the lake and a sitting area where you could enjoy the view. The bathroom had 3 separate areas: A tub and shower area, toilet, and vanity area. They all could be separated by doors so it is great if you have a few people getting ready at the same time. The bed was not comfortable at all. It was too soft. Overall, I can't complain about the room since it was free. I would stay again if I got a deal for less that $100 per night for that room. Harvey's Casino had decent gambling and it is connected to Harrahs, so it is easy to go through the underground passageway to check it out. The one thing that I did not like about Harvey's was the restaurants. We tried their coffee shop, (Choices, I think it was called.) They advertised it as if it were a place that you could get healthy options, but we did not see any on the menu. The food was terrible, and it was just your basic breakfast which should not be hard to mess up in my opinion. We also tried the steakhouse, and we were very disappointed. The server was rude, the food took forever, it was not very tasty, and it was very expensive. We had better meals for much less at Josh's Steakhouse in the Horizon Casino and also in the nice restaurant on the 19th? floor of Harrah's. (Try the breakfast there. Beautiful view and interesting menu items.)

She said just because we requested a non-smoking room that was no guarantee we would get one. I asked to speak to the manager. She went inside a door to the back office. She came back 10 minutes later and said the manager was out. She did not suggest checking back the next day to see if anything came up. She couldn\u2019t care less. I noticed there was a steady stream of guests checking in after us and they were not being assigned the smoking floors but we were too tired to kick up a fuss at that point. I did manage to talk to a manager the next day and she told me: \u201cThis hotel is run by the players.
