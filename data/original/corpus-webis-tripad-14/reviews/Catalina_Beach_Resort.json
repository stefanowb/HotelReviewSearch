If you like big resorts with fancy buffets, then go to Ixtapa instead. When you go to a great fishing village like Zihua, the Catalina is the place you want to stay. My girlfriend and I checked in four four nights on July 31st. I would say, if you stay here, book a Linda Vista suite. There were a few reviews complaining about the darkness of the rooms or the potential possibility of being robbed. I don't know about the decor in some of the rooms, but this place was as safe as can be. Our room had an amazing balcony, with a hammock, a loveseat, and two chaise lounge chairs. The room was clean, and well air conditioned. The bathrooms were clean and the showers were big, and tiled. The toilets work like toilets at home. The staff was friendly and helpful. The beach bar was great, and the sunset bar was nice. As for the stairs; yeah there's a lot of them. But it's give and take when you're downing beer and tacos. It's just fine if you don't have any physical conditions. The town is great. If you want a great meal, just hit up the Antojito joints in town. If you have to have a nice restaurant experience, the Kau-Kan right down the hill from the Catalina is nice. It has an outdoor deck and a beautiful view. The people of the city are great. The taxi cab drivers are friendly. I wouldnt even reccomend wasting time going into Ixtapa. It's clunky and touristy, and filled with Americans. If Senor Frogs or Carlos and Charlie's is your thing, then go for it. Otherwise, stick in town. Walk the streets with an Indio or a Mantejo in your hand. La Ropa is a little bit crowded if you want to lay in the sun, so go over to where the boats come in in El Centro. Walk the streets. The walk into El Centro isn't that bad.
