Pool area nice, although towards the end of our stay it was edging towards the 'set your alarm for a sunbed' scenario! Food was fantastic, even for a fussy vegetarian like me, lots of choice and too many gorgeous puddings and cakes! Lots of choice at the bar for All Inclusive, worked our way down the huge cocktail list, bar staff really nice and efficient, Dimitri who serves round the pool bringing your drinks to the sunbed was very funny and couldn't do enough for you.
