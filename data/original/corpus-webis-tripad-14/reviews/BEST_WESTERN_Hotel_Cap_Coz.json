The Mona Lisa is a modern and welcoming hotel fronting directly onto a beautiful white beach with views across to Concarneau in one direction and the little port of Beg Meil in the other. Nearly all the other guests were French which ensured that the quality of the restaurant was superb and prices reasonable. We were pleased to have paid 10 euros a night extra for a balcony room fully equipped with table, chairs and loungers, a perfect place to sip wine and admire the beautiful views. We drove into the pretty village of Fouesnant for breakfast thinking that 11 euros was too much at the hotel but soon discovered that the current exchange rate results in these high prices everywhere, a small downside to our otherwise lovely and relaxing trip.", "title": "Lulled to sleep by the gentle sound of the sea", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Snapshot", "date": "September 25, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 44376770}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "After visiting the lovely area of Quimper, we arrived at our Mona Lisa Hotel..The lady at check in very profesional told us that we had been upgraded to a front room with ocean view.
