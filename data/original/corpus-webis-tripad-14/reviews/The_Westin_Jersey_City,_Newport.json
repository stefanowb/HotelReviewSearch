It lived up to the Westin brand and is brand new(open Mar 09). Great room, HD Tv, Heavenly Bed and Shower, quiet, pool, jacuzzi, fitness room, on-site restaurants. There is a small shopping mall right next door. Now here's the real plus for this hotel. The price is very good for a Big Name Brand because it isn't in NYC. But don't let that stop you. There is a PATH station within a block that will take you to lower Manhattan to Herald Square in about 15 minutes. From there you can connct to the New York subway/metro system. PATH runs 24/7 with reduced times on weekend nights/early morning(and did I see some characters during the early morning). Also, you can use NJ Transit/Long Island RR with PATH to get to this hotel really cheap, like about half of a shuttle and 70% of a taxi. Plus there's a NJ Light Rail station within a five minute walk that can take you various points along the Jersey side of the Hudson River. On top of that, Starwood currently offers a great military rate for this hotel. The only complaint I have is the internet isn't free. Why can't these \"luxury\" brands at least provide that seeing as lesser places make it part of the room?", "title": "What Can I Say...It's a Westin?", "user": "LyketoGolf", "date": "June 16, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 32488101}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled on business", "text": "As an airline crewmember I stay in various hotels around the globe and always see which hotels really care.", "title": "Home away from home, too", "user": "watchhans", "date": "August 1, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 36409108}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This one definitely does.", "title": "Agree with other recent reviewers", "user": "kapa12345", "date": "July 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35917005}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Clean and spacious rooms, bathrooms are equipped with double shower-heads, one can be turned off to save water.", "title": "My home away from home!", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jc63Stockholm", "date": "July 19, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 35188095}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Large flat-screen tv's with some channels in HD.", "title": "Great location, very clean and good value", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "boomerNC", "date": "July 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34855489}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2009, traveled with family", "text": "Food in the hotel very good although a bit pricey but there are plenty of other options within walking distance.", "title": "We were treated like Royalty!", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "ShanFam", "date": "July 15, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 34846829}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2009, traveled with family", "text": "We picked this hotel for our 6 night stay (or rather, Priceline picked it for us) based on cost.

And the rooms are undeniably comfortable. But beneath that surface sheen, this is a hotel running on automatic pilot. When my room A/C fan would only run on high (too noisy for sleeping), the front desk dispatched an engineer, who fiddled with the digital panel, only to admit that, yes, this particular room's fan only seemed to run on high. He had no solution. So I had to turn off the A/C to sleep. When I used the lobby breakfast area, overly attentive servers kept swooping over to refill my coffee from carafes that dispensed coffee that wasn't nearly as hot as the main container only a few feet away. During the second 24 hours, the wireless connection was so slow, it took 1-3 minutes for a page to load. When I checked out, it took 45 minutes for the hotel to find a taxi, in the business heart of Jersey City on a relaxed Sunday morning, so I missed an earlier train I'd otherwise have caught, even as taxis whizzed by on the main boulevard. (And the vehicle they found, a private limo which I hadn't requested, cost me $15 more.) Though hotel employees always sprang into action, no one seemed particularly concerned if the service wasn't effective. Despite the showy attentiveness, this hotel feels oddly impersonal, as if it were a public relations exercise rather than an actual hotel.
