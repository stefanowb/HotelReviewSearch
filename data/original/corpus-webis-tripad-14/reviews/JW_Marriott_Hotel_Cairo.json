The hotel its really nice. Front desk crew excellent treatment besided when we booked a car ( BMW750) with some company that was next to the front desk the treatment was terrbile, they didnt care about tourism and they told us that in the face, besides they increased us the price when we decided to take it. somebody should do something about this. Anyway, great restaurants you can choose whatever you like and the conference room were pretty ok.My room was perfect, clean and with view to the golf yard,Room service was fast. dont forget to TIP its always good to increase service. Overall excellent hotel, just 15 minutes from the airport but far away from the city center.

On each occasion I found the experience a little overwhelming. The hotel is huge and labrynthine and decorated in a rather over the top way - Napoleon meets Harrods. Having said that the staff are outstanding - polite and welcoming in the Egyptian way. The rooms are comfortable with good broadband access. Good laundry service and the beds are comfortable. There is a wide choice of restaurants and the ones I tried were good (Italian and Steak bar). If you want something more middle eastern there is a Lebanese restaurant which looked good but I was with colleagues and clients so ended up where I did. The leisure facilities are outstanding - pools, massages, gyms etc. Great bar staff too. If you are going into Cairo for Pyramid trips etc. be prepared for a drive as the hotel is located in \"New Cairo\".
