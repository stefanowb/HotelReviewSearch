First of all, it's very difficult to find - I had to call the front desk twice to find the place. The front desk staff was pretty disinterested - they didn't seem to care about their guests or their property. And they coulnd't figure out how to check me out when I left. The rooms have been beautifully redecorated, but ... The room felt damp and musty my entire stay - even with the air-conditioning on. The towels were damp and I wasn't sure the sheets were really clean. They were damp and icky, too. The breakfast was mediocre and the wake-up call I requested never came. When I complained to Hilton corporate (customer satisfaction surveys apparently having been discontinued), they were relatively responsive. But, then they e-mailed me to say that hotel had said it had contacted me directly, which was not true. I travel a good deal on business and usually look to stay at Hampton given their consistency, but I'll avoid this property in the future.", "title": "There are better choices", "user": "ItchyFeetBTS", "date": "November 22, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 3.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 2.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 49839741}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2008, traveled on business", "text": "I have stayed at this Hampton Inn 3 times in the last 2 years and have had no problems what so ever.
