From the minute we walked in our room we thought it was perfect. Clean, spacious, modern and beautifully decorated. My favorite part was the balcony with a fantastic view to the ocean. Each unit looks out onto the Atlantic but some look they are blocked a little by trees growing in the garden. The private pool and sandy pier area adjoining the private docking area are wonderful too. Good price too. Snappers restaurant is right next door, which is excellent, but do expect some nightlife noise, but it really wasn't bad at all. They have fantastic Key Lime Pie! Key Largo in general was fantastic, I would definetly return. It was quiet (no spring breakers!), had the best restaurants I went to in the Keys and many opportunities to snorkel, fish, and any water sport you can imagine. I would highly recommend sunsets at Marker 88 restaurant - great food and fantastic location, our table was five feet from the Gulf! Tower of Pizza for lunch is fun. Bahia Honda State Park was wonderful. I can see why it made the list of best beaches in the USA. Just know what to excect of beaches in the Keys - it isn't Panama City with long wide stretches of sand and strong waves. The coral reef breaks the waves and catches much of the sediment, so there are few beaches and what there are are short and not very wide, yet the water, sky and vegetation is incredibly beautiful. There was quite a bit of seagrass in the water at Bahia Honda so swimming wouldn't have been great that day, but reading and walking on the beach was just as worth it. Don't listen to people's negative reviews of the Keys - just do your research and have the right expectations!", "title": "Perfect!", "user": "KCflowergirl", "date": "March 21, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 59160268}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "What a great place!

I ran across Dove Creek on TripAdvisor and I found it hard to believe it had such a positive rating. Nevertheless it seemed decent so we booked and we were very happy with Dove Creek. The staff was very pleasant and the facility was quite clean and quiet. The bed was quite comforable and we slept great. The only downsides we noticed were the hot water was tepid during the first few days of our trip, but so was the air temperature (in the 50's and 60's). When the weather warmed into the upper 60's and 70's the water was hot again. I was about to say something to the staff when it fixed itself (or perhaps they were on it already). We stayed in one of the rooms adjoining the lobby and the hallway door to the outside slams - but fortunately they lock that at 9pm! It did tend to wake us in the mornings, though. Only four of the rooms have these doors. It's nitpicking really, most of the time the facility as a whole was quite calm and peaceful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.", "title": "Wow", "user": "JohnSColumbus", "date": "February 22, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 56818860}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Came down for Valentines weekend to escape the cold.

Snapper's, the restaurant associated with Dove Creek had a varied menu with local seafood and the live music was enjoyable, ending before we went to sleep.

We enjoyed visiting the Islamorada area for restaurants ,especially the Islamorada Fish Company for beautiful sunsets and great smoked fish spread! We actually liked this area of the Keys better than Key West as we vacation more for relaxing and snorkeling than for clubs and shopping.
