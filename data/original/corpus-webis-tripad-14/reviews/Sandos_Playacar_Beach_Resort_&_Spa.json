We sent our daughter to the Kid's Club that day so she would have other kids to play with. The Kid's club is great, even for keeping really little ones entertained. After the torrential rains the weather was great the rest of our trip. The staff really do work very hard, so we tipped quite often. The shows at night were very good, even our daughter enjoyed them. As far as food goes, we really liked the Mexican and Italian restaurants, we ate at each one twice. We brought our daughter with us as well. Kids are welcome in the restaurants up until 7:00. Make sure you make a reservation for the restaurants the day before you want to go to them, otherwise you may not get in. Go to the reservation desk in the morning when they open at 8:00 for first pick at times. The buffets are good also, but after a while I was getting sick of them. The buffet at the Ola la restaurant has fewer choices than the Grand Buffet, but it is a lot less crowded for breakfast and dinner. Lunch time there is hectic because it is right next to the beach and pool. As far as getting a spot at the beach and pool we really didn't have any problems even though the hotel was booked. We always reserved some chairs by the pool before breakfast by putting some personal items on them. I got a massage at the beach one day and it was the best massage I ever had! It was supposed to be an hour, but it lasted an hour and a half!! Thanks Juan!!

Overall great resort, however, it would have been helpful to know the different sections of sleeping rooms and their set up prior to our booking.

Rooms are clean, sufficient size and room service is prompt and courteous. The Riviera part of the resort which is the furthest away from the beach, is the most desirable section to stay in but evidently for a higher price. The Riviera pool is the only one with a swim up pool bar. Due to lower than expected temperatures, all pools were too cold and the hot tubs were not hot. Gym is excellent and offers plenty of equipment. 2 tennis courts that you need to reserve well in advance, we did not accomplish a booking for 2 days. Restaurants: the El Gaucho was our least favorite. As read in other reviews posted, we have to agree that neither the food nor the service was good. Entrees were missing the ordered sauces, we were not offered refills on water unless we asked. Wine in all restaurants is mediocre to bad - except in the French restaurant.

We just returned from a week at the Gala Resort Playacar. We had a group of 12 9 adults and 3 kids (ages 7,7 & 11). I read all the reviews before we went to prepare and was glad that I did. First, we booked through Apple vacations and got a great price total of $3400 for 2 adults and 1 child (they broke it out as $1565/adult and $270/child). This included r/t airfare from Oakland, CA to Cancun and back on American, transfers to and from airport and 7 nights at Gala. We booked 7 months in advance because we were going at Spring Break. Apple was prompt with tickets and even had to reissue two tickets because of incorrect names (our mistake, not theirs which was discovered five days before we were scheduled to leave!) and did it with no charge and within two days! The reps on site left a little to be desired but I will get to that later. The flights were on time with minimum lay over in Dallas. The More room in Coach that American advertises really does make a difference. My husband is 66 and did not have his knees touching the seat in front of him like he does on other airlines. We were warned repeatedly that when you land in Cancun, that all of the information booths are time-share people they are!! They actually are quite nice and fine with you just nodding and walking right past them. What we werent prepared for was that as you start to exit the terminal with your baggage, if you have a cart, they stop you and tell you to take off your baggage. As you are taking it off, a porter runs up and grabs it and starts putting it on his cart. You sometimes have to fight to get it back. So if you do not want to have to tip a porter to take your bags outside, keep a good grip on them. Our transfer was waiting outside and we had no problem getting to the hotel. It is about a 45-minute ride. Check in was very smooth they had everything ready. We had requested to have all five rooms close and they were all in Room Tower 2 close to the pool and Ola-la restaurant very convenient. The rooms are large and clean but definitely not five star but after reading the reviews, we did not expect that so were quite happy with them. The king bed is wider than the ones we have in California, which was nice, but they are as hard as a rock!!! I like firm beds but by the end of the week, my hips hurt (I am a side sleeper). The maids do come twice a day once to clean and then turn down. We always seem to be missing something small after cleaning (a washcloth, hand towel, extra towel) but the linen closet was across from us and I just got use to helping myself. It is no problem to call and they will bring it but I found it faster to do it myself. The minibar is a joke. It isnt very cold and is very leaky. In fact, the minibar in the room next to ours leaked under the wall and into our closet luckily, it did not ruin my shoes. There were minor maintenance items that I noticed paint on dressers, closet door sticks, etc. but again, my expectation were not that high. The bathrooms were larger than I was expecting with nice size showers. Great hot water pressure but the cold trickled out the opposite of what you normally encounter in a hotel! They advertise four pools which is a little misleading. There is the adult pool and the other three pools are really one big pool with connecting shallow areas. But there was plenty of room in the pools. Not so with the chairs you really do need to get out early and put towels out to reserve chairs. No umbrellas around the chairs just the tables so very little shade at the pool. On the beach, however, the palapas provides great shade but again, you must get out early to reserve them. The beach was spectacular!! White, soft sand with turquoise green water my dive computer said the temperature was 82 degrees really wonderful!! It was very shallow and great for the kids. We only had one day with a red flag that had a very strong current. Bargain with any beach activity you son we got him down to $12 and then watched as the next group got him to agree to $10! We never saw any peddlers on the beach selling items like I am use to all over Mexico a part of me sort of missed it not sure why!!The food at the buffets was okay to good depending on what you got. I am extremely picky about food but could always find something to eat. Again, I was not expecting gourmet food so was not overly disappointed. We did not eat at the Italian restaurant since it didnt seem like any one like it but ate at the Mexican one twice. The food was much better than the buffets and you really do have to get in line at 8 in the morning to make reservations two days in advance. My husband did get food poisoning the first time we ate there he had the Flan for dessert and was sick all night!! Yes, we ate there again and no, he did not have the Flan so we are giving them the benefit of the doubt that it was a one shot occurrence. We were there when the hotel was oversold and expected to have long waits for drinks at the beach or pool. Never happened there always seemed to be some one there to take your orders. We did order two drinks at a time to save time but found the service to be efficient and friendly. Yes, we did tip for drinks and at meals, but only if a waiter had to bring us something. If we got it ourselves, we did not tip.For scuba divers the diving is right from the hotel and I felt very comfortable with the dive master. He checked and doubled checked everyones tanks and regulators. Beautiful and easy dives about 10 minutes by boat from beach. One couple diving with us were staying at one of the RIU hotels and said they were quoted $160 each for a one tank dive our hotel was $68 each for a two tank dive!! First dive had tons of turtles I stopped counting after 10! Second dive beautiful coral walls a few swim throughs, lots of fish. If you have the time, Cozumel is only a ferry ride away and has spectacular diving.The staff is at the Gala are extremely enthusiastic and hard w, music trivia, ping-pong tournament, etc. all day long. I now know why several reviews mentioned - AAYAH, AAYAH.... OOOOOH, OOOOH!!! It gets on your nerves but you learn to ignore it! The activities were great and kept the kids occupied. Unfortunately, we had a major fiasco the last day. My 7-year-old son won the ping-pong tournament the last day we were there. They make a big deal out of the winners every night at the shows bringing them on stage and presenting them with award certificates and prizes. He was told to make sure and be there by 9 pm to get a good seat. He talked about it all day worried that we would not be done with dinner on time and was feeling very important! We were in our seats by 9 pm show starts at 9:30, hum they didnt call up winners. We waited thinking they would do it at a natural break no. Half way through, we remind a staff member that Connor was waiting in the audience to get his prize no problem, we were told, they will do it at the end. Now it is at the end and they are introducing the cast my husband and I grab the MC and remind him yet again that Connor is waiting no problem, we are again told. All of a sudden it is over and everyone leaves!!! Now, as a parent, to see your child be totally let down and disappointed and not understanding why they ignored him but no one else the rest of the week, you start to see red. I will completely admit that at this point, I become rather emotional and vocal. We went backstage and confronted the cast and was told Oh, sorry, it wasnt that kind of show!!! Not sure what that meant unless it was to cover up their mistake. They came out and handed him a certificated that had the name Andrew on it his name is Connor - and an adults t-shirt. I marched to the front desk and asked for the hotel manager and, yes, I admit, I let him have it. I know that I was out of hand and probably shocked the manager with my anger but I felt that no guest, especially a child, should be disappointed as thoroughly as he was. He had no explaways given at the show and the he asked what he could do to make it up to my son and I told him nothing, since we were leaving the next morning. He said he would think of something. We made up a story for my son that the computers were down and that they were going to fix the certificate. The next morning, when we went to check out, they did make a big deal for Connor. They had balloons, candy and a ceramic box and several staff dressed up as cartoon characters and took pictures with him. And, most importantly, they had a certificate with his name on it and not some one elses. It did make up for it but it overall left a horrible last impression of the hotel.As for the Apple rep on site they are nice but you have to stay on top of them. We booked two trips for 12 each. One to Coba and one to Xcaret both were great and I highly recommend them. However, the Apple rep, Eduardo, was not good at details and quoted the wrong times for busses and assured us that we would have a private van to Xcaret since we had 12 people and the vans only fit 12 people. The van thing was not true it is a tour bus minor detail but, again, misinformation. We did find out the right times ourselves but it was irritating to have to work to get the right information yourselves! When we mentioned this to the replacement rep Ana her comment was I know, Eduardo got too busy and let some details slide. Our transfer to leave also had slight problems they only had four of us listed so I grabbed Ana. She looked at me like she had never seen me before and asked if everyone had come to her office with the transfers. I rather pointedly reminded her that when that I specifically asked if she needed everyone to come down and she, several times, said no, that she would put all twelve on my voucher. She had to call her office and told me another bus was coming for the other 8 people but four of us had to go now on this bus. When the second bus came, he had all 12 of us on his list and had to spend 15 minutes finding Ana and clearing ort with plenty of time but again; it was not as we were told. We found that to be the case not only with the Apple rep, but also with the front desk and Public relations (concierge desk) staff. You would ask for something, they would smile and say yes. You would ask for it a certain way no problem you were told but it never quite worked out that way. We figure that they were trained to just say yes to anything just to get you to walk away. All in all, they were minor irritations but are worth mentioning to be aware of. You are in a different country and things just dont get done as well or as correctly as you are use to.For you shoppers, the shopping in the Playacar area is as good if not better than going into Playa del Carmen but it is smaller. If you have the time, do both. If time is limited, go to Playacar you can walk or ride bikes from hotel (about 5 minutes away).Now, would I go back to the Gala maybe! We talked with a lot of quests that have been coming there for years and most seem to think the Gala is the best on that stretch of beach, primarily for its location and size. PLUSES Best beach, medium size so not too spread out, Good waiters/waitresses, decent (not great) food, nice size rooms, friendly staff, extremely kid friendly, Security very evident. MINUSES older hotel so more run down, rock hard beds, Front desk not good with details, little to no shade at pool, buffet food got very repetitive. All in all, at the price that we paid, we more than felt like we got our moneys worth. No, this is not a five star hotel by American standards (more like a 3 1/2) but more than adequate to enjoy the beautiful Mayan Riviera.", "helpfulness": 26, "user": "sierranevada", "date": "April 30, 2003", "id": 985719}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great time Great place", "text": "We just got back and had the best vacation ever.

Our son, a high school senior, and our daughter, 20 and in college, had their own room next to ours. Except for our daughter, this was our first trip to Mexico. I would have to agree with some previous reviews that the Gala is not a 5 star resort. We arrived around 10:30 am with very few other parties checking in at that time, and still had to wait until checkin time of 3pm to get into 1 room, and the other not until 4:30. The rooms were ground level and smelled very musty. Decor very basic but clean. The first night our fridge defrosted and luckily I caught myself when I slipped on the water that was all over the floor. They came quickly and it just needed adjusting. Yes , the beds are very hard! My daughter was the only one who got a backache after sleeping on them though. Our shower stall floor went right into the bathroom area with no type of divider to keep the water out other than the shower curtain which was weird (the kids bath was fine.) So we used extra towels to mop up after each shower. Contrary to recent reviews, we thought the food was very good. Such a wide variety that I would think anyone could find something they enjoyed. We ate once at the Mexican and Italian restaurants and had good meals with great service. Again make your reservations early for these. Some mornings people were already waiting in line before the public relations desk opened at 8 am. But it was a holiday week and the place was full. The sports and entertainment staff are friendly and lots of fun. They work very hard and there is always something going on. In that respect the Gala probably wasn't the best fit for us. There didn't seem to be much down time so it always seemed very busy and someone always on a microphone running some sort of event. That's why I feel it is great for families with kids who want to keep them busy, or adults who just have to be doing something all the time- the Gala is your place! We got involved in a few of is spectacular! Great swimming all week, with the last day having pretty decent waves making it fun to boogieboard. You had to get up early (6:30) to save chairs around the pool or on the beach with shade. But there seemed to always be enough chairs at the beach whenever you went but they would be in the sun. The pools were somewhat dissappointing. The main pool is three small pools together where the activities take place, rarely quiet ,always busy, no waterfalls or anything special like some places we have been. My son was the only one who used it and that was to play basketball with some kids. If you want a more relaxing atmosphere the adult pool is the place, although it is not exactly the best. This pool is fairly small, and not really private as the pool side restaurant and bar overlooks it, with a constant stream of diners from morning until 5pm. We found the drinks just right, and if they were any stronger would probably not made it through a day on the beach! We tipped from time to time, just because they work so hard, but I felt the service was very good with a tip or not. The front desk service was nothing special.

Twice a day they ran games/contests near the pool that our big kids LOVED! The water aerobics class is also pretty fun, even if you usually don't do stuff like that. People here are very nice and positive. Lots of visitors besides Americans, which we really liked. Got a great massage but a pretty marginal pedicure. Food is pretty ordinary, except for the Italian resturant (Which I liked quite a bit - great gnocci) and the MExican restaurant which was also pretty good. Make your reservations right away each morning or you'll never get in (with kids.) Wine at both places is from Baja California and not too great -- white is slightly better. Oh, and when you order margaritas, ask for a shot of Jose Cuervo Gold on the side and add it to the drink yourself, otherwise they are pretty weak. Or ask for double and tip a buck or two the first time. The rest of the food isn't bad but it isn't great either -- best choices are the fresh omlets and the pasta bar. If they are out of chocolate ice cream or Froot Loops, just ask the manager and he'll track them down. Only went to two shows -- Mexican and Circus -- not bad and the kids loved them. Kids club was fine but nothing exceptional. We used it more as a place for a break than full child care. They were very patient with our unhappy toddler and she did well, playing with the toy kitchen and blocks a lot. Our bigger kids were happy to play nintendo there and got to paint pottery (be sure to pick it up at the appointed day, we forgot and they had trouble finding the pieces) and go to the disco in the early evening. Sunrises are nice and bring a kite to fly in the a.m. or early evening -- easy and fun. Kids can also paint pottery on their own (poolsiusy for an hour.) Go to Xel-Ha, very easy and very impressive snorkleing. Just wear t-shirts over your suit and reapply the biodegradable sunscreen they require -- it wore off my oldest and she fried (they also sell it in the Gala gift shop.)

Overall it was a good experience but not a spectacular one. First, a few things that I like about this place: the rooms are clean and comfortable. In addition to two full size beds, there is a twin size mattress on a platform so that the room could sleep five comfortably. The beach is very clean, water clear, blue and very calm the days that we were there. We have stayed in Cancun several times, at Marriott Casa Magna, Hilton, Fiesta Americana Condessa, and the waves there were big every time and water came to our neck just a few feet into the water, but here the water is much calmer and shallower, and we felt much safer being in the water here. The entertainment staff is great, especially those who lead water aerobics or games in the pool and on the beach. There is a bingo game every afternoon which the little kids enjoy. There is a counter right at the beach where you can book snorkeling or diving trips, parasailing, banana boat, wave runner, etc., very convenient. We walked over there to pay for banana boat and waverunners and about 10 minutes later those things arrived and we just hopped on. The hotel overall is nice and clean. Now, things that I'm not too impressed about: some things in the room were not working properly; the fridge was not cold and drinks were not restocked, leaky faucet in the bathroom, a/c too cold and could not be adjusted, in short poor maintenance. The food in the restaurants was average at lunch and mediocre at dinner; one evening we showed up around 7:30 and the buffet was practically cleaned out of food; the kids were hungry because they could not find anything edible the other nights and we had to order room service for them. We had dinner at the italian restaurant one night; it took an hour for food to arrive at the table, just when we were about to give up and walk out, and the food was definitely not worth the wait. The wait staff at the buffet restawere so understaffed that these workers were merely trying to get things done and over with rather than trying to be pleasant. The front desk people also did not seem to be customer oriented at all. There were not many organized activities for kids, especially for teenagers. Our teen had a great time there only because he met some teens that clicked and they hung out and played sports together. The little one was bored because there were not enough things for him to do. We are not planning to come back any time soon. We are going to the Iberostar Tucan this July and hope to have a more pleasant experience there.", "helpfulness": 11, "user": "Beachlover2007", "date": "April 23, 2003", "id": 981934}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Disappointed in the Gala", "text": "When you're checking out, most hotels ask how your stay was. I had prepared several responses before I was to check out of the Gala yesterday. Luckily (for them), they didn't bother to ask. (not surprising at all, given my experience there) In reality, I wouldn't have known where to begin.Just to be fair, I shouldn't fault the hotel for being what it is: Motor Inn quality rooms with a better view and wonderful weather. And I should also point out that we had just stayed at a hotel that was ACTUALLY very nice, before arriving at the Gala; making the Gala especially disappointing.But there's just no getting past the obvious. I was there to attend a friend's wedding, so I didn't make the choice to stay there, myself. Had there not been a wedding, or if the Gala didn't require two night's security deposit for cancellations, I would've immediately walked out. (Here's a tip: They don't really have beds. They poured concrete in the shape of beds and a \"bench\", then put mattresses and cushions on the painted concrete. I'm not making this up!!!)Knowing that I'd be staying at the Gala for two nights, I checked the Internet to find photographs before I left for Mexico. There's a reason you can only find a handful of photographs of the actual hotel or the rooms, on the Internet...even at their web site! It's not very appealing.I read both the positive and negative reviews here and I have to wonder who the people are who \"love\" the Gala? I'm sorry if that sounds a bit rude, but at best, it's a low-rent Holiday Inn on a nice stretch of property. I can't believe anyone would think otherwise. Granted, I've stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world. But I have also stayed at mid-priced hotels, and even the occasional motel. The Gala was on par with a motel, save it's fabulous natural surroundings.Okay, if you have children, it's probably a glorious experience to be able to take them someplace that welcomes kids. Similarly, if you like seafood or you're a big boozehound, idea. But, trust me...if you have any expectation of a REAL five star hotel experience, or even a three star hotel, you'll be gravely disappointed, if not offended, by the Gala Resort.Sure, the lobby is quaint and exotic in appearance. But it is open-air and VERY warm. That would be fine if you could ever be served right away. But everything takes time at the Gala. I saw one poor little ill girl, encircled by her worried family, waiting forever to see the doctor, and the mother begging for a blanket to cover the shivering child.Good luck making phone calls, too! For my last night in Mexico, I certainly wasn't going to request an additional night at the Gala. (shudder) So, I tried to call the toll-free number of a more favoured hotel chain, in order to make a reservation for Cancun. I was willing to pay the $10 USD connection fee (!) for a toll-free number from my room phone, but could not get through. I asked at the travel agency if they could make a reservation for me, but the employee said she could only book reservations as part of a tour group. She did sell me a phone card, though. That worked just fine, except they only sell phone cards in one denomination. The toll-free operator had almost completed my reservation when I ran out of time. I then went to the front desk to complain about my almost hour-long struggle to call a simple toll-free number and was told to go back to my room and ask for the hotel operator. I did so, knowing about the $10 connection fee, but was told by the hotel operator that she couldn't get through. She suggested a few dialling options I could try on my own. None of them worked. I left my room again, and went back to the travel agency for another phone card, to call the toll-free number again. The phone cards are so quick, I ran out of time before I even got the confirmation number. But, thankfully, I did complete the reservation.What else? Let me see...Nothing is air conditioned, except the rooms. However, you can't turn the thermostats below 70F. Similarly, aRY humid during our stay, making any outdoor activity pretty sweaty. I needed to take at least 2 showers per day. Unfortunately, the shower didn't work in our room. I noticed this immediately and called a repairperson right away. He apparently worked on the shower while we were out of our room, and forgot his tools there. He didn't fix the shower, though. And never returned to claim his tools. For our entire stay, we had to use the hand held faucet, putting it down to lather, picking it up to rinse, etc. No big deal. Just annoying.If you're anywhere near the pool, you'll never be able to leave your patio door open. The children's games, etc. are extremely loud and disruptive. We took some video of a beautiful parrot that landed on our balcony. After watching it just now, at home, one couldn't miss the constant, deafening, background bullhorn and squealing, emanating from the pool area.The mini bar is just a joke! I unlocked it (Can you believe they lock them???? They dont even lock them in regular hotels anymore, much less all-inclusive resorts!), only to find just a few cans of soda and 1 or 2 beers. No food or snacks of any kind.The room service menu had slim pickings. When we did order breakfast yesterday, we were very disappointed. The thermal carafe is either ALWAYS used for coffee or never washed. The hot water for our tea was repugnant. Sadly, I didn't discover this 'til my first sip. The croissants were terrible, as well. If you do go to the Gala, stick with the juice and fruit plate for room service breakfast.I didn't find the staff as wonderful as many people suggested they would be. While everyone was generally pleasant, some had an air of being tired of arrogant tourists. At every opportunity, I'd speak Spanish and show appropriate respect and thanks for any assistance. But I found this was appreciated much more outside the Gala resort, for the most part. The food was NOT great, as so many people suggested. Elements of it were good, but we ate two meals at the Gala before chooya del Carmen. (Yes, even though the Gala is an all-inclusive \"resort\", we CHOSE to pay for our food elsewhere.) For example, the night before arriving at the Gala, I had a deliciously delicate salad of field greens and ripe vegetables in a subtle dressing, as my first course. In comparison, I wouldnt dare touch most of the buffet items I saw at the Gala.What we DID like were:*Many of the employees. The vast majority were generous and pleasant, if not always helpful.*The beach. As it is all across the Mayan Riviera, the beach is glorious.*The access to various activities, such as sailing, windsurfing, kayaking, scuba diving and snorkelling, etc.***N.B. All of these things (and more!) can be found at much nicer hotels.Overall, I would say that my stay at the Gala Resort was extremely disappointing. Our fist night in Cancun, we stayed at the J.W. Marriot, and were thrilled! We will definitely be back there!!! (Were already planning our next trip!) My last night in Cancun, I stayed at the Hilton. While it was no \"J.W.\", it was infinitely better than the Gala. It's funny how simple things like proper room service, a working shower, and real air conditioning can combine to make a vacation so much more pleasant.My impression of the Gala was that they scrimped in every possible way to eek a profit out of such a mediocre place. Not the worst hotel, but below average in quality and service.

I had read alot of reviews before going and was excited to get home and write my own and answer questions that I had that I did not see in other reviews. We took our two year old son with us and I was concerned that he might need to be potty trained, but your child does not need to be trained to go to the kids club. They do lots of activities with the children, swimming, crafts. I did not see them play alot outside on the toys, but all the children seemed to be having fun. You must sign your child up at 10:00am the first day you want them to join. Our son would not leave our side although so we hired a babysitter that went with us to the beach to watch after him so we could swim and just relax. You set this up through customer relations 15.00 for the service and 5.00 per hour. One day we even hired a babysitter to just go in town with me so I could shop at a regular store and do some laundry. This was great the lady took me to a place that I was able to drop off my laundry and I only paid $6.00 and the gentleman washed, dried and folded it for me and it came back smelling GREAT! if you use the hotel service for laundry it is like $15.00 per shorts, $20.00 per shirt way to much. Two things I would strongly recommend, take lots of one dollar bills. we took $200.00 in one dollar bills and we ran out and it is very hard to get them there. You have to get them from the maids or bus boys and they do not like to give them up. Take as many small bills as you can $1, $5, $10. these are easier for them to cash. You do not have to tip. But I tell you the better you tip the better your service is. $2.00 dollars a day is left for the maid who cleans your room. and every bar tender there loved my husband and his friend because they always tipped a dollar or two and as soon as they walked to the bar they received service before all,And there drinks were strong!!The other is we packed tons of clothes, and I am telling you , you will spend most of your time in a few bathing suites and a few shorts and tanks and that is it. I took 4 suitcases and wore only a few pair of shorts because everyone is running around in bathing suites. I just put on shorts for supper. maybe pack one dress outfit if you plan to go to one of the pay restaurants. We never did that because there is always so much food. And every night we had different food on the buffets. I did get the massage on the beach. I went through the beauty shop to do it. I would recommend you go to the massage therapist on the beach. It is on the left side of the beach. They are trained and the girls in the shop are not and they will tell you they will massage you on the beach but it is not as good as I seen the massage therapist do. And they only messaged me for 40 minutes and I paid for an hour. There were a few women who laid out topless on the beach. This didn't seem to bother anyone, but I thought for a family resort they should have covered up. Lots of kids all over the beach. If you go to the right side of the beach there is para-sailing, wave runners and so on. They are all at a cost of coarse.When we arrived are bar wasn't stocked, but they usually come around 3:00pm to stock it. Getting in to Mexico was a mess at the airport, but leaving was a breeze and coming back into the states was a breeze as well. remember if you buy anything made from Cuba like cigars, you are not permitted to bring them back into the USA. So they tell you to get rid of them or not to buy them. But There are ways around it. e-mail me and I will let you know.I found are room very nice and clean. I was concerned that the bed might be to hard after reading the reviews, but it was just right for our family. I asked our friends who went also and she said she thought they were a little hard, but I was fine. There are iguanas all over the place and even a Parrott one night flew to are balcony to visit until my son scared him away. Please check out the disco it is really alot of fun even if your not a drinker.PLEASE BE WARE of the Bar Tour. #10 rth it. $55.00 per person and you end up with 4 tickets for each bar and after that you have to buy your own.

The Riviera Maya gives you a taste of the Carribean for less than Jamaica or any other typical \"Carribean resorts\". The strong suit here is the kids activities. If you have kids under 12 and they have an outgoing personality, bring them here. The staff play games with them all day long and the kids look like they are having a great time! The staff work incredibly hard, especially the entertainment staff, who put in 12-16 hours/day ending with a very enjoyable stage show in the evening. I was on my honeymoon, but the set-up seemed to accomadate just about anyone, except maybe those prize seculsion above all else. Our drinks were not watered down at all, even without tipping (we normally did tip though) and they are willing to make you just about anything. It helps if you speak a little spanish to get by. We went on the Maya Adventure tour offered by Apple Vacations and that was the highlight of the trip. We snorkeled in two cenotes (and they are arguably better than ocean snorkeling) which was suprisingly colorful and the water was crystal clear and one brackish lagoon in Akmul! The best Mexican food offered during the whole trip was during lunch on this trip (absolutely delicious). We also took the snorkeling trip out to the reef for $30pp through the Gala Resort dive shop and that was really nice (well worth the money). If you eat, drink, and do alot of activities, staying at this all-inclusive is worth the money. The staff is very friendly and we would definately go back. We went in early June and the resort was maybe 1/2 full and that made it very easy. I imagine that when it is filled to capacity, it may be harder to enjoy as lounge chairs, restaraunt reservations, ect. may be harder to acquire, but we had no problem any time of day. The only complaint was the hard beds, but it turns out that mattresses are placed on raised concrete blocks so I don't see a remedy coming any time soon. P.S. Since is was our honeymoon, we arrived in our room to find fresh flower po the bed. The bed was then adorned with more flowers, petals, and towels reshaped into swans. On the table, there was a bottle of wine in an ice bucket and a fresh fruit platter with chocolates. This was absolutely spectacular!

Bad first impression when we arrived, our rooms were not ready; however, we aren't complete jerks and just changed in a private room into our swim-suits and hit the beach (afterall, thats why we came here)...Food was pretty good on some nights and others OK. Just depends on what you like, although they do try to offer a wide selection based on whatever \"theme\" is for the night. I recommend eating early. The Italian restaurant requires RSVP, so do that ASAP. Personally, my favorite meal is breakfast and they do an excellent job of outdoing themselves here - whatever you want, its probably there, especially \"made to order\" omlettes/eggs. Fresh fruits/juices/breads/etc... Even though its an \"all-inclusive\" resort, we chose to eat out in Playa del Carmen one night at \"La Parilla\" - AWESOME!People are incredibly friendly and the city is safe! Shopping is abundant in Playa del Carmen.There's actually alot to do at night especially in Playa del Carmen. Remember, all drinks are included and happy hour is like every other hour all day/night (I never quite figured out happy hours). Our daytime activities we plentiful with kayaking, snorkeling, jet skiing, sailing, Cozumel... most of which is at your disposal, but I suggest a separate snorkeling tour out to a reef. We also took a tour of the ancient Pyramids in Coba to squeeze in some culture. One caveat, alot of people run their own tours and there's no industry standard, so beware of what your actually buying. On one tour, we thought we were going swimming in a natural spring, but it was brown swamp water. Another time we thought we were kayaking in caves - not true. Oh yeah, never \"pre-pay\" anything.Like I said, our group was pretty laid back and we came here to relax and get away. This isn't the U.S., so don't expect things to work the same way!

We are a family of 5 - 3 boys 7, 14, and 16. The kids had a fantastic time - which more importantly - means my husband and I had a fantastic time. Playa del Carmen is so beautiful and the resort was just what I needed. Honestly the rooms are very average and the food is very average - I would have really liked some healthier food choices. But I had never been to an all-inclusive and cant imagine taking the kids anywhere else. If you're hungry - go eat - what a concept. My stress levels went way down not having to deal with the restaurant routine . I didnt think the Italian and Mexican restaurants were anything to rave about- but you do get burnt out on the buffet scene so its worth getting to the reservation desk at 8:00am. to make the reservations. We were booked in a Junior Suite - which had 2 queen beds and a pullout couch. Beware these rooms are all the way at the back of the hotel and is quite a trek to the action. Next time I would get way closer to the beach. Also if you dont get to the beach at 6:00am ish the shade is taken at the beach. To get around that - book the Gala Club - it's extra and you have reserved shade - definately worth it. I guess this sounds like a negative review but I thought I'd get the annoying things out of the way. My 7 year old was in heaven - the staff really are awsome with kids - cajoling- and encouraging them to join in all the activities. My teenagers had a blast - They were at the disco every night or just hanging out with other teens. It is an international crowd and my boys loved it! They did'nt come back to the room till pretty late but we felt very safe there. Being the psyco organizer that I am I had a whole itinerary worked out for our week in Playa - but my family cried Uncle! They just wanted to hang out at the resort. We did go to Tulum(early like the guide books say) and we swam with Dolphins at Playa Aventuras which impressed even my too-hip gang.
