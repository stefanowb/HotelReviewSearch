The hotel location is great since it is a short walk to the subway or short distance tax drives to many places around. Whenever we need a taxi, the bellman was quick to get it for us. We had a chance to meet our housekeeping attendant one morning and her big smile was contagious. She did a great job to keep our room nice, clean and organized. Overall whenever I go back to NY, this is the place where I will stay again and again\u2026", "title": "Service oriented, friendly staff, and specious room\u2026", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Purchasing2000", "date": "June 7, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 111908446}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Stayed here for the second time yesterday.

Decor was fabulous, rooms were really spacious (that's a huge plus for NYC), and the rooftop pool was a major plus. So incredible to be able to see the Empire State Building while tanning! Gym was top-notch, and the location is perfect. It's just a cool vibe with good service. I would never stay anywhere else again. You are within walking distance to Union Square, Midtown, Soho, etc. And last, but not least, the doormen were very cool - so helpful, and kind. Especially Danny (bellman/doorman) - ask for him, he'll totally make you feel like a VIP.
