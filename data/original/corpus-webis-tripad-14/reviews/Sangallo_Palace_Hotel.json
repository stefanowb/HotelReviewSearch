Fortunately, we hadn't pre-paid for our stay. The hotel was very basic, including the rooms. We stayed in May, not quite summer but not quite winter and the hotel had switched off their heating system. We arrived and it was cold and raining and we spent our first night shiffering in our room. We brought this to the attention of staff the next morning, asking if we could please have some heating and we were informed that it had been switched off and would not be switched back on until next winter. I couldn't help noticing that the shampoo bottles were being stacked into the dishwasher behind the small lobby bar. Not only that, but it seemed that every second light was off (no bulb) - clearly there was some cost cutting going on. Not willing to experience a second chilling night in the hotel, we checked out (after an uncomfortable scene with the female Manager). We will say that we found the Irish/Italian man on reception very friendly and he helped as much as he could but he was up against a hotel which was clearly struggling financially and had therefore cut services to a minimum. We moved on to Spoletto and stayed in a charming and very warm Villa. Be warned, Perugia is visually charming but there is a undercurrent of crime and drugs and we never felt entirely comfortable there.", "title": "No heating in this hotel during a very cold snap!", "user": "WeRHappyTravellers", "date": "July 25, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 72215850}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at this hotel for a few days on a trip touring Italy.
