Also, be prepared for a 2 hour bus ride from the Montego Bay airport. If you want to see the Dunn's River Falls, i would not recommend the tour from the hotel. We spent $350 US for one of the Cool Runnings canamerans (including water shoe rental and tips). The boat was over crowded with almost no shade. The trip included snorkeling on a degraded reef outside Ocho Rios with very few fish. After spending over an hour hiking up the Dunn's River Falls, there was a \"party\" with rum drinks, 70's music (Village People anyone?) and no food. The staff screamed through the microphones. We arrived back at the hotel starving and deaf.

The jerk hut was my favorite. Salads become a little boring by the end of the week, but there was always a great selection for any tastes. I find it hard to believe people could not find a decent meal. We tried 1 a la carte (Sir John), which was good. It was much more private which is a nice change from the hustle of the buffets. We did upgrade to a Jr. Suite, but unless you get a really good deal like we did ($60 for the week), it's really not worth it. The walk to the main restaurant is long, and for that matter, there was only the Japanese restaurant and Mamee Bay which you need reservations for anyway. The roms was beautiful, but so were the standard rooms and they were much closer to everything. I did however like the privacy on the suite side. No noise from the pool or restaurants is really appreciated at night when you are trying to sleep.

It faces the ocean and the beach is about 20 yards away. A beautiful setup. Once we got to our room on the fourth floor, our view was spectacular, we were able to see most of the complex and the beach from where we were at. Note: if you get booked in an oceanview room ask to stay in Building \"C\" because it's much closer to the pool, gym, buffet restaurant etc. The other Building \"A\" you'd have to walk a little more to get to those places. We really didn't expect anything less than what we got from our room. It was clean, the drink fridge was fully stocked always and the liquor dispensers were always full. The only snafu we experienced was that our toilet tank lever broke off but the RIU maintenence staff responded within half an hour and the problem was fixed by the time we got back to the room after dinner. Their followup calls to see if we were doing okay were a nice touch. Overall, I feel the staff at the RIU were great.

When you're at the pool, try ordering a \"Purple Rain\" it's a tasty purple cocktail laced with rum and you'll love it. As for the beach, it was beautiful and I was definitely happy tanning there almost every day. A can't miss is the Jerk Hut on the beach.

So it was nice to just enjoy the beach without a countless stream of peddlers interrupting you. Some Caribbean resorts I've been to have no such policy for their guests and vendors on the beach sometimes get pretty annoying. Just a little advice, Jamaican vendors outside the resort can get a little agressive. So if you plan to do any shopping in Ocho Rios and don't want to get hassled every 15 seconds a nice but firm \"NO Mon, I'm good\" will suffice. But by all means haggle with them if you see something you're interested in, don't take the first offer. The only time we ventured off the resort was to go on a shopping/ botanical garden/ Dunn's River excursion. The whole tour took 6 hours and cost $45US. The highlight was Dunn's River Falls and yes you will get soaked on this tour. Just ensure you buy aqua shoes beforehand because trekking up the rocks can get pretty slippery and you probably don't want to rent the water shoes $5US for obvious hygienic reasons.", "user": "lovegoingsouth", "date": "May 4, 2008", "id": 15639275}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great time...Few things to expect.", "text": "If you plan on buying liquor on your trip, wait until the airport.
