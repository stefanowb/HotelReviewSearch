No casino! Not on the strip! Yeah! It's quiet and the suite rooms have everything. If you're going to Vegas for business or for other than gambling/partying, this is a great option. Best if you have a rental car to get around, although it is on the monorail. The pool is small, but nicely appointed with an outdoor bar. The hotel has no restaurant so you either have to eat out or can prepare your own dinner in the kitchenette which is fully furnished.

The Hilton Grand Vacation Suites was the answer to all of our concerns. The facility is very clean, the rooms are large and well appointed, there is no casino or bars on the property so the party crowd tends to stay elsewhere. It is off the strip, which also helps, but is just a five minute walk from the Las Vegas Hilton (now the LVH hotel and casino) monorail station. Also, NO resort fees, free in room internet access and free covered parking. This place is the best place to stay in Vegas and we will always be staying there on return trips.

We then checked out the pool, where you could rent towels and noodles for free. The pool was just the right depth and just the right temerature. I think the it was my favorite part of the hotel.
