We were greeted so warmly, and I instantly felt at home when we entered our cottage (# 1). Really large, with galley kitchen, large sitting area, beautiful, comfortable bed, gas fireplace, large bathroom with a fabulous jacuzzi tube. Many of the features of the cottage are from original structures, including the beautiful peg and plank wood floors. My favorite part? It was a toss up between the amazing basket of Bouchon Bakery goodies, fruit, o.j. and newspaper delivered every morning or the chiminea and private seating area (complete with s'mores kit it you want it) that we enjoyed every evening.", "title": "Home away from home plus excellent \"extras\"", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "MelvinaSt.Louis", "date": "February 3, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 151318007}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2013, traveled with friends", "text": "Oh, and the service.

The level of service and amenities offered are unique. It almost defies description as it is not a hotel nor is it a bed and breakfast. It is soooo much more. From complimentary transportation to and from the Yountville restaurants .....to the private patio where we enjoyed cheese and wine in the evening beside a fire ......to breakfast served each morning via picnic basket delivered to our front door filled with the best Bouchon Bakery had to offer, every expection was exceeded.
