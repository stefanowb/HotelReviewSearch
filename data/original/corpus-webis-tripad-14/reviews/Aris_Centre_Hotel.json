The breakfast, included, was one of the most extensive we had on our European trip. The room and bathroom were very clean and nice sized. Our room was on the top floor and there were 2 fast, reasonably sized elevators. The biggest negative was that the internet connection in the lobby was very expensive to use.

We paid 89 euros Very cheap by European standards. Because I had read tripadvisor evaluations, I came prepared. Yes, there is no shampoo, I brought a small tube for our use. Yes, the pillows are very thin, but that is quickly solved by asking for extra pillows at the desk. The room is spartan , the TV is small. You can't even buy a bottle of water . There is practically no service, and no bell hops.But it is clean and very comfortable.The breakfast is sufficient, but no coffee shop nor room service. But, right across the street you have the best Belgian waffles in the world. Also rows of cafes and restaurants all walking distance from the hotel. It is so ideally located that you walk to Grand Place, walk to the train station, walk to the Beaux Arts museum and to the bus stop of the hop off-hop bus is just a few minutes away next to the train station. It is not noisy specially if you ask or an interior room. For the price we paid I felt we got a really good deal. Do not make the mistake of booking though agencies that get into the web site when you access the hotel. Go directly to the web site of the hotel. I post this because I find that the critics have helped me a lot. I hope mine helps others.
