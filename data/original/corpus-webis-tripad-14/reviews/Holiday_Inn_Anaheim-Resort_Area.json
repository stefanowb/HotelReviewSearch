We had a room with a king size bed and the room was very large and so was the bathroom. There was more than enough space. The staff was very friendly and it only took us about 5 minutes to get checked in. The maid service was excelent no matter what time we left the room for the day. The room was very clean and very new. I read all of the reviews of this hotel before going to it and the people that give it bad reviews must never be satisfied with anything. There is no highway noise at all (the people who complain about that must have very very sensitive ears) and the air conditioners are not that loud. I never heard anybody else through the walls either. This place was great expecially for the $72 a night I paid. There is plenty of parking. I had a rental car so I did not take the shuttle to disney but I saw the shuttle there every time I went to the parking lot so it comes very regularly. Disney is only about 1 mile away, and there are plenty of other things to do. We went to Hungtington Beach which is only about a 20 min. drive and we also went to other LA area attractions. The hotel is great cuz its right by I-5. The only things that were less than perfect are the fact that the pool is shared by the Holidy Inn and the hotel next door so it gets kind of crowded, and the restaurant is not all that great. This place is awesome though, there were a lot of families and the kids were having a blasts and the parents looked happy too. Its a perfect location to stay no matter what you are doing in the LA area because it is pretty central.", "title": "Perfect Hotel", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Badpolarity", "date": "June 26, 2005", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 3612030}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Nice hotel", "text": "My family stayed at the Holiday Inn Anaheim Resort Area June 11 - June 16, 2005.

In fact, you may take a small lunch in, sandwich, chips, apple a drink (such as a Capri Sun, ie) in the park. They even have a designated picnic area you can have your lunch at. When you have a large family going to Disney, lunch can cost a small fortune. I was told also there was free breakfast for the kids, with a paying adult.

We found the food in the restaurant was good, kids 12 and under eat free, there could of been more choices on the kids menu. The shuttle service to and from the hotel was excellent, the staff friendly and helpful, our room was always made up and clean. It was our first time in Anaheim, and had the best time, we found the best place to eat, it was a couple of blocks from Disneyland called Mimi's, we went there for supper one night with our 11 year old daughter, and it cost us about the same as it did for lunch the day before. My husband and I each had a beer, and pasta, my daughter had chicken fingers and pop, the portions were big, and the food was great!
