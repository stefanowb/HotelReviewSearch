This is hard to explain, (bear with me!) - Next door's ensuite was built into our room, not with a full wall, but with a thin partial wall that reached to a metre or so from the ceiling. We could hear every noise that next door made, from their toilet habits (in gruesome detail), to their late-night showers, and every time they switched the bathroom light on in the night it lit up our bedroom ceiling! As our ensuite was built into the next room, I imagine they had the same problem. Other things weren't ideal - for example, there is no reception desk so when we arrived we felt a little bit lost and ended up in the breakfast room looking for staff; As such, help on finding our way around/maps etc wasn't offered, and we had to ask for this. No-one asked how our stay was, and my Mum stopped me making a complaint as she didn't want to be thought of as a problem.

The reception of the staff was unwelcoming and despite me reporting that I had a booking with booking.com the sole staff said 'let's see if we have any rooms'. He also asked to see the price I had paid through booking.com which I found odd. The room was on the third floor with no elevator (not a severe factor, just inconvenient for my elderly parents in law who were staying). The room was quite large but the outlay of the furniture was illogical, with the bed facing the room and blocking the access to the window. Finally the tv was broken and when I went to complain to the clerk he claimed it was a problem with Virgin and would be fixed within hours, instead it stayed broken the next morning while the tv in the lobby worked fine... So probably the staff preferred lying about the tv than admit that the cable was broken. Again, not a huge problem normally but my parents in law really rely on being able to watch tv. Finally, there was a duvet lying on the floor right outside the room that room- service had failed to get out of the way.
