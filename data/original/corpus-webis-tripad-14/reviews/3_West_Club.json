I used this hotel as a backup while I was trying to get a cheaper hotel on priceline. As luck would have it, there was no inventory mid-week on priceline for our dates, so we ended up staying here. For some reason, prices for that week appeared higher than usual for NYC. As a result, the 3 West Club was one of the better bargains I could get at $214 per night ($247 w/tax) without a long list of negative reviews and scary stories. We were, however, a little hesitant because there were so few reviews, and we could find no other information about the hotel, even on their website.
