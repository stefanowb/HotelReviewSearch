I found Brown's Wharf Inn through Tripadvisor. Both were terrific finds. The room was clean and comfortable and despite the huge yacht that was moored at the wharf and visible outside of our room blocking the views we loved our stay at the Inn. Our only complaint was that although the rooms are all nonsmoking, the balconies are not and we had to close our door and turn on the airconditioner despite the pleasant evening because of our neighbor smoking cigars on the balcony and it was floating into our room. On our whalewatching tour we learned that many celebrities choose Brown's to stay at when they visit Boothbay, we certainly will again as well.", "title": "Beautiful Views of the Harbor", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Momofpreteens", "date": "August 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8438833, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location provided excellent views", "disliked": "\u2014 Getting to town required a walk"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We've stayed at Brown's Wharf several times and always find it to be spotless and beautiful.
