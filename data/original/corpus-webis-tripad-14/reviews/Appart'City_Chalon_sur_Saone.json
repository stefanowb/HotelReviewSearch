I have stayed in other appatments in other ciites and this was reasonably comparable although smaller than most. It was very compact. I thought it was good value for money and the decor was modern and it was very clean. Less depressing than many independent French hotels which always look great on their website but which nearly always disappoint. The receptionist was not terribly helpful and could not provide us with a map of the city which was a shame as we have never visited Chalon Sur Saone before and didn't know our way around. It is very close to the train station but not to the actual city centre.", "title": "You get what you pay for", "user": "S_G_Taylor", "date": "August 28, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 138644066}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "This would have been a 3 or 4 but the breakfast was a joke. We were told that breakfast began at 8am and so we dutifully traipsed downstairs at 8 on the dot (thus delaying our preferred departure time). The breakfast room looked like a bomb had hit it. A coach load of Japanese tourists had just all FINISHED their breakfasts and it looked like a swarm of locusts had been through. It was messy beyond belief with food everywhere; table, seats, floor. To add insult to injury there was virtually nothing left to eat. Two girls did their best to clear up - very slowly - in a very gallic manner. No extra food was forthcoming. Breakfast was supposed to be served from 8 to 10am. There was just virtually no food left - not 1 single croissant. Just a couple of pain au chocolat and some brioche.", "title": "Worst experience ever", "user": "angrybirds5", "date": "August 24, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 138172843}], "location": {"country": "France", "region": "Burgundy", "continent": "Europe"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 4, "average": 6, "very good": 11, "terrible": 2, "excellent": 3}, "slim_ranking": 1.0}
