Mary, the innkeeper was gracious, accommodating, and simply put, exceptional. She attended to our every need while staying at her beautifully decorated, warm, and inviting inn. We went for my husband's 50th birthday and his flying lesson was canceled due to snow. Mary spent time giving us suggestions of different things to do in the area and turned what could have been a disastrous day into the weekend of a lifetime! When we came \"home\" Saturday evening to our utter delight she had even baked a three layer birthday cake for my husband! I cannot say enough good things about the Lyttleton Inn...the decor is wonderful...the rooms have so many little touches that set this Bed and Breakfast apart from others we have visited...from spring water to dark chocolate to even bath poufs in the bathroom...truly a home away from home.", "title": "On my way to Concord", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Ruth D", "date": "November 13, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 145319845}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Littleton"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 0, "very good": 4, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 32}, "slim_ranking": 1.0, "description": "The Lyttleton Inn is a newly restored B&B located off the Common in Littleton, Massachusetts.
