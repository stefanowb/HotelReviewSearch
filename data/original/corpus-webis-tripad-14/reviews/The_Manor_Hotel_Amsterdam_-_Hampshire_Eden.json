Our room was located on the street side, a bit of a concern due to traffic noise, but the windows were extremely well insulated, and you could barely hear the outside noise.

A large screen TV played mostly Dutch programming, but BBC, and SkyNews were available. The bathroom was modern and very clean. Some other reviewers noted the frosted glass door and the clear glass panels along either side of the bathroom mirror, allowing for peeping into the bathroom. This was not a major concern for us, but for strangers or more modest people sharing the room, it could be uncomfortable. The shower has no curtain, just a partial panel, so you have to be somewhat careful so as not to splash too much water around. There were plenty of shelves to keep toiletries and towels. An in-room safe in the closet came in handy for storing valuables.

I booked the hotel online and we got a fantastic deal for a 3 night stay with Booking.com. We travelled from the airport by public transport - train to Central Station and the number 9 tram to Liennaustraat when we were thankfully prompted by the tram driver that this was the stop for the Manor Hotel. Only a 2/3 minute walk to the front door, couldn't have been more perfect. The check in itself was easy the receptionist was very polite. I overheard the couple next to us being asked to specify if they would like a double bed, which they chose. We had booked a double bed so I didn't mention anything, however when we got to our room we had 2 twin beds pushed together. I rang down straight away but was advised I could only get a double bed if I upgraded as the category of room we booked they had no more double beds available. I did mention that I specifically booked a double bed and although the receptionist was sorry she could not accommodate us they were sold out of double beds. This was bad practice in my eyes overselling what you do not have to get the business in, but it was our first day away and I wasn't going to let this get to me. Over the course of the 3 days we used the hotel as our base for getting out and about and seeing the sites of Amsterdam. The hotel although is outside the centre is a great spot to navigate around the City. The Van Gogh Museum and Heineken Experience are only a few minutes tram ride away from the space and equally Dam Square is very accessible. We mainly dined and went out in Leidlesplein which had some great bars and restaurants and again only a few minutes tram ride away. Our Breakfast was not included and we didn't dine in the hotel as a result as we were mainly gone from the hotel each day, that said I had a quick peek at the menu and it looked nice. The hotel was a great choice for us, a good base and a friendly team.
