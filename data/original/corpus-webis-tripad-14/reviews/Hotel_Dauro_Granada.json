The freindly staff welcomed us, providing a comfortable room overlooking the busy street below but protected from the noise by thermopane windows while the valet parked our car in the garage below the building. This was expecially handy when one forgets something in the car.", "user": "CalTexTraveler", "date": "December 28, 2006", "id": 6509531}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Decent hotel for the price", "text": "The hotel is well located on a street filled with good places to eat and shop.
