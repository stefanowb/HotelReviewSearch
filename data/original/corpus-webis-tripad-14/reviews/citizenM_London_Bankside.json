Slick self service check in with staff nearby to help. Rooms are like most London hotels, small, but very very well designed. Huge bed for a small room (I'm over 6'3\" and I could sleep in any direction on it). Everything in room is controlled by samsung tablet which offers web browsing on the free wifi. Bathroom is small but well designed wet room with large showerhead. 5 minutes walk from Borough Market, London Bridge train station, london bikes very near, handy for tate modern, oxo tower, waterloo station.

The hotel was actually part of the fun rather than just a place to shower and sleep. Easy check in. Throughout the hotel they have gone out of their way to make it just a little bit different, the decor I think you would describe as \"retro\", but check out the pictures and decide for yourself. The room we stayed in was small but had all we needed. A big comfy bed, and lots of toys, We enjoyed playing with the lighting options. The shower/toilet pod is a little strange and.....how to put this delicately....it would be good to stay with someone you know well as it is not totally private. Moving on, Breakfast was excellent - buffet style. We only had a quick snack the day before that was good too, I enjoyed the Sushi. All in all good fun. Top tips? Car parking is expensive and limited, so public transport maybe better.
