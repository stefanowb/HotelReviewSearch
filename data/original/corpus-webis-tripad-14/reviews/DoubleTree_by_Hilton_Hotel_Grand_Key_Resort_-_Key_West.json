At the time we thought it was a pretty nice place. This was our first time back since then and we were expecting the same quality place. It was not what we had hoped for. This time around we both felt strongly that the hotel and grounds were fairly dirty. In fact, in six years the rooms looked exactly the same. I don't expect hotels to update their properties every year but everything looked the same right down to the comforters. Overall we just felt that it was a bit worn and dated. We also felt the first time when we stayed there that the property was a 4 star hotel but now it's somewhere between a 2 and 3 star property. On the bright side, most of the staff were very friendly and helpful. There was one guy at lunch that waited on us and it was excruciatingly slow. He also looked at us like he was a deer in headlights. Perhaps it was the language barrier, I don't know. One of the biggest turnoffs for us was a guy, who seemed liked a local, that would show up at the pool area bar every day and would undress into a thong. But it wasn't just a thong, it looked like a woman's thong. It was rather disgusting. I even heard other guests talking about him. It made me want to avoid the pool and pool bar altogether. Our other issue with the pool was the fact that locals would show up to use the pool. I understand that some hotels may charge locals a fee for a swim pass. However, in my opinion, hotel pools are for guests only. If locals want to swim, they should join a public pool. I pay to stay at the hotel. But it wasn't just that they were locals, some of the clientele at the hotel/pool just seemed dirty and ill-mannered. Sleeping wise, it got even worse. not only were there a couple power outages in the middle of the night which woke us up because the room felt like an oven but at 5 a.m. one morning there was a fire drill. We were NOT happy. I'm all for safety but 5 a.m.??? Ridiculous. I think the hotel is great for older folks that want to stay far away from Duval St. and only occasionally go there for a dinner before retiring to the hotel to go to bed at 9 p.m. But for a couple like us that likes to spend hours walking around town, shopping, having drinks/dinner, and taking in the culture, it's way too far. We rented bikes and it took us almost 30 minutes to ride the 4.6 miles into town from the Doubletree. The shuttle is fine but because the hotel is so far, we literally had to plan when we were coming/going and couldn't just head into town for a while and stop back. It was all or nothing. We rented a house one year near Duval with its own pool and we decided that it's the best option. We can swim for an hour, go out to lunch, stop back and swim again, and then shower and go out to dinner. At the Doubletree, we had to plan to be out for the day/night. There are other things like the elevator that seemed to have its own mind, but I think that covers it. We won't stay here again. We realize that for a little bit more money, renting a small 1-2 bedroom house in Old Town is the best option for our interests.", "title": "No Resort, 3 Star At Best", "user": "ardmoreflyer", "date": "April 1, 2011", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 2.0}, "id": 102448678}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2011, traveled as a couple", "text": "This hotel is very close to the Key West airport; not close to the downtown bars and Sunset celebration, but they have a hotel shuttle that takes guests to Mallory Square and another drop off every hour on the hour.
