However it is not particularly private if you want somewhere special for your honeymoon. We booked the deluxe honeymoon suite and were so disappointed. The door to our room was about 4 steps from reception and we could hear every voice quite clearly and I assume, vice versa. Bathroom was so tiny only one person could stand comfortably. Our room was situated on the ground floor and situated right in front of the main pool area. Everyone could see directly into our room. There were only heavy wooden shutters so if we wanted privacy and we closed them, it felt like we were in a cave. There were no wire screens on the doors so had to keep them closed too and use air-conditioning as there were mosquitoes. Could not get air-con temperature right so we were either freezing cold or being bitten by insects. .We only stayed three days but it really spoilt the last days of our honeymoon.", "title": "Not for Honeymooners", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Wombatgirl63", "date": "September 29, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0}, "id": 45370538}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Trip Advisor has done it again!
