They took our luggage right away and began to guide us through the labyrinth that is the massive Tokyo Station. The staff's English was very good and they were friendly and helpful. Once we checked in without a hitch one of the nice ladies who met us at the station escorted us up to our room and gave us a complete tour of the room's amenities as well as directions to best navigate our way in, out, and around the hotel.
