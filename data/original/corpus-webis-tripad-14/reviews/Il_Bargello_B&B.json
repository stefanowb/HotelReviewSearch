The location is unbeatable - only a five minute (or less) walk to the Duomo and round the corner from Il Bargello museum.

The walls are paper thin so we found ourselves whispering a lot and we never really felt \"at home\" here. The breakfast was usually cereal, oatmeal, and toast. It was enough to tie us through lunch and every morning Gabriella sat and joined us for breakfast. I'm sure it was an attempt at a nice gesture but the conversation was very awkward and we couldn't wait to get on with our day afterwards. We also felt as though we were punished once for trying to stop by the B&B in the middle of the day to drop off some of the items that we had purchased that day. My wife also had to use the bathroom as she had a little emergency. We were told that our room was not ready and that they need more time to prepare it. We had to insist that she needed to use the bathroom and we were just going to drop off the purses that we had purchased at the leather market so we wouldn't have to carry them around. If you've been to Florence you'll understand that it's a little difficult walking around with larger bags as the side walks are very narrow. We were trying to be nice about the situation but she seemed a little annoyed. There were several other strange scenarios but I'd rather not go into too much detail. This was certainly our least favorite B&B/hotel that we stayed at in our 2 week honeymoon trip.

I am so glad she did move us because the new room was absolutely great. Both rooms were extremely clean, but the second room had a wardrobe and a dressing table and much more space around us, which the first room didn't. The only downside to the B&B was that we could hear workmen outside our window from quite early in the morning. The road from one side of the B&B was closed due to work aswell (which has been going on for about 2 years apparently) but that didn't bother us as we always came in from the other end anyway. Breakfast is served round a communial table from 8am - 10am. It's best to get to the table early as one morning we couldn't get a place until gone 9am as all the seats were taken, which was ok but we liked to get out early.
