We planned our trip a few weeks ago online. We wanted a suite with two rooms to share for a reasonable price that was close to Bourbon Street. We came across this hotel and booked online. Afterwards we looked on trip advisor and were alittle scared due to previous reviews. We brought clean sheeys and towels and pillows as a precaution. To our wonderful surprise, we had not needed any of these things. The room was very nice and quaint. The staff was very friendly and helpful to our needs. It was quaint and actually very quite. There are two courtyards with pools that were very clean and it is a short walk to everything! My only problem was parking. There is only about 10-15 spots in garage. The other parking is across street and you have to wait for staff to open up the gates. Also, it cost extra 20 per night to park. Other than that it was wonderful!

The room was spacious, it reminded me of a small apartment. It did smell a bit funny. The couch was sunken in at the middle and a bit grungy looking. We couldn't turn the AC lower than 72 or the coils would freeze. The room was constantly muggy. I slept without the blankets. We were told the hotel had WIFI, but none of could connect and we had two laptops amongst us. The view was pretty, it made us forget about the hotel flaws. It was right into the larger pool area. I think the part that made me dislike the hotel the most was the area. There were three of us, all female and we got a lot of unwanted attention on our way to the French Quarters. The walk is very quiet and empty. Some guy cussed at us for not telling him \"hi\" among a few other creepy experiences with disrespectful men. The ad says it's just steps from the Quarters, which is true. What they don't tell you, is that it's the dark steps, the most empty area of blocks before you get to the actual areas where there are crowds. I don't hate the place, I just wouldn't stay there again. The hotel I really wanted was offering the same price ($129.00) for two nights, parking included.
