I chose it because the conference I was attending was held there, so it is out of convenience. My initial reaction after check-in was that of shock -- it was not like any hotel I stayed in, or any motel, for that matter! It was like a student dorm from back in the 1970's in the soviet block -- in fact this was what it was. However, after a week of stay, I must say that my experience was not too bad. It's clean, functional (except for the Internet), and since I only paid about $42/day including breakfast, it is what I should expect.", "title": "Not so bad after the initial shock", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "CanadianTraveller100", "date": "July 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 168566933}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The biggest problem is the Internet.
