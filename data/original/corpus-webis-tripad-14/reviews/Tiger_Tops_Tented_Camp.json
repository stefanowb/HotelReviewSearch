This was welcomed following our long drive from Pokhara, especially as it\u2019s another half an hour or so before you get to the tented camp. This journey is the start of the safari adventure: after a ten minute drive you hop onto a boat to cross the river and then you\u2019re in Chitwan National Park. Transfer onto an open top jeep and there\u2019s a 20 / 25 minute journey through forests, grasslands and rivers to our home for the next couple of nights. The guides are keen to show you wildlife even on the transfers. We arrived and then there\u2019s a five minute walk to the tented camp making you feel like you are right in the bush.", "title": "A great stay in the heart of the Jungle", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Samkirk9", "date": "April 23, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 28634460}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "There is a dining room / bar with a terrace overlooking the grasslands of Chitwan. You are quite high up which gives great views over the grasslands, and Rhinos can walk close to the camp. The tents are then spread over to the left and right of the dining area, all of which overlook the same grasslands. We were in tent number 1 which had views over a watering hole in the distance. This tent is also set on it\u2019s own (3 & 4 were next to each other). I\u2019ve read other not so positive reviews on here and don\u2019t really agree \u2013 the tents are great and comfortable, even more so than some of the hotels we stayed in. The beds are comfy, there\u2019s furniture in the tents to put things on, as well as an enclosed area for dressing / bags and beyond that there\u2019s a very nice bathroom. Water is provided in a flask and they even put a separate flask in the bathroom for you to brush your teeth. There are a couple of chairs and a table outside the tent for you to relax and take in the sights and sounds of the Park, although there are so many activities that there\u2019s little time for this. There\u2019s no electricity here, which is great, but you will need to make sure batteries are charged prior to arriving. Instead there are hurricane lamps, which are lit for you whilst you eat in the evening and your bed is even turned down for you.", "title": "The Great Wildlife", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "rxchiu", "date": "March 8, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 14150490, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff and variety of activities", "disliked": "\u2014 None"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The staff are very polite and informed and want to make sure that everything is comfortable for you.

It was a weird experience riding on the back of an elephant, slightly uncomfortable but it\u2019s a great way to see the grasslands, forests and rivers. The following morning we were driven to the Tiger Tops Lodge to pick up some other guests for our half an hour river trip, where we saw gharial crocodiles and not much else really. There is a jeep drive involved in this again where wildlife was pointed out. Early afternoon we had a talk about the elephants, and rather worryingly at first were able to get close to the elephants \u2013 we had a treat for them so they were well behaved \u2013 they are amazing creatures though.

We did see the usual \u2013 rhinos, wild boar, deer, peacocks, monkeys and lots of birds and butterflies. Our final activity was an early morning elephant safari, which was now rather more comfortable than the jeep. This was our last attempt at seeing a tiger, but again no luck.
