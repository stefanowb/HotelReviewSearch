The hotel is going for a kind of warehouse, war, prison feel. We booked late and so had to have a room with 3 singles instead of a double. Room clean but it felt a bit like a prison cell as there are no frills at all. Maybe other rooms are better. TV was very small and had very had reception. We shared a bathroom which was no problem at all, it seemed like we were the only ones using it.

When we mentioned these problems to the front desk we were met with polite condescension, as if these were mere corporeal concerns that could be transcended by plugging in our earbuds. Ice this scenario with an uncovered bulb in the ceiling and clamp on work lights for bedside reading and you have the perfect Portland cupcake; self absorbed, affected, cool only if your concept of cool includes discomfort.

We stayed four nights in a large room with sofa, comfortable bed, natural light and a turntable. At first we were a little taken back as it wasn\u2019t the resort style of the PS Ace hotel and swim club but more of a city hotel. The place worked out perfectly with some very cool attributes that force you to be social rather than hide out in your room and order room service. So our room was very much a retreat so in the morning put on Super tramp on the turntable and pull the day together. You have to go down to Stumptown coffee, Clyde Commons or out side for a smoke. So it forces you to engage Portland. The Hotel is close to the best restaurants and bars so you walk to everything.
