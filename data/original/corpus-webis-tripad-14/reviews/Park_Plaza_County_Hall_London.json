We then went back and got to our room, our cases were brought to the room for us. We had a great view of the London eye, which looks brilliant lit up at night. We then ordered room service for our 3 year old (as she slept while we went for lunch) she had fish fingers peas and chips, which was at the room within about 20 minutes, she enjoyed the meal too. That night we went to watch 'the lion king' show in Covent garden, we walked there and it only took about 15 mins (that was a slow stroll) and was a lovely walk over the Thames. Also, we pre-ordered our breakfast to the room ready for the next morning, which arrived right on the time we selected, it was yummy! As we had bed & breakfast included, it cost \u00a33.00 to get delivered to our room, I think this is reasonable as some hotels will rip you off with this service and charge up to \u00a315.00. Didn't use gym etc. as we were up and out by 9 and didn't get home until about 10.30 every night, so didn't really have time. Beds were extremely comfy, Bathroom was lovely and spacious, Nothing bad to say about hotel. Staff couldn't do enough for us. Christmas decorations everywhere which my daughter and partner loved, would definitely recommend! Also recommend London eye, aquarium, definitely a show in Covent garden, and Chinatown.

The only thing that let it down was the New Years Eve meal. It was supposed to be a gala buffet but there wasn`t very much selection. What there was of it was excellent. I would completely recommend this hotel for everything and would return there myself anytime.
