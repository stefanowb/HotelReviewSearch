The room (on the first floor) was gorgeous, really modern and nice and the furnishings were very comfortable. The only problem we encountered was the music coming from downstairs, which sounded like it was right next door. We werent sure if it was a one off party or a regular thing, but it was so incredibly loud that even with headphones in and my ipod turned fully up you couldnt drown out the noise. We called reception who advised that the band would finish at 1am, and offered to move us temporarily upstairs into a twin-bed room. At this stage it was almost midnight, and we doubted that it would be any quieter upstairs, so we stayed put.

Our bedroom was quite small and had a fit-out bathroom with a step up into it. The noise was incredible, as the street below was busy with cars, and being the summer, we had the windows open because of the heat. I found the breakfast a bit on the poor side. There was a poor selection of food, and especially the sausages were shrivelled up from sitting there for so long. On the plus side, we had lunch in the bar before we left, and we both thought our food was lovely, and good value. There was a small underground car park and parking was free.

I had pavlova, I was surprised after the fine meal we'd been served to find tinned fruit cocktail left on the plate beside a square of meringue, with raspberry sauce squished on top . A child could have made it. . When the young lady returned with our coffee she asked if everything was ok, I told her I was surprised to see the standard of dessert. Surely a bit of fresh fruit wouldn't be to much to ask for. She took my plate and returned a few minutes later with a five star dessert. A similar piece of meringue had a side of frsh fruit raspberry coulis and cream, with fresh strawberries. After the fabulous meal, the desserts just need tweaking....

As it was Tuesday morning we arrived down to an empty dining room. Only one other guest: Juices and milk were left out in jugs. Unfortunately both were room temperature, as breakfast started at 7. Chilled would have been nicer. Perhaps as there was so little guests and three service staff it could have been served to us fresh. Cereals were in individual boxes. There was crumbs all over the ttable in the area of the bowls... Again with so much staff on would it have been difficult to keep cleared away??? No place to leave the empty boxes other than in the way of the next guest. We had cereal with milk that was sitting on the counter long enough to be warm, accompanied by warm juice... We then proceeded to the hot food area. Were there was bacon sausages pudding hash browns beans mushrooms and tomatoes . All left out for self service.....They must have been there since 7, all exposed with no covers , they were all dried out and crispy and hard. The beans had a hard scum on the top. The bacon sausages and pudding could hardly be cut they were totally uneatable. We were served tea in a chipped tea pot. Surely with so little guests to cater for breakfast could have been cooked as required and not left too spoil for hours. We left without saying anything , but it left me dreading breakfast on the following morning. On returning to the hotel in the evening we had a few drinks in the bar. Again the staff were great super efficient and friendly . Day two and breakfast was surprisingly different. Same friendly greeting from the staff. Same warm juice. We had to ask for milk which was brought fresh and chilled to the table. The cooked food was so much better as it was covered with lids, at least it wasn't dried out.", "title": "Recommended", "user": "tighoriain", "date": "June 12, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 131802730}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights as part of a Newmarket tour of Donegal and The Giant's Causeway. We found the hotel to be very comfortable. The staff are helpful and friendly and go the extra mile. Nothing is too much trouble for them. They are all hard working and efficient and none of them stand around chatting. The meals we discovered are excellent value compared with other restaurants in the town. My sculptured fruit salad was a work of art and reminded me of the food we ate on a cruise to Norway 3 years ago. Everything was beautifully presented and the portions were huge! I felt my waistband tightening towards the end of our 4 day stay. The rooms were very clean and modern with laminated floors, comfortable furniture and a king size bed. The bathroom was state of the art with a wet room type shower. Toiletries were of a high standard but these were not replaces daily;. However, when I asked for extra toiletries this wasn't a problem and additional ones were provided. The staff are rightly proud of their Trip Advisor rating, which is displayed in the reception area. In my opinion it is rightly deserved. You get the impression that the staff work as a team and identify with the hotel, which is not always the case in all hotels. It was nice to see the owner also working hard over the busy Easter weekend in the restaurant and bar. The fact that so many local residents frequent the hotel on a Sunday night when entertainment in the form of a singer is provided and dancing takes place is a tribute to this hotel.
