From the moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and welcome drinks. All our request were followed through and our friends and us had adjoining rooms, king size beds and sea views, yes we were up on the top floor and up from reception so we did have a climb to our room but it was worth it for the views we had and we are not the fittest of people but we did the climb everyday and there is the shuttle car/van as well, so please don't let this put you off. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are tastefully decorated my husband had organised with hotel on arrival for flowers to be in our room for our wedding anniversary as a surprise and it was the biggest bunch of red roses I have ever seen 24 red roses layed on the bed as we walked in all for $30 australian. Rooms were clean and got cleaned everyday and loved the turn down service with orchids on the pillow every night. For my bday a cake was supplied Free of charge and it had candles and everything. The lady that cleaned our room was lovely and she went out of her way on many occassions and we had many jokes with her. The breakfast was outstanding and had a great variety loved the omelette with the works, and the pools were amazing and we got sun lounges not a problem around 11am at the second pool, though did see 2 chairs empty most of day with towels on them and when the people came for them about 2pm tipped the towel boy, so must have been holding them. Air con was great had found bed to be fine but it is a firm bed but thats what we prefer anyway. Overall staff were friendly and hotel was outstanding. Had a great time and over the merlin would rather stay here again for the value of money. Its only a 10-15 minute stroll to bangla rd and 150baht by tuk tuk.Hotel has plenty of activties to offer everyday and our hubbys enjoyed the pool games at 1pm down at pool three basketball etc there was 2 teams one guest and the other staff, they enjoyed themselves thoroughly while us ladies sun bathed. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone we had a a wonderful holiday that was made even better by staying here.

As this was our first time to Phuket we wernt really sure of what to expect. We arrived at the picturesque Novotel Phuket just after 11am and were greeted by the friendly staff who were very polite and helpful and welcomed us to the hotel. After check in was complete they assisted us with our luggage and drove us up to our room which was on a rather steep hill.Arriving at our room we were delighted with how it had been presented and the elegance of the decor. The room opened out to our own private balcony with stunning views of the Adaman Sea. Sadly the weather was not on our side which forced us to stay at the hotel more than what we had planned as it rained quite heavily during our time there , but the hotel has more than enough activities to keep guests occupied. I had come down with the flu due to the change of seasons and it was at this time was taught the fine art of Batik painting. The hotel offers thai cooking classes , thai boxing classes , aerobics , karaoke , and first class meals (if your not a pig and want to eat everything from the breakfast buffett at 10.15am in the morning , as the food has been sitting there since 6am for the early risers). The steps to the resort are a bit of a joke. I would not want to be treking up the 200+ stairs being elderly or with young children. you will find though that most of the time a TuK Tuk (taxi) is awaiting for a passenger near the hotel foyer entry carpark and are more than happy to take you into town and so as we did if we did go out made damn sure we had a tuk tuk to take us back and up the hill. The only annoyance out of the whole time we were at the hotel was the bed. It was as hard as a rock and we were close to tears by the 8th night as it was just so hard to sleep. The viewing on the television is a bit of a problem too. it was all either thai , mandarin or bbc world news - boring. All in all the hotel is lovely the staff are pleasent and helpful and the surrounds of the hotel are beautiful - well worth a stay it is truely value for money:)", "title": "Happy with the hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Stephen27", "date": "September 8, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 2.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 8677346, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beds"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "The beds are like slabs of concrete which is my only real complaint.", "title": "Nice but never again", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "PennyAnn50", "date": "August 28, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8524546, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Beds", "disliked": "\u2014 Beds and food"}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2006", "text": "I spent 6 nights in Novotel Phuket last year when I was spending my honey, we had a warm welcome as soon as we stepped into the hotel reception, we where offered a very nice complimentary drink and we checked in very fast, as soon as we stepped into the room I was very happy as they decorated the bed with beautiful flowers and the view from the room balcony was amazing.", "title": "I would love to go back", "user": "Fadwa", "date": "July 26, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 8237522, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 room, location, service, pool, view from hotel and restaurant", "disliked": "\u2014 nothing"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "Our next destination was Novotel Phuket. And we were very disappointed. The hotel staff was very rude at the time of the check in. they were straight to the point and did not even offer any friendly advice on how we could spend our time since we had arrived early. While we were checking in, there was another couple from Singapore who had a small baby with them. They were in a large group and the father of the child was requesting an early check in since the baby was cranky. The novotel staff and on duty manager were not giving the family a room a little early and demanding an extra from him. I appreciate the hotels desire to make money but felt that the hotel should grant an early room to the man since they were in a large group and they wanted only one of several rooms. We stayed in Novotel for one night and found the room dark and depressing. Since it was for one night (and $100 a night) , we did not complain and took our hired car for a spin around town phuket. The breakfast was as usual with the usual spread.

The room itself was ok it was supposed to be a sea veiw room but you had to stand on your tippy toes and crane your neck to glimps a little bit of the Andaman Sea! I had a massage in the Hotel spa and I must say it was below average also the cocktails at happy hour had little or no alcohol in them unless you stayed at the bar and watched them being made, hmmm, on that subject one of the staff manged to replace my duty free vodka with water, something I didnt find out til I arrived home.

I was very particular about the booking due to the bad experiences on 3 previous occassions with Accor at different hotels in different countries using the Accor (DIS) Advantages Card.
