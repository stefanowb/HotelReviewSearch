Not that the food was bad, the service is what ruined it. Our waitress was extremely slow, I think she forgot about us half the time. We weren't in any hurry or else I would have complained, but we probably sat there for a half hour after we finished our entrees before another waitress finally came over and grabbed our plates. And they weren't even that busy! I thought that was nice of her to cover for our horrible waitress, but then she just threw the dessert menus in front of us without saying a word and stormed off. Then we had to wait another 15 minutes for our other waitress to come back just to tell her that we were too full for dessert. We just wanted to finally get the bill and get out of there, but upon looking at it I realized that they overcharged us on our entrees and one of our drinks.
