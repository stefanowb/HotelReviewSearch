Been to this one about 6 times. Higher floors better view, but can be fine on even 2nd floor. One of the three elevators very erratic, comes to the floor and leaves without opening doors, can lead to waits. Weird they recently did remodeling of rooms, but left elevators 1980's with burned out bulbs. Last time was given room someone was obviously smoking in, but got that corrected. Can walk along bay, but really need car to get anywhere. They ought to rent bikes. $21 charge for parking, and all too often the gate doesn't read card right, or desk doesn't program it right and you find yourself pounding the call button for minutes. If that happens, go back to desk, get them to redo it, and \"ask\" for discount. Plane noise never a problem. Have never gotten room service, nor been to restaurant so don't know about them. Wifi always been fine for me. Pet peeve having staircases only exiting to ground floor with big \"emergency use only\" signs on them.
