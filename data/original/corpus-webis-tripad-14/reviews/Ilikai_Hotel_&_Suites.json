The staff was very friendly. While the hotel did offer free Wi-Fi, the ability to log on and do anything more than basic surfing/email checking was hit or miss. I tried to Facetime with some family on Thanksgiving Day and email a couple of photos (several times) and was unable to do either. The location is fine, the lagoon and beach is fine although we preferred to walk down the beach a bit for a less rocky area. Additionally, we chose to use the valet parking. Initially we were not excited about the $25/day cost and family members raved about the $10 spot they got at the Red Lobster down the street but after a day or two of walking to and fro and/or hunting for free parking it was universally decided that the convenience factor was well worth the cost.
