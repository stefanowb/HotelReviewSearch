My fianc\u00e9 had arranged for a bottle of wine to be put in our room for our arrival, and the staff was very helpful in arranging this. We arrived in Rome in the morning, so we went to the hotel to drop off what baggage we had (most had not arrived on our flight) and let us freshen up. The staff offered to call the airlines on our behalf to find out about our lost baggage, and when we returned later in the day, they reported to us that the airlines had no idea where our bags were! At least they tried. The staff also made lots of suggestions for us to help us plan our day. They let us store our bags the morning of the day we left so we could explore a little more of the city.

We had very high expectations from reading the Trip Advisor reviews. This property is in an ok position in the City, however, due to the very hot weather we found walking too far with our daughter not an enjoyable experience and took full advantage of the reasonable taxi service. Our room was modern with a double bed (2 singles together) and a separate bed for our daughter. The mattresses firm and ok but not madly comfortable. Ample wardrobe space and a spacious modern and clean bathroom. Bring your own travel kettle and supplies if you like tea/coffee in your room. I couldn't sleep at 4am due to the room being too hot, and try as I may I could not get the air conditioning unit to come on, so that was an uncomfortable night. Unlike most \"hotels\" there is no information booklet in the room. Personally we felt this would have been very helpful, certainly regarding the immediate area (restaurants, facilities, bus tours, metro etc). There is a recommended restaurant list at reception but it is under a glass top and not apparently available to take away. Unfortunately we were unable to connect our laptop to the WiFi, but there is free internet access for guests we used. We had a view of a side street and a fair amount of traffic noise from the nearby main road, especially during the week. Breakfast was a fairly basic continental affair. One morning there was a gorgeous fresh fruit salad, but that was the only day out of four we were there. Staff on the reception were helpful - some more than others, but no-one unpleasant.
