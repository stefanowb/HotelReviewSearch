We have stayed at Axel hotels in Barcelona and Buenos Aires. This hotel is not up to the same standard as the Barcelona and Buenos Aires properties. It is not interesting or exciting in any way. Unfortunately, it is dull and boring! The room we had was a junior suite, the \"Berlin Suite.\" It was large, but strangely configured, without being comfortable. It had more space for the dressing and closet areas than in the bathroom. There was a large tub, but a small stall shower. The shower leaked water through the shower door onto the bathroom floor, which was wet most of the time. The room attendants were late each day, which made it difficult to use the room until they arrived at 20:00 the first day to clean the room. The next day was somewhere around 16:00. There seemed to be an absence of people, both guests and hotel employees, at this hotel. The staff was mostly pleasant. Don't bother with the breakfast buffet unless you get it inexpensively. The computer for the business center has no printer. The wireless internet is insane! You need to re-enter a ticket number every time you enter the hotel to sign on each device. We had to sign onto the internet many times each day just on our iPhones. It was annoying. Each day, the ticket and password changes, so we had to call to the front desk or have them print a new one. The outside spa (hot tub) is in a small area, and is locked later at night. The access to the spa and fitness center is strange and cumbersome. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom area was very dark!! The vibe of the hotel is supposed to be hip and fun, but it is not hip or fun at all!!
