Upon checking in I enquired if the Sofitel chain was affiliated with either NWA or BA for frequent flier miles and the front desk rep had no idea. He did not volunteer to check on it for me either, just a simple I don't know. I would find it hard to believe I was the first person to ever ask about frequent flier miles but you never know.After we checked in our bags were not brought to our adjoining rooms like we were promised. Still more time wasted waiting for them. I was not given a key card for the outer door of our adjoining rooms, unfortunate for me I did not discover this till my friend and I split up to do different errands. The key kerfuffle was not handled well by the front desk...even more waiting while they got someone in security to make me the proper key. Around 1030PM Friday night I was awakened by Room Service entering my room. Apparently they had been knocking but I did not hear them ( the beds are very comfortable ). I did not think it was appropriate for them to just enter, especially when they had the wrong room. The coffee bar in the morning was nice. The last thing I did not appreciate was that on Sunday when I enquired about a late check out by 2 hours I was told NO, they had guests arriving that afternoon and needed the rooms ready by 3PM. That was interesting since it did not matter to them that I sat in the lobby about 2.5 hours on Friday due to late check outs. I have written well over a month ago to Sofitel Guest Relations with these and other concerns from my stay but they have yet to respond.

We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that I'm guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick. The bed felt \"broken down\" and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, it made airplane lightening look good. There were hand rails everywhere and two showers so we figured we were in a handicap room. The windows did not open and the room was stuffy and hot. We had to keep the air on high at the lowest temperature to make it comfortable. The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day. We thought that was a little odd for a king room. The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top. I guess I had expected more since we had booked this reservation months in advance. The clock radio was not a CD player and it didn't pick up one station. The location is miserable if you are looking for any food or toiletries. We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot. The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station. Be advised the subway station does not open before 7:15 a.m. on Saturday. The White House is about two blocks from the hotel and you certainly can't see it from the hotel. With the subway system you are not far from anything in this town regardless where you stay.
