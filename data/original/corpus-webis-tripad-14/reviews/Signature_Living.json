It was, without doubt, one of the best short breaks we have been on. We travelled by train and found the apartments without any difficulty - about 5-10 mins away from Liverpool Lime Street Station. The apartment was immaculately clean and spacious, very central for all things whether it be shopping, eating, drinking or sight seeing. Mary of Signature Living was very informative and even booked us a reservation at a restaurant, which saved us 20% - thank you. The weather was quite warm while we were there and the bedroom in particular was quite hot but Signature Living even had that under control - a fan was already in the room for guests use - a great touch as was the basic provisions provided. We were very impressed by Liverpool and its people. We were always greeted by a friendly smile or hello no matter whether it was in a shop, visitor attraction or restaurant. Nightlife was available but there were few people out as we did visit at the beginning of the week - by the weekend, the nightlife would, I bet be buzzing - there was definitely something for every age group. We are already planning a second visit for later in the year and have recommended Signature Living to my family and friends.", "title": "Short break made even better with fantastic accommodation", "user": "birdsbird", "date": "July 8, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 70129796}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "Thank you for an excellent stay in your apartment.
