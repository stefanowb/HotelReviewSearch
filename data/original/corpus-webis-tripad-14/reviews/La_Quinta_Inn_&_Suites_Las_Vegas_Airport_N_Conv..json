It is a good stay for the price. The interior is nice, bathrooms are somewhat older (towels are quite old), but the nice free breakfast makes up for it. Breakfast included waffles, sausages, hard boiled eggs, banana and apple, yogurt, cereals and oatmeal, juices, and bagels, bread and danishes. Bagels and danishes were individually wrapped so we were able to grab breakfast to go when we headed for the airport. The property had ample parking and was a very easy drive to the airport and the Strip. It is across the street from Terrible's Casino's Bougainvillea Cafe where we ate dinner a couple of times. To tour the Strip, we drove about 3 blocks to Bill's Gambling Hall and Saloon and parked there for free so everything was quite convenient. We never leave valuables in hotel rooms so theft was not a problem. This property should appeal to the budget-conscious traveler.

We had planned this trip together for several months, to include booking this hotel well in advance. A few days prior to our reservation, I called the front desk to seeif it would be possible to arrange that our friends be able to check in on their arrival from their flight from D.C. (we were driving from California and wouldn't be able to arrive until much later). When I called, I was told this would not be possible as they would need to verify credit card info and id, even if the room was paid for in full prior to our arrival, and to be sincere, the courtesy on the other end of the line was very minimal; I felt as though I had interrupted them and did them a diservice simply by asking. I was not surprised that this could not be arranged, but I was completely surprised that when we finally did arrive and I did check in at the front desk, I was not asked for a single form of identification, no credit card, nothing.

That in itself was no big deal, however, the shuttle was very advertised as 24 hours, convenient, etc., but this couldn't be further from the truth. In order to use the shuttle, which ran on no organized, consistent schedule, you had to notify the front desk who then contacted the shuttle driver via nextel walkie cell phones, and then you waited 10-15 minutes at the hotel to get on the shuttle.

The driver and hotel well advertised the fact that the shuttle would stop running at 5pm that evening. What they DID NOT include was that at 2pm-something, a shift change would occur. We called the hotel from the strip at 2:28pm to request the shuttle and were told in the same less-than-courteous manner that we should call back AFTER 3pm to re-request a shuttle because they were in the middle of a shift change. No apology was given; and the fact that we would have to recall the hotel and then again wait for the shuttle, it would have definitely been an hour before we would be back at the hotel, a mere 5 minute drive. We instead had to take a taxi. No big deal. We were happy to be in good company. However, the next day, New Year's Day, we spent the day on the strip and requested a shuttle at approximately 4:40pm and were quoted a half hour wait. We had a dinner reservation we were planning around, so when 45 mins passed, we called again, at which time we were told that the shuttle had been waiting at the airport. There were supposed to be 2 shuttle running, but they were only using one. When the driver did arrive, he offered no apology and commenced driving in such an erratic manner that those of us in the van were actually bracing on turns and accelerations - and I promise this is not an exaggeration.", "helpfulness": 17, "user": "rattmoney", "date": "October 16, 2005", "id": 4027249}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Clean and Good Service!", "text": "The next day, our key stopped working, which we didn't find out until our walk to the breakfast room, and we couldn't open the door to the main part of the hotel.
