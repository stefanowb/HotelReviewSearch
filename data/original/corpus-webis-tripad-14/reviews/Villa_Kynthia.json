Panormo is a small and largely unspoilt fishing village, with a nice beach and a good selection of restaurants, cafes and bars. And Villa Kynthia, which has been beautifully restored by a welcoming sister/brother team, is an absolute delight. We had the middle-sized room of the five (Pandora) and that was quite spacious, so the bigger ones must be enormous. The small pool was very welcome on hot days. And breakfasts in the courtyard, under a spreading pine tree, made a perfect start to each day.", "title": "A delightful guest house in a lovely village.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ptk13", "date": "June 14, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 113383963}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "Villa Kynthia is in the centre of Panormos, a fairly quiet seaside village.

It has a balcony with small table & 2 chairs that overlooks the street which is reasonably quiet, but beware of the refuse truck that arrives when it's still dark! The best thing about the villa is the courtyard, an oasis of peace & quiet where most guests congregated at the end of the evening without intruding on their fellow guests. It is not a hotel - the reception is not manned, but a lovely greek lady serves the breakfast each morning between 8.30 & 10.00, & is there to serve ouzo, wine etc from 20.00-22.00 in the evening, but as long as you understand it's a guest house, this isn't really a problem.", "title": "Very good guest house - not a hotel", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "jan59Essex", "date": "September 28, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0}, "id": 45327261}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2009, traveled on business", "text": "Villa Kynthia is a renovated Villa, perfect to have relaxing holidays, a magical environment, that makes you feel like home!

It is a gem, offering the perfect mix of small, friendly, non corporate, characterful, with pool, in the heart of a quiet, relaxed village/ small town with plenty of tavernas and no here we go element. villa kynthia has such a pretty private courtyard for breakfast and enjoying while lazing by the pool. We also had pre dinner drinks there each night which were reasonably priced and delicious, it meant we could enjoy the place in the evening too. The welcome and service was spot on from emails before arrival throughout. We took the smallest room and it was modest but pretty and the bathroom being over the hall was never a problem. Only thing is the bed was so hard it was uncomfortable. We stayed at a second hotel in Crete during this trip and that bed was the same so maybe that's how they are in Crete? A definite downer for us but that's subjective. I have not given it full marks for value because i think it is expensive for a relatively simple place, particularly given our room was not luxurious. But, that said, i did love it and will pay more for such a nice pace. Both villa kynthia and panormos are highly recommended by me! We thought the village was a lovely spot for families as the beaches were small and felt safe. We went in late June and it was pretty quiet - all v relaxed and friendly.", "title": "Gem of a place", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "AlYorks", "date": "August 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 136200841}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "This lovely hotel has the feel of an intimate country b&b, a feeling that is backed up by the warmth and friendliness of its owners, Korinna and Andonis.

Ample storage is provided by a large wardrobe and chest of drawers as well as bedside tables and the walls are decked with artful pictures.

The house is attractive, with spacious, clean rooms: our first night was in Rea which is good for a family. It's a bit dark, but very comfortable with all mod cons, and a small, a bit tired, bathroom. The 3 other nights we stayed in our first choice, Pandora on the first floor which is perfect for a couple. It has a private small terrace with sun loungers (in shade in the afternoon) and a lot of room. The bathroom is also quite tired and a bit smelly (damp/drain). The ground floor terraced area is very pleasant to have breakfast and relax except that when we were there there were two extremely rude British families with demonic young children who run around screaming and throwing things at all times, making relaxing in this nice outdoor area impossible.
