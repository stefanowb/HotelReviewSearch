We had visited the hotel twice before to swim but not as hotel guests. Upon our arrival I had to flag down someone to assist with our luggage. Initially the guy who assists with calling taxis aided and ultimately we located a bellhop. I always find it a bit of a shocker to have to walk through a metal detector especially one with security officer and his dog. I guess however they are concerned with terrorism and mayhem. So we sauntered through and proceeded to check in. Check in was flawless, quick and professional. We received our room keys with a smile.

Finally deciding to eat I had the bright idea of using the hotel ATM machine as opposed to getting the night's cash at the mall (Ayala is right down the road). This was the only sore spot of the evening, though momentary and fleeting. The ground floor ATM was off limits I was informed by a staffer due to an event (wedding) with the second located in PAGCOR (second floor). I was refused entry due to wearing a sleeveless shirt despite informing security of my sole desire to use the ATM. Discussion with the security officer and his supervisor was met with polite but firm refusal. Getting a tad bit annoyed by there unwillingness to even consider thinking out of the box. I reported this silly rule to the first floor Guest Relations Officer who informed me that a report would be generated to the duty manager and we were allowed to proceed to the event hall", "title": "Expensive for what you get... but good band at night.

The price is very expensive even with breakfast included. There was no free wifi which is a basic standard even for 4 star hotels which this did not offer. I could only get wifi in the main foyer which was again expensive. The only main issue I had was I was out with my female friend coming back to the hotel and the hotel staff stopped me and thought she was a hooker or something. I kept telling them it was my friend locally who would be attending the wedding. This ruined my whole week there as the room was booked for 2 adults and I was the only person staying.
