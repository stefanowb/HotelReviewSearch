We did both; the hotel was ok...pricey...and Anthony's was really good for pizza and wings. The hotel was very clean, our room was very well cared for, clean and room to move around in! We parked our car in their covered garage for the duration of the cruise at a $7.00 per day charge. All personnel were courteous and helpful.
