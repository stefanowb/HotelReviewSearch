I started camping here when my middle daughter was 6 months old, There were never any activities in this park. I worked their water slide until it collapsed and they weren't allowed to put it back up. This park needs a serious face lift which I think they are starting. If it is like anything else they do it will take a few years to get it done. This will or should not be listed as a family campground, if you are seasonal you will not be allowed to leave toys on your site.

As I was told everything is for sale for the right price. But they will have to get a lot of money because John and Mike will be out of a job and have never done anything else.

That said, I was not happy with certain things (buyer beware). We made reservations 6 months in advance for a \"good\" site. I confirmed a month prior. I pull in at 8:00 pm and they had NO reservation! They had this huge board with labeled sites, our reservation was nowhere to be found. We had to go in one site and move to another the next day. Not happy. They don't have or use a computer. If you even want a confirmation you need to send them a self addressed stamped envelope????? You're kidding right? With that I proceeded to pay. They list this as a family campground right, but rates are based on only two people???? Who are you kidding. The 58.00 rate went up to 70.00 plus tax! That's right, they charged me 4.00 per day per night for all 3 of my kids! If you need to do any business using wi fi, they advertise wifi but it won't reach your campsite. You need to sit within 500 feet of the office. They have no other hotspots. Even with losing our reservation, there was no \"comp\" for anything. Two days into our stay, I had a gentleman approach me telling me I was in his spot. They seemed to again mess up a reservation. Unfortately he did not get the site he reserved either (as I was now in I). The pool was nice but unseasonably cold for August and too lose to the highway for me. The trolley to the ocean was nice for those who don't tow a car. All in all, it's a place to stay that's two miles from the beach.", "title": "Nice but few FYI's", "user": "alwaysprn", "date": "August 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 170502425}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Old Orchard Beach"}, "variance": {"poor": 5, "average": 5, "very good": 2, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 5}, "aka": "Old Orchard Beach Campground Maine", "slim_ranking": 0.4}
