Although this was adequate to check email and send messages to others back in the states. You can also book trips and also get tickets to events or the red bus that will take you around London at the front desk, a time-saving option. Earl's Court station is only a few minutes walk from the hotel, and it is very easy to travel via the underground to get to many of London's attractions. It would have been nice to be a little closer to the historical district near Westminster, though I'm sure this would come with a much larger price tag. Located right down the street are a few pubs such as the Blackbird and also the Courtfield although they did close early (like 11 or 12). The Courtfied seemed a little more lively, was open later and I think just overall I had a better time there as it had a different vibe, Blackbird had good bangers and mash. Overall the area was very nice and we could tell the neighborhood was upscale, as we saw maserati's in driveways and an aston martin just parked on the street. One mistake we did make was that we didn't buy the London Pass, I feel like we would have seem more sites if we did, as the cost of each individual site really added up with how strong the pound is to the dollar, look into the London Pass.", "title": "Excellent", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "rnish", "date": "June 28, 2011", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "service": 5.0}, "id": 114848619}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2011, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed for a family vacation, 2 adults and 2 kids, we rented 2 separate rooms.
