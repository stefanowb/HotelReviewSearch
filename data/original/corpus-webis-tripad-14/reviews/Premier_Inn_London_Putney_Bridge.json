We booked a family room which by some arbitrary standard is 2 adults and 2 children (Under 16). At check in we were told we had to book another room as one of our children was 18 years old. There was no argument that was the rule. We booked another room for our child at 175 pounds for two nights. We got to our family room and it was huge with ample room for our family. I was not happy.
