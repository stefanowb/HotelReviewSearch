I made our reservations in January for two rooms with king sized beds. I was told there would be no problem. When I called to confirm our reservations the day before we were to leave, I was told we had two rooms each with two double beds instead of the King beds I had originally requested. After speaking to 3 managers, including the general manager, we were given one king sized bed and the other room would still have two doubles. I couldn't understand how one minute we were told there were no kings available and now all of a sudden we were given a king. The general manager was very rude and did not care about the situation I was now in. We were meeting 30 people for a concert and about 12 people were to stay in this hotel. After going back and forth and the general manager not caring and fixing the problem, I finally cancelled our reservations, which I'm extremely glad I did. The other people who stayed in this hotel had nothing but problems. Dirty rooms, bathrooms and tubs that did not drain properly. And ofcourse the managers didn't care about these problems either. We did stay at the Hyatt Regency in the Arcade, what a wonderful stay!! Treated like royalty. Because of the horrible treatment we received from the Radisson, I will stay away from all Radisson hotels. We will be going back to Cleveland again with the same people and you know we will NOT stay at the Radisson.
