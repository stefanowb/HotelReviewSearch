We arrived in the early hours and were amazed to find that although we had booked 2 twin rooms we actually had 2 mini suites. Each had 2 rooms and a bathroom and one had its own kitchen. One balcony was shaded and had no view but the room more than made up for that. As I travelled with my 13 year old son and 70+ parents the accomodation suited us perfectly. The staff are amazing. Reggie and Torro were great with usall and kept us laughing all week. Mehmet, the manager runs a tight ship and is very helpful. Drinks are reasonably priced, and there are no hidden extras. We had a meal on our last night and wish we had eaten there earlier in the week, the food was sensational. We had a long wait for the coach and Mehmet sat with us keeping us entertained. He even provided us with water for our journey free of charge. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the pool area is lovely. Try the Turkish night if you stay here...the belly dancers made a real fuss of my son and had us dancing on the bar. The blue lagoon is a great place but try Sugar Beach which is owned by the Help bar. They run a free bus and the food isgreat. I had a holistic masage on the beach there which was so relaxing. A great bar to eat in is Park bar near the bus and taxi stop. Ishmail and his team had us laughing constantly. Overall this hotel cant be beaten and we will definately be back next year", "title": "Best holiday ever!", "user": "annietravelnorth", "date": "September 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 44906778}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "we arrived at this hotel early hours of the morning, we were shown to our room which was room 208 on the ground floor near reception, this room was really small and dark, I went straight to reception and asked them for a room change, there was no problem but we had to wait until after breakfast. our second room was brilliant, on the top floor overlooking the pool and the sea in the background, the rooms are decent size, very clean with power shower.

We arrived very early in the morning (4.00am) and was shown to our room by a man who appeared to be somewhat sleazy. There was a rug on the floor that was full of stains. Upon inspection of the bathroom we found that the shower was broken and was full of black bacteria (obviously wear and tear from the previous residents that season, but nothing the management couldn't have fixed in 2 minutes and the maid couldn't have cleaned with bleach). The towels had holes and smelled dirty. We also noticed that the towels hadn't been changed for 3 days so we had to asked for clean ones! The maid would lift the towels off the floor and hang them on a washing line on the balcony! The bedlinen also had the same smell as the towels and a couple of stains. Apart from that the room was basic, but fairly clean with a fridge and TV and good storage space which looked fairly new and modern. Breakfast is awful. The juice that tastes like lemsip, there was cheese, olives and tomatoes and leftovers were covered up with clingfilm and put out for guests the next day but the bread was fresh. I can't comment on other food or drink as we stayed on a B&B basis, however, if the breakfast was anything to go by - I suggest others do the same. The hotel was quiet as it was the end of the season, but staff were not. They played their music loudly in the bar at night (and watched the football) until the early hours of the morning so it was difficult to get to sleep. However, if you are out and about for most of the time like us and are just using the room as a place to sleep, the hotel is fine for that purpose, but we got the feeling that staff just didn't care as it was the end of a long season and just wanted to shut up (the season ends at end of October so we were there the second last week). The rest of the resort is nice but it certainly isn't the bargain that some would have you believe. There is tourist prices and local prices. Everything - including food and drink - is over priced with a small beer in some places costing 6 Turkish Lire (approx \u00a33 for half a pint!) And it is like this all over the tourist resorts and the tourist destinations. Trips are good value for money if you book independently but some of our guides just could't be bothered (especially one who called himself Psycho) as it was his last trip of the season and was going home the following day - he seemed more interested in telling us about himself rather than the history of the destination we were going to. Overall, we did have a good holiday and I suppose some problems in a country relatively new to tourism is to be expected, but just because it is the end of the season does not mean that tourists who visit at this time should be treated any differently - but they are.", "user": "andare", "date": "October 28, 2009", "id": 47948040}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "On arrival at this hotel we were pleasantly surprised. The location is good and the hotel is generaly clean and comfortable, although the bedding was old and in some instances full of holes. However it was clean. Unfortunately after only 2 days we began to have problems, on ordering lunch of spaghetti with mussels, it arrived minus the mussels. When we asked why no mussels we were told they were out of season. We then asked why they had not told us when we ordered and were told that they had given us spaghetti with tomato sauce so what was the problem!! We then discovered that mussels were available in other restaurants and also on the beach. On day 3 there was not melon available at breakfast, again we were told that it was out of season, although we had it for the first two days and all of the shops, and other restaurants had melon available. They had no ice creams at all and if we wanted ice cream they had to run to the local shop for it, similarly with crisps or any other type of snack. If we ordered pizza for lunch we had to wait up to 1 hour whilst they went to another hotel to get it as it was \"end of season\" In conversation with one member of staff we were told that the manager was afraid of having any leftover stock, but bearing in mind that there was still 3 weeks of the season left this was rediculous. The final straw was when they said they only had 6 bottles of coke left and hardly any beer. God help anyone arriving there in the last week.", "title": "Hotel is O.K.
