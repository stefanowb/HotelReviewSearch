A fantastic location, rooms and the rest of the hotel were kept spotless, and the walk through to reception, especially if arriving after dark is pretty special. We also had lunch down by the pool a couple of times during our stay and that was excellent as well as being more favourably priced than some of the restaurants outside of the hotel. We took a walk up Montana Roja (an inactive volcano) on one of the cloudy days, went snorkeling, hired a pedalo and I went on an excursion with magma bikes canarias which are just situated around the corner. That was fantastic exploring Papagayo on a mountain bike with a very informed guide although my backside the day after thought differently. Definitely recommended for anyone interested in seeing the area- they also do walking tours too and have a stall on the twice weekly market.", "title": "Great holiday", "user": "Lolly85", "date": "October 18, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 181437405}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "There were just one or two tiny things that stopped the holiday from being even better.

This isn't the case here as there was everything you could wish for both at breakfast and evening meal. From cold meats and yogurt to the full English at breakfast to five or six salad choices and freshly cooked fish and meat at night time- the choice was exceptional. The difference compared to last year was that there appeared to be fewer waiters and waitresses employed which meant in quite lengthy delays in getting coffee in a morning and, to a lesser extent, drinks in the evening.

The hotel is located just 10 km from the Timanfaya National Park, 900 metres from the picturesque fishing village of Playa Blanca, where you will find shopping centres, bars and restaurants, and just 30 minutes from the International Airport of Arrecife. Andr\u00e9s Pi\u00f1eiro, the chief architect of the project, chose a design based on a complex of classical buildings that are a true reflection of the typical architectural style of the island. The design of the hotel is reminiscent of a typical village of Lanzarote, with romantic patios, traditional courtyards and secluded spots, together with the magnificent hotel entrance which is a replica of the Teguise church of \u201cNtra. Sra. de Guadalupe\u201d. With its unique architecture and the distinguished service of a luxury hotel, the Hotel Volc\u00e1n Lanzarote is an icon within the high end segment of the tourism sector."}
