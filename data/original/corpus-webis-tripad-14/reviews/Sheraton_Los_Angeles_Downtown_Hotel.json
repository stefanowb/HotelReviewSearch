Our admin assistant booked the room for me and was quoted a government rate, even though we are not a government agency.

After working and traveling across the country, I went to check in and was told that I do not have a government ID and could not check in with that rate. I had to pay TRIPLE the cost for every night. I spoke to Jun or June, the night manager, who repeatedly tried to demean by saying, \"you have to show your government ID.\" He kept saying it as if I were an idiot. I explained repeatedly that I did not make the booking and they should honor the rate. Jun gave me an AAA discount. I then decided to cancel the remainder of the reservation and stay only one night. It was VERY unpleasant and I did not appreciate the unprofessional manner in which this was handled. Once checked in, I called the corporate office, but it was already after hours.

It coast us a whopping $28 to self-park the car at the hotel. Ouch! And, as usual with Starwood properties, internet was not free. No refrigerator. No microwave. My overall perception of this room was that many things in the room were worn-looking. For example, some of the caulking in the bathroom needed replacement and the ceiling need to be repainted. The controls for the air conditioner were incredibly outdated. To make the room more \"warm\" or \"cool\" I slid a lever from left to right. No digital thermostat here.... I had to guess how far to move the lever. On the up-side, the bedding was clean and the mattresses were very comfortable. The bathroom was free of mold and the drains worked well. When we booked the room the only option was a king sized bed for my friend and I, but upon arrival the friendly attendant at the front desk was able to change it to a room with 2 doubles. There was Starbucks coffee and tea in the room. Under the work desk there was a power strip where we could plug in multiple things, like phone chargers. That was really nice. Another comment is that our room was next to the elevator, but we didn't hear any noise. The whole floor was very quiet. We were on the 18th floor, which required a short wait for the elevator.

I had stayed at the Westin Bonaventure in September and they were charging around 30 per night. The front staff was pleasant. The rooms were clean, however, somewhat dated. The HAV was located above the beds which was a little odd. The fear that something would fall on your head(which would not happen for real) made it not so comfortable. The rooms were clean and fresh but the small details were off. The outlets were all from the 1970's. They had yellowed with time and the HAV control seemed to come from the same era. The bathroom was normal in size, tub was the old ceramiccoated steel, tiles were relatively new. Fixtures were of a standard grade. Overall the room was very comfortable, but nothing that would warrant anything memorable.
