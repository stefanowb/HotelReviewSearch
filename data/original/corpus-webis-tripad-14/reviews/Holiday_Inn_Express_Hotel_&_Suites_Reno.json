The one downside is that the location is right off the freeway so pretty loud traffic noise, and it's in an industrial area so there is absolutely no greenspace or greenery to be found on the hotel property or even nearby. Kind of hard on the pooch. The breakfast was solid with a decent amount of healthy choices alongside the cinnamon rolls, pancakes and bacon. The swimming pool is small but very clean.

While I typically prefer to stay in a local place instead of a chain, I was swayed by the TripAdvisor reviews. They are fair and on point. The Holiday Inn Express, Hyatt Place, and the like, are all more-or-less the same type of express hotel with minimal service, and I imagine their rooms are comparable. Unfortunately, they are not located in great areas. There's nothing wrong the industrial automotive park that HIE sits in the middle of, across the highway and across from the airport. It's just not quaint or local, kind of generic, and one could be anywhere -- there was nothing \"Reno\" about this hotel or its location.
