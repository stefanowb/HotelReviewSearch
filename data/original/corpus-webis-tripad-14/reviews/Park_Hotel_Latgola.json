We arrived at the hotel and the receptionist was very friendly and helpful with parking and directions information. We had booked a suite but it wasn't available when we arrived but they gave us a business class room instead. This was very basic and the carpet was stained. However it was clean. The best thing about this hotel was its location and friendliness of the reception staff. The bar area was good but the bar staff couldn't cope with the amount of guests arriving for the speeday and were sometimes rude.The worst thing was the breakfast . They had carrots peas and cauliflower and frankfurters. They ran out of coffee and bread. It was horrid. I would suggest that they update their rooms with a bit more luxury and get a new chef !
