The meals at the rest of my table appeared substantial, padded out well with chips, and I heard few complaints from the group I was with, apart from the fact that for basic pub meals, the prices were fairly expensive. However, I ordered Squid with Greek Salad and was really looking forward to a nice Greek Salad: fetta, olives, tomato, lettuce, onion and cucumber. What could be so difficult about that? When it came it was all lettuce! I paid $20 for lettuce, three olives, a thin slice of cucumber, a quarter of a smallish tomato, about four very very thin onion rings cut in half, and six to eight squid rings. The waitress came up to the table and asked how we enjoyed our meals. Everyone else said okay, good etc as you do; I said that I wasn't happy with my meal as it was a very poor Greek Salad and all lettuce. She wasn't expecting this and obviously did not know what to say. I asked her to pass it on to the chef. I did not ask for my money back. I was not rude about it. When she finally came back to the table to collect our plates, I asked her if there was any response from the chef. She said no, they were too busy..... So then, why do waitresses ask if you like your meal? I ate my husband's leftover chips to compensate for the lack of sustenance.", "user": "larnie1950", "date": "July 2, 2012", "id": 133217030}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Visited June 2012", "text": "I was very disappointed.
