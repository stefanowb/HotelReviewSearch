The rooms were clean and nice (I didn't think they felt cheap like other reviews have stated). The hotel was very busy while we were there and the staff was disorganized. They were very pleasant and accommodating, but simply seemed unable to handle the volume of traffic. Although the lobby offered a nice selection of free coffee, teas and treats, the supplies often ran low and their automatic coffee machine ran dry all morning. One note about the location: this hotel is east of the main tourist zone and is in the financial district. It's in a clean and safe location with great underground/subway access. But, as with all things in London, even the underground is expensive and takes time. We were there on a bank holiday weekend and were forced to walk a fair distance before finding any selection of open restaurants.

Another plus is the wonderful staff, who are courteous, informed, and eager to assist. Nothing to fault there. The iffy and big downside to Club Quarters Gracechurch are the rooms themselves and the general aesthetics of the hotel itself. The rooms, even the \"suites\", are small, and the decor theme, green carpets, walls, and dark wood, make the rooms feel dark and claustrophobic and dingy -- not pleasant. The bathrooms are cramped, the fixtures basic and utilitarian, it all feels cheap. And even when traveling on business an hotel room is not just \"a place to sleep\", especially when the bed is hard to sleep on, as these beds are very much on the firm side. The rooms do nothing to lift the spirits. Even the hallways give you the feeling of being in a labyrinthine hostel. The theme of the dark extends to the restaurant, Gaucho, which is in the basement and painted black! The upside there is that the breakfast is quite decent, and the coffee good. Try to ignore the throbbing disco music at 7:30 a.m. Given the great staff and location, Club Quarters would benefit from a real re-design and refit, as it has the potential to be vey good.", "title": "Great location, great staff, iffy accommodation", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "timotao", "date": "June 2, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 162702836}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed May 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The hoter was very nice staff were very helpful and polite.

Filtered water in the lobby and on every floor by the elevator. Breakfast cereal bars, fresh fruit in the lobby. It's relatively high-end, without frills, but they thought of everything. It was not a personalized experience, but more than adequate, and at a high level. Like a 5-star, hi-tech hotel. Large work-style desk in the room, excellent wi-fi, with interesting books on London on the desk along with a dictionary and thesaurus.
