The hotel is right across from Fountain Square Plaza in the middle of downtown, within easy walking distance to a number of good restaurants, both casual and upscale. The first miss: when I arrived in a taxi the doorman, who was chatting with a customer, couldn't be bothered to come over and help me with my luggage. Seems to me that's a pretty basic part of a doorman's job. I was left to get my luggage and enter the building wondering where reception is--turns out you have to take the escalator upstairs.", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "jack783", "date": "February 25, 2012", "id": 125180132}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2011, traveled on business", "text": "Things went better from there--the lobby is beautifully done and modern. Reception checked me in quickly and even upgraded me slightly to a room overlooking the Fountain for being a Starwood Gold member. But the room itself was the second miss: while spacious, it's definitely showing its age and is a stark contrast to the lobby downstairs. The faded carpeting and wallpaper makes the room old, especially since I noticed a patch of ripped wallpaper in an obvious place near the bed. The wooden desk and dresser look cheap and are chipped and gouged in multiple places. And a panel above the closet door was gone, so you could see into the closet. The room did have a good flat screen TV, coffee maker, small fridge and room safe and the bed was comfortable but overall I've seen nicer rooms in Courtyards and other lower budget hotels. On the plus side, I had a problem hooking up to the room internet and tech support went out of its way to help me right away.
