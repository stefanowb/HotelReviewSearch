It was a little far from the center of town, but the route was well marked, so walking wouldn't be very difficult. One of the teachers on our tour went running one morning and made it to the center of Avignon and back in 25 minutes. The hotel itself was made up of about eight cottage-style rooms, with separate rooms on the top and bottom floors. We stayed on the bottom floor, and our room was fairly nice. It was roomy, and had a couch and kitchenette. The bathroom was okay, but the shower was temperamental and occasionally decided to douse you with icy-cold water, and then five minutes later, return to its hot temperature. Some of our friends had an upper-floor apartment, and it looked nicer than ours. The upper-floor ones actually have two floors, with a double bed room at the very top and a balcony. Even though we didn't know the price of the hotel because it was included in our tour, the ones listed on the gate of the hotel seemed quite reasonable (see picture). All in all, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to save money, because not only did the rates seem inexpensive, but you would have a kitchenette, so you could shop at the markets and make yourself meals fairly cheaply.", "title": "Cute cottage-style rooms, 30 minute walk from Avignon", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "dogbone1002000", "date": "March 27, 2009", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "location": 3.0, "service": 4.0, "rooms": 3.0}, "id": 26950993}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2008, traveled as a couple", "text": "We couldn't wait to leave. At 5:00 AM, luggage in tow, we were going to walk to the TGV station a mile away for the 6:10 train to Paris. When we got to the gate, a guard dog appeared out of the darkness, barking and snarling. It seemed docile during daylight hours but it meant business at 5 AM. The dog went nuts when I touched the gate. Thankfully my bag saved me from being bitten. His job must be to prevent people from leaving! (We paid in advance in case you are wondering.) No one answered our calls for help even after banging on the office door. We escaped by throwing food to the other side of the yard and making a run for the gate while the dog was distracted---like a scene from a Stephen King movie. The room was depressing. The toilet ran continuously and had to be shut off at the wall. Water got all over the floor because of an inadequate shower curtain. There was no maid service and we were stuck the second day with wet towels. If you like to camp out, it's not that bad a place. There was hot water, a little fridge, microwave, TV, and bed with no bugs. The free WIFI worked off and on. It is quiet at night except for the hum of a nearby power generating station and occasional train. The 2 KM walk to town along the Rhone is pleasant and the exercise did us good. Plus we got to see some homeless guys camping under a bridge. Advise: Bring food to distract the dog if you have to leave early. Quiche works fine. Better yet: Sleep under the bridge and shower at the train station for 50 cents.", "title": "Watch out for the dog", "user": "BonsoirAmis", "date": "April 25, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 1.0, "service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 1.0, "location": 2.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 15345196, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Location near Rhone", "disliked": "\u2014 Vicious guard dog"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2006, traveled with family", "text": "We were very disappointed with our stay here. To begin with this Residence Hotel is located in a semi industrial area where there is very little external support or entertainment and it is located right on the motorway. Secondly, the address instructions from the website were unclear.
