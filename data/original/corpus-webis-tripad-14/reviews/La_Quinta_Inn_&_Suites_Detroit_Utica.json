The room was clean with a fridge and microwave. There is a wide variety of restaurants and shopping nearby. Dealing with the turn arounds on I-59 and traffic was interesting. The only problem we really had was the fact we were on the 2nd floor and the people on the floor above us sounded like a herd of elephants. The running, jumping, and slamming of doors got so bad that by 2 a.m. I had enough and called the front desk.
