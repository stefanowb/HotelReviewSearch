Pizza and soft drinks on the beach costs 65 egyptian, exactly the same price as if you trundled up to the restaurant overlooking the beach. We found all the meal prices to be very good value and everything is charged to your room to be paid at the end of the holiday, which is so convenient. Our total bill, two people, lunch and dinner, with soft drinks only for one week was \u00a3340. Amazing and we eat sooo well. The all inclusive option would have cost us so much more and I think perhaps you would only benefit if you are huge drinkers. We took duty free and had a glass or two on the balcony. There are a total of twelve restaurants to choose from including the ones in Soho square and as a bed and breakfast customer you get 35% discount in five of them, including the Hot Rock, which is fantastic.", "title": "just AMAZING.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Kate3586", "date": "October 1, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 81741613}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed September 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The fact that the hotel has its own reef is such a bonus, and the snorkeling is amazing.

The beach boys are great and always find you the perfect spot no matter what time you get to the beach. There are huge umbrellas with plenty of shade if you want it.
