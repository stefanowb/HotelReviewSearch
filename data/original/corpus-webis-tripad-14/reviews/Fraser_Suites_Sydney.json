Having read the other reviews I was a little concerned before the stay regarding some of the issues but found very little to find fault with. The studio room was fine for one person and the bathroom was top end - although no bath might not suit everyone - as I like walk in showers I was very happy. The choice of TV stations was a pleasant surprise too as it was a delight to be able to watch Liverpool beat Chelsea ! I was most impressed with the Gym/pool area - so often even in 'top' hotels the gym appears to be an afterthoght in a small windowless room somewhere. Here there is a decent sized gym with 3 solid running machines - my choice - as well as other steppers /weights etc which I didn't use. There was also a nice 20m lap pool and small jacuzzi both of which were good. The only minor quibble was the lack of fresh towels in the leisure area first thing in the morning when I used the facilities. I tried the breakfast one day and it was fine though not particularly cheap 22 aud for continental buffer or 32 for including cooked option. That said it was high end and a relaxing way to start the day. The cleaning I found to be fine in the suites and the Molton Brown stuff is nice and they seemed fine about fresh supplies every day. The location is good - you can get to Town Hall station in no time - lifts availabe there if you come by train from the airport so no steps from the train to the hotel which is handy if you only have light luggage and don't fancy the taxi queues. You can also walk underground to the main shopping area via town hall station and the QVB from the corner of Kent and Bathurst Streets which is handy if it rains.", "title": "Pleasantly surprised", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "mountainmichael", "date": "October 30, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 21390941, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 location and value for money", "disliked": "\u2014 no towels in the gym"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2008, traveled on business", "text": "In summary if you fancy an up to date , contemporary good value lodging experience then I would recommend it.", "title": "Beautifully Built Fraser Suites", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "kiwinick81", "date": "October 21, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 21057574, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Spacious rooms with lovely outlook", "disliked": "\u2014 Cleanliness"}}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled with family", "text": "Unfortunately, I decided to call Fraser Suites for my wedding anniversary stay on a Sunday night.
