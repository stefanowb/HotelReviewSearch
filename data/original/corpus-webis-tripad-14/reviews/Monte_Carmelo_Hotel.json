It is very central, and yet very quiet at night. Practically no noise at all at night, which is amazing for Spain! It is because we have experienced noise levels above average in other central hotels in Spain that we chose this hotel, which is just a short walk across the river, and even though my husband is slightly incapacitated, the walk was no trouble to him. The hotel itself was also very quiet. The hotel does not seem to have walk in showers, so my husband had to climb into the bath to have a shower, which could be a problem for someone more incapacitated. However it was a low bath, so that helped. Everything worked in the room. Not a huge room but sufficient for our needs. Staff were wonderful, charming and helpful and very good English. We had a very cheap continental breakfast at 8.41 euros for 2 people which was just fine. There is a cycle hire ramp just near the hotel if you want to cycle everywhere. Great fun for the fit! There are a few great places to eat just around the corner, and great shops in all the streets near the hotel. It is very close to where they hold the April Feria. We can really recommend this lovely hotel to anyone.", "title": "Great Hotel", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Watson75", "date": "April 28, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 15441440, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff, very helpful with tips about where to go, where to eat well, and help with my Spanish.", "disliked": "\u2014 Would have liked a bigger room, and a walk in shower, but the cheap price was worth it."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2008, traveled with family", "text": "We stayed at the Monte Carmelo from the 29th of feb to the 3th of march 2008 , weather was extraordinary , blue sky and 31` during all 4 days.", "title": "Very nice hotel at a good bargain", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "guillermovilas", "date": "March 19, 2008", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0}, "id": 14380609, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff, clean , big room & bathroom , salon", "disliked": "\u2014 Could hear people talk through the walls , average breakfast ( that`s my taste)"}}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed November 2007, traveled solo", "text": "When we booked this hotel we were a bit scared because it was rated as a 3+ star hotel and it turned out to be a very good bargain.You get a lot for what you payed for ,who needs more , go for it :).", "title": "Friendly staff but small room", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "medieval", "date": "November 21, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 4.0, "business": 5.0, "service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 4.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 10967765, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Friendly staff, free internet", "disliked": "\u2014 Room was small and minimally furnished."}}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2007, traveled with friends", "text": "It`s location is good , 3 mins walk from the \"plaza de cuba\" and another 2 mins from the center of sevilla.
