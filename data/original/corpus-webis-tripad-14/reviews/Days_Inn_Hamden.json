The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the room was fairly clean and the surrounding area was nice. However, the staff was rude and I dont think he even spoke english... The room was clean, but looked like it was designed for the set of some 70s adult film, and was very small. I got a last min rate of 60.00 which was high for the type of motel this is... you can do alot better.", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "icem2829", "date": "February 4, 2005", "id": 3161381}, {"rating": 1.0, "title": "Days Inn, Hamden, CT", "text": "I've never been in a worse motel!!!!
