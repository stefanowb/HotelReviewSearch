We got a basic room and our rate went down about $10 from what we prepaid. We called and the girl who answered at the front desk phone before we arrived gave us a corner suite facing the harbor and free breakfast! Pretty good deal! Our room was beautiful and the view was very active of the busy intersection, but didn't feel very private being on the second floor. I guess that's why they invented curtains. The employees were not that helpful or friendly at all once we got there. The front desk staff was either overwhelmed or kinda rude. Our room was nice and clean and close to many good restaurants so we were very happy with our stay. This place is very pricey compared to most of Portland so make sure location is a priority because if its not then you do not need to pay the extra money.
