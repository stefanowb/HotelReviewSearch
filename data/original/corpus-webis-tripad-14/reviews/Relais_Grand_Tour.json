The B/B is wonderfully situated in the historic district, though there was never any noise, traffic or problems. We would visit the sites in the morning, eat lunch, run back to the hotel for a quick afternoon nap and be ready to go again for the evening.

The street sign for Via Reparata is about 20 or 30 feet off the ground, mounted on the side of a building, which you can't see if you're coming from the train station. Once you finally find the street, finding the hotel is also a bit of a problem, since there is no big sign saying, \"Relais Grand Tour\". Instead, the only indication of its existence is a small brass nameplate by the buzzer. So to help you make your stay here completely perfect, here's the secret: if you're coming from the train station (Novella) you'll turn left onto Via Reparata and the Relais is about halfway down the block on the lefthand side of the street.
