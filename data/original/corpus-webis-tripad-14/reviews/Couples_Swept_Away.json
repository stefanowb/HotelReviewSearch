We had called the night before to request a room not facing the road, since both my husband and I are sensitive to noise. We were guaranteed that. Upon arrival, the front desk attendant assured us our room was not facing the road said no other rooms were available anyway since the hotel was sold out. (room 2206) We got to the room and the whole window behind the bed was open to the road..We could hear every honk, splash, (it was raining) and engine over the TV. We called down to see if we could get a different room and was told \"sure\". (Wondering why the check in person lied to us saying no other room was available) We then changed rooms, with tolerable road noise. Then another story..after checking in we went to make dinner reservations. She told us they were all booked up. We told her we were only there 3 nights and would like to have at least one night to eat in a nice restaurant (especially since we pre-paid for it). She said \"no problem\" then and booked us for 7:30 at Lemongrass the same night. So, we go to dinner and they have no record of our reservation. At this point, my husband is really mad since they have been not truthful to us since arrival. We get to talk to a night duty manager who has no power and does nothing but tell us it is our fault. This was our first night experience..wasted. The next two days were better. The beach and ocean is great. You do have to get up early though to reserve a seat and hope that smokers or loud talkers don't sit near you. The food was great too. We really enjoyed the vegetarian restaurant with the sushi and sweet potatoes chips at lunch. We left on a bad note, however, when a waitress was very rude about me drinking a cup of coffee at breakfast. She didn't even want to serve it to me b/c I am pregnant. Overall, would be a great vacation if the staff was honest and truly cared about the guest experience.

What a great place. It is not as posh as some of the other places we have stayed, no marble bathrooms, no grand main desk and no spectacular fountain at the entrance. If that is what you like about resorts, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a low-key, very attentive but not pushy serivce, attention to detail place then you should go to CSA. The resort is spread out enough that even when at capacity - which it was while we were there - it doesn't seem crowded. The food was really good, not quite the variety we have had at larger resorts and the lunch buffet while good never wowed us. That said, the romantic dinner on the beach (one of the few things that has an extra charge) was one of the best meals we have ever had and Patois - the a la carte, non reservation restaurant - was great. The beach is wonderful, the sporting facilities are great and the staff are amazing. CSA is a place you go to for the energy not the buildings. The relaxed and friendly feel here are second to none. We made more friends in the week we were there than any other two weeks at other resorts. As our travel agent told us, \"Love is in the air and everyone around is breathing it\". We loved it at CSA and have already booked another trip there for the end of June.", "title": "The most relaxing vacation we have ever had", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "EdmontonMottyl", "date": "March 31, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 60023150}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed October 2009, traveled as a couple", "text": "This review is long overdue. My husband and I stayed at Couples Swept Away in October. Prior to deciding on CSA, we were going to stay at a Sandals Resort. However, after comparing the reviews, the menus, the activities, and the values, CSA won out \"hands down\". And I am so glad it did. We have traveled throughout Europe and the Middle East, the Bahamas (including several trips to Atlantis), Mexico and the Florida Beaches. This was a long overdue vacation for us and prior to our trip we would review the resort, the reviews, photos, restaurant menus, activities, etc. We had both long wanted to go to Negril. My husband even got a book on how to speak Jamaican and that only added to our excitement and anticipation! Everything went perfect with one exception. The morning of our departure to Jamaica, I came down with a terrible flu; you know the kind, sore throat, body aches, fever, head ache...need I say more? When we arrived at the airport in Montego Bay, we were escorted to Couples' reception room and served cold Red Stripe. I'm not a beer drinker (I much prefer wine or liquor) but it was great! The trip to CSA was so enjoyable; we loved the beautiful countryside and the views of the water. I would say we were already in love with Jamaica. But if the trip to CSA was the \"courting\" portion of our love affair with Jamaica, CSA was the honeymoon! When we arrived I was immediately impressed as the women were served chilled champagne and cold towels while the men completed the check in. My husband and I were escorted to our Ocean Front Suite by a fabulous young man named Webba. Webba was incredibly considerate, professional and helpful and let me know that there was a nurse on duty during the day at the resort. We had the most fabulous room I could ever imagine. It was everything and more than I expected. We were ground floor with our deck opening onto the beach with only the beach bar in between. I was so sick that, when we first got there, I could only drink Ting and the young men in the beach bar would have one ready for me when I got to the bar. The second day, I was introduced to an \"old Jamaican remedy\" for a cold or flu. Breathing the fumes from a papertowel soaked in Conquering Lion (162 proof rum) really opened up my sinuses and, by the second day, I was feeling much better. Webba called each morning to see if I was feeling better and if we needed any restocking of our room refrigerator. We had agreed to try all the restaurants but after dining at The Palms, we only tried Lemongrass once(which was incredibly awesome) but never made it to Feathers. My husband went diving each day; I was just too sick. But not too sick to make to The Palms for breakfast and lunch. The restaurant manager, Mr. Derrick Stephenson, exuded polite, sincere professionalism. I looked forward everyday to his warm welcome. The staff of The Palms were equally warming and I am still impressed by their caring and welcoming ways. And the food was soooo good. I'm usually a picky eater and my husband is very picky but that food was the best! We visited the martini bar each night after dinner. I had heard about a layered shot called the Bob Marley and when I asked about it at the martini bar, the bar tenders were excited to make it and made us feel like we were drinking something really special. We went to the Aura night club and had a blast. On our last day at the resort we decided to take the Catamaran cruise and we both went into the water and swam through the caves. Just an unbelievable experience. After we got off the boat, I bought a few souveniers; a couple of drums for my granddaughters that were made by Rasta Ralph and we (Rasta Ralph and I) put our hands over them while he said a blessing over them. When I told that to my granddaughters (age 5 and 6), their eyes got so big and, to this day, they bring their drums out when their parents have company over and tell the company the story of the Rasta Ralph, the blessing and the drums. When we got off the boat, my husband and I discovered that the sandals we left at the dive shack were gone. His were crocs and mine Ralph Lauren. My husband said, \"we will never see those again\". However, the next morning, the nice young man from the boat stopped me as I was walking to breakfast and told me he had our sandals. He had taken them inside the boat shack, brushed the sand off and cleaned them up for us. I offered him some money for that but he wouldn't take it. I actually think it offended him. So I can't say enough about CSA. We are back at work now and I'm working 70 hr work weeks. Planning our return to CSA this October is the dream that gets me through these 10 hr day/7 days a week work weeks. Thank you Couples Swept Away.

They actually understand how things are supposed to work down there! Love it! I read a couple of reviews that complained there wasn't enough food. I'll just clarify by saying that the meals are appropriately sized based on proper proportions and are fantastic. The food was wonderful and they really do have top shelf liquor. My only word of caution is in regards to housekeeping. You are given 4 towels each day and two are meant for the beach. If you like fresh towels or more than 1 each, then make sure to trade in your beach towels at the towel hut on the beach before heading back to your room.

If you are someone who would have your vacation ruined by such things you will probably want to vacation elsewhere.", "user": "Dadrock33", "date": "November 18, 2009", "id": 49529349}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wonderful!!!", "text": "We arrived on a Friday about 5pm so our first activity was the beach party.

The other restaurants had great food. The front desk staff were less than friendly and treated us as intruders as we checked in and made restaurant reservations but ALL other staff were superior in their customer service skills.
