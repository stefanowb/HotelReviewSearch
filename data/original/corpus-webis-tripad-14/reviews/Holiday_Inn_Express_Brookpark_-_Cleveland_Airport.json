There were two almost identical lamps in the room; one on bedside stand and the other on the desk. Desk lamp had electric outlets built in \u2013 bedside did not.

To me this is bad business especially since the area this hotel is located in is less than desirable and the hotel itself isn't worth the money you will spend. The rooms have a weird smell to them and the hotel lobby smells like cat urine.

I had placed a few phone calls to the hotel before Arrival, and Raj was extremely nice and very helpful. When arriving at the hotel my check in was fast and the lady was very courteous. I was disappointed when i found out they do not have the hot tub anymore that it was taken out during their reconstruction. the air conditioning unit in 209 was not strong and the windows did not open so my room was sort of hot but wasnt too uncomfortable. the pool was relaxing.
