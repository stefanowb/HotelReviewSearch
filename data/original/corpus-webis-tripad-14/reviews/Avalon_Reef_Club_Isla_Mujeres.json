We stayed in a studio facing the island and were quite comfortable. The rooms are not luxurious but are certainly attractive and spacious enough. The maid service was very good, and it was helpful to have the mini frig in the room. Our air conditioner worked well and we had good water pressure. I have always loved the location of the Avalon and still find it one of the best on the island. The beach is not what it was a couple of years ago, but that cannot be helped. There was some seaweed around the resort, but they have people working to remove what they can. All the staff were friendly and helpful.

We stopped by the sea turtle farm and for 2 dollars a piece we enjoyed some time with the endangered animals. We went to the house shaped like a conch shell, checked out the Gaffaron Park which had post card worthy views. Finally we swam with the dolphins, an experience worth every single penny. We high tailed it back to the resort and spent some time at the beach and checking out the Reef. The condos were amazing and the outside looked freshly painted. The views from the Caribbean Sea side were breathtaking. We walked to the king\u2019s bath and saw numerous fish, urchins, crabs and other sea life. The beach at the Reef is large and uncrowded.

We previously stayed there in January 2006. The beach is indeed much smaller than in '06 and as other travelers mentioned, it does smell at times. They have to clean the seaweed from the shore every day. They haul it with a wheel barrow and dump it over by the pier. There is a huge pile of dried up seaweed there. It was not like this in '06 either. We did not find out why there is so much less beach and so much seaweed and rocks. One side, by the bridge, is better than the side by the pier. You used to be able to walk in front of the restaurant, but not anymore because the beach is gone. I think it was nicer when the beach was there because now, you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the other side. They have signs up that say you should not enter that area if you are wet, have no shirt or are barefoot -- well, that is ridiculous. The only other place to get to the other side of the beach is literally through the pool. There is no place else to cross!! We also noticed some other things that I thought I would mention. Their toiletries are just cheap junk. They used to give you nice stuff with the Avalon name on it; now, it is very cheap stuff. You will get one small bottle of shampoo and two soaps and that is it. We decided to buy some shampoo, which was expensive. As other travelers have mentioned, they did turn off the electricity one day and there was no hot water on another day. It must be something they just do, I think to save money?? At 6 pm there was still no hot water and when I asked about this, he said, well, just take a cold shower then. How many of you like to do that? We stayed in a one-bedroom villa. The room was very clean. Yes, the bed was hard. The water in the shower trickled out, so if you have long hair, it takes forever to rinse. The overhead fan did not work in the room, the air conditioner was down one day, the TV remote did not work. Nevermind calling for maintenance -- you are wasting your breath. The pool area was the same. I can tell you they WERE preparing to open the swim-up bar. I have to tell you that I did not think the staff were so friendly. Courteous, at best and yes, we did tip. You have to sign for everything -- even for one drink at the bar. My husband did get sick from something, not sure what. The fancy restaurant was only OK. What ticked us off was that we were boldly told that men MUST where long pants, cannot wear sandals or a T-shirt. Well, guess what -- we look over next to us and there was a guy sitting with cut off shorts and flip flops, yet they would not let this other guy in who was wearing shorts. Rules for some, not others??? I'm sorry, buy my husband was roasting in there. The air conditioning was not on very high. We requested to sit under a fan so he could stand it. The grounds are kept up very nicely though. They are beautiful. The hammocks were great and as before, the King's Pool was a lot of fun. If you like to watch TV and I know a lot of people do, there were not many stations in English. If you like soccer, there was probably 3 channels with that on. They had CNN from, I think, England. We did choose the all-inclusive plan. Some of the food was very good, some was not so good . . . . I did not think much of the breakfast buffet. The self-help portion had some stuff that looked awful. They used to have scrambled eggs, french toast in there. Now, you have to special order the eggs and there is no french toast or waffles. They will make you pancakes though. No oatmeal either. I like oatmeal and when I asked for some, they gave me a bowl of dried oats!! They still have nice fruit although not always bananas. We did have to pay for the transportation too. This was included the first time we visited -- not anymore. There was only a couple of nights where there was some entertainment. Don't expect that. No bingo by the pool!! One afternoon they had trivia at the beach. There was one day of volleyball in the pool. Yoga at 11 am. in the pool. All in all, please know that it is STILL a very pretty location, in fact, there was a wedding there on Wednesday. I am just trying to give people a \"heads up\" about some things. We went into town a couple of times. There is a lot of construction going on, as one other traveler pointed out. Someone told us that the Avalon was being sold to the Mayan Palace organization and that they were going to rip down the Avalon and build something else at that location. I have no idea if this is true! I wish I did. This person said the owner of the Avalon Resorts needs the money.
