The only negative thing I can come up with: the pool is freezing. No way is it heated. However the hot tub was quite nice. Room service menu is surprisingly limited... I hope they expand it once they are done with the renovations. Food was pretty good though. Does anyone else wish hotels would offer lower/mid price food for snacks. I sure would order more often if they did. Starbucks fit the bill pretty good for our snacking impluses. But again, the service was really good.
