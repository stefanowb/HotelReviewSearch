What a wonderful, pleasant surprise! I expected creepy and noisy and what we got was clean, helpful and a delightful experience! The front desk help was exactly that, HELPFUL!

The breakfast was very nice and the lady who ran the kitchen was very efficient and ran the cleanest kitchen I've seen in a long time! The coffee was great, they even had local alpenk\u00e4se. I would go back there in a heartbeat! The views are fantastic -- you can't believe it.
