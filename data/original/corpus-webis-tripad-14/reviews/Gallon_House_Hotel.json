Our room was the Castle View on the top floor and gave superb views towards the castle one way and over the viaduct in the other direction.

We stayed at Gallon House in May of this year for our daughters first birthday (she won't remember it, but we certainly will!!) We stayed in the castle view room, which as many reviewers have pointed out has some great views, it is well furnished and homely as is every area of the house from the conservatory (with more great views) to the huge settees which you just sink into in the living room area. We chose to ate at the hotel for all 3 nights of our stay both because of the convenience with having a baby with us and the reviews of Ricks food. Just as all the other reviews tell you, we were not disappointed! We were a little wary of having to sit at a dining table with people who we didn't know as we had our daughter with us, but on the 2 nights where we were dining with other guests it was no problem at all and we had an evening of great food and conversation. The food on each night was varied, so so tasty and well presented, Rick was able to accomodate my daughters dietry requirements also (he also made her a little piped potato birthday cake with candle on her big day too!) I also came away with Rick's recipe for his mushroom tartlet which was so nice I had to know how to make it! The location is very good - within easy reach of both York and Harrogate, and there is a very good pub across the road from the train station!! Parking is a bit of a pain, but nothing which could detract from such a relaxing treat of a stay. We'll definately be back to Gallon House in the future and can recommend to all, that if you are looking for somewhere to stay in Knaresborough or the surrounding area, that Gallon House is a must (& make sure you book yourselves in for dinner too!)", "title": "A warm, welcoming stay, beautiful building & excellent food!", "user": "adethomp", "date": "October 3, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 141905873}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled as a couple", "text": "We had found Gallon house, as many others, via the internet. We were not disappointed and enjoyed the pace and atmosphere of the hotel enormously. The food was fabulous and certainly made the weekend a gastronomic delight. As it was our silver wedding anniversary we had chosen to eat elsewhere, apart from the evening we arrived, as we wanted to have a more intimate dining experience than Gallon was able to offer, this is not a criticism. We would recommmend that you make time during your stay to just sit and enjoy the view from Gallon over the Nidd it really is stunning and I for one could have easily spent an entire day watching the trains, boats and wildlife in the gardens and on the river below. A disappointment was not catching a flash of blue of the resident kingfisher but the variety of many other birds made up for this. There is lots to enjoy in Knaresborough and when the sun came out it was quite magical. There is an interesting set of trompe d'oeil paintings around the town and it is quite good fun trying to track them all down. Further afield there is breathtaking scenery in abundance and a trip to Harrogate on the train with tea at Betty's is a great way to spend a day. Rick and Sue make a trip to Yorkshire every bit worth the journey and as i said in their personal guest book the hotel should be availble on the NHS.

I had found this hotel last year on browsing the internet with good reviews for staying and eating there. I booked it early so as to not be disappointed and so i had a chance to save up lol. It's not cheap and with the meal and 2 bottles of wine the bill was well over \u00a3200 for 1 night but i wanted somewhere special..somewhere we wouldn't forget in a hurry. Firstly...the hotel is lovely, warm, inviting and very bright and airy, knaresborough is a beautiful historic town and the Gallon House was my only choice. Rick allowed us to check in early as we were going walking all afternoon which was nice. We were offered coffee in the conservatory on arrival...nice touch. We were given instructons on were to park for free and having a room over the back we could also see our car from our room. Our room was if i'm honest a little disappointing. I had seen the photos and was indeed looking forward to the spectacular views at the back of the house. We were shown around and were taken on to the balcony downstairs first and i thought wow...top marks but i couldnt mark this hotel ecellent like i wanted to. Our room was at the top of the house and was smaller than i had hoped for and the bathroom was a tad cramped. If you drop the soap in the shower you cannot retreive it. The room i wanted was the one with the balcony and as i had booked early i thought i would have had 1st choice as i was led to beleive no one else was booked in yet that weekend. However not to put a dampener on this review i hadn't asked for the balcony room...i just assumed both rooms at the back both had balconys...i shouldn't assume. Unfortunaltely ours didn't but i thought hey never mind we wont be in much to appreciate it and anyway it's winter so it goes dark early. I would however love to stay again but only in the balcony room over summer. The only thing i would say is for the price we paid you shouldn't have a blown window!!!
