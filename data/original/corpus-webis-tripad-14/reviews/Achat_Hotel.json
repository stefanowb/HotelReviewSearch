The location was very easy to access by the bus or subway system. The room was clean and nice sized. The breakfast was filling and service was excellent. All of our travels around Munich was by the Subway and it was a pleasant experience. The Oktoberfest was an experience we will not soon forget as well as the many friends we made while there.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "A TripAdvisor user", "date": "November 4, 2004", "id": 2805233}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Love the Location", "text": "Nice place to stay.
