Upon our arrival at the hotel, the charming receptionist (who spoke excellent English) gave us some information about the hotel, and advised us our room would be ready in three minutes - it was ready in even less than that! We paid \u20ac320 for two nights in a classic room, so were delighted to be given a complimentary upgrade to a club room as we were on our honeymoon - totally unexpected, and very much appreciated! We had room 405, which was on the 4th floor, and overlooked the road and metro line. We had no noise at all from the Metro, and the road was only a little noisy during the day. Who spends all their time in their room in Paris during the day anyway?! The room was spacious compared to what we had been expecting, and had modern Art Deco style decor. The bathroom was also very modern and had an amazingly powerful shower.", "user": "cashmere12", "date": "May 20, 2010", "id": 64846741}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "Clean and Friendly hotel very close to Eiffel Tower", "text": "The only negative comment I could make about our room was that the handle for the shower was a bit loose, as was the door handle to the bathroom, and there was a small stain on the carpet next to the bed.

We asked the receptionist where we could go for nice evening meals, and she directed us to the Latin Quarter / Notre Dame area (about 10 minutes away on the RER). In that area, you can find some really good value restaurants (as well as the expensive ones) that provide good quality French cuisine. On our first night, we had a two course meal each, a pichet of wine and a bottle of water for about \u20ac40 which we thought was very reasonable. A three-course meal in the Latin Quarter again with the same drinks was about \u20ac45. Definitely have some French onion soup if you can! For breakfast, we were looking for pastries and hot drinks. If you turn left out of the hotel and walk for 7-8 minutes along Boulevard de Grenelle, you will come across Stephane Secco's bakery / patisserie which is on the left hand side of the road. We had two pastries each and a hot drink each which set us back about \u20ac9.50 - and they were delicious too. There is a supermarket right near to the hotel, which is great for buying bottled water and other essentials, and there are several cash machines between the hotel and the bakery, too.", "user": "FromFLtoItaly", "date": "May 16, 2010", "id": 64342016}, {"rating": 5.0, "title": "immaculate & great location: tower around corner!", "text": "We had booked a couple of excursions before we went to Paris. We paid approx \u00a3190 for a Paris Illuminations tour by coach, followed the late performance of Moulin Rouge with champagne. The coach tour (run by Paris Vision, and we booked through Expedia) was very informative and lasted about 90 minutes, taking you past all the major sights and many more. Moulin Rouge was OK - though we had no room to move in our seats, we queued for ages to get in, and there were boobs out the entire time. I'd say if you're desperate to see it, then do, but if you're toying between that and something else at the same price - go for the other option! We also went on a lunch cruise with Bateaux Parisiens which starts from near the Eiffel Tower and lasts for about 2 hours. We had the middle class of service, so were sat next to a window. We had booked directly with Bateaux Parisiens, and were thrilled to be given our own table - we were expecting to be on a table of 4 - and subsequently a bottle of wine to share. Our three course meal was absolutely brilliant - the iced nougat was to die for - and we really enjoyed the musical entertainment whilst on board.

Our rooms were definitely small but nice. Navigating around another person in the room was tough. Our rooms were on the street side so our 1st floor room did have street noise from the outside throngs of people and the train. A decent breakfast was included in the rate. Hotel employees, especially concierge Jean Francois were very helpful. One problem was hallway lights. The lights outside our room were frequently out and we had to fumble our way in the dark and feel the doorway to find he place for the key door transponder. WIFI on our floor did not work at times. Good AC & comfortable beds. YES, AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NOTED, PICKPOCKETS ARE VERY ACTIVE. We were hit by a gang of young girls in the RER station. Do not run for a train. They will throng you and try to get to your money.

I arrived at the hotel to find my purse had been pickpocketed on the Metro. The staff could not have been more helpful and spoke excellent English. They helped in every way their could. They were simply the best and they all deserve a pay rise! Our room was very quite, being at the back of the hotel, overlooking other buildings but this did not concern me. The windows opened fully which was pleasant on our hotter days. I travelled with my son (13) and daughter (19). The double bed was big enough for myself and my 13 year old son to share without kicking each other and my daughter was comfortable on the fold out bed. Good quality duvets and pillows which make us sleep very well. The bathroom was very clean and modern and the shower nice and powerful. Nice toiletries were provided. A little more storage space needed for 3 of us but we were comfortable and enjoyed our stay. We ate breakfast in the cafes next door and if the hotel breakfast had been cheaper we would have had it there. The Metro opposite was so convenient. Great views of the Eiffel Tower which was just around the corner and very convenient for the Open Top Bus Ride which I highly recommend. We also went on a river cruise. The Louvre was our highlight and I insisted we had the audio guide. Only a few pounds each. This really enhanced our tour of the Louvre and so many people were missing out by not having this. The kids gained so much from the information on it. My children want to return to Paris and I would not hesitate to book this hotel again.

Overall, it was a positive experience. On the positive side, it has a great location and the metro is right across the street. The hotel is decorated nicely. On the negative side, the rooms are small and look as though they could use some fresh paint. Our bathroom looked a little worn and tired as well. The hotel advertised free wifi and it didn't work for the entire duration of our stay. That was a real frustration since I had reported it immediately and was told it would be taken care of. We had to wait to use the 1 computer available to guests of the hotel. The immediate area around the hotel offers little as far as restaurants that are any good.

The hotel location was perfect for a short stay as all the main tourist attractions are practically on your doorstep. I would recommend to anyone who is visiting Paris for the first time and wants to visit all the main attractions to buy a 2 day pass for the Le Tour (lime green open-top bus). This leaves from just outside the Eiffel Tower (5 min walk from hotel) and stops at all the main places. Its not fast like the underground but you get to see Paris whilst travelling, and you're on holiday, so no need to rush! Our hotel room was very small (room 306), and view non existent unless you enjoy looking into other peoples rooms! If you like space and a nice view I would recommend forking out a bit more (we were 'classic' room). Aside from the size, the room was very clean, and all we really needed.
