You usually have sandpaper rough towels and never that fresh clean smell.

It was beautifully presented fresh,hot,tasty,huge choice and never ever ran short.The service was 5 star, never ever did our party sit with an empty glass, there was always a happy smiling waiter/waitress on hand to top up the glasses. The staff worked so hard to ensure everyone was looked after, and what shone through was the staffs team work. Never ever did the staff appear mardy and the resturant Manager had us in tucks of laughter at every meal and should be wearing a jesters outfit for his effort. I would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel to anyone. It well deserves the 5 stars it has earned.

Yes, it is in a very good location probably the best in Olu Deniz. I read some rave reviews about this hotel on TA before going and I was really expecting something fabulous. The hotel is quite dated and basic. We had a room in the main hotel and the wardrobe was a joke as there was a shelf half way down which prevented anything other that the tiniest top hanging properly so don't take your long dresses ! The room was clean but we didn't get any 'maid's creations' or flowers on our bed like so many had mentioned. The toiletries consisted of shower gel, shampoo and 4 cotton buds oh and a pencil and sewing kit ! 5 Star I think not. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room and the air conditioning was good. The TV only had the usual basic channels. On the plus side there are fabulous views from the dining room which is all open air (beware of flies at the buffet during the day) The white wine is quite pleasant and the beer is refreshing in the heat, we had it with lemonade. The Plaza Bar at night is very atmospheric with great music, don't bother with the entertainment unless it is imported. The staff do work very hard which we appreciated. It is very clicky with the entertainment team spending time with their 'favourites' which was fine by us as they left us mostly alone! I must mention Air who was in his own words 'everywhere' ! I don't think any of the staff get a day off so 10 out of 10 to them.
