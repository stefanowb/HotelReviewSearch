There were horrible rust stains on all the LAMPSHADES! How the lampshades got wet in the first place, I honestly do NOT want to know. The carpet was frayed, and in some places, bare to the concrete. The bathroom was covered in mildew, including the ceiling. Many walls had had holes punched in them, and there was a patching over them, but the holes were never completely repaired. The sink-stopper was broken, and in the down position. My husband got it to come out, and it was covered with hair and mildew-brown gunk. The blanket smelled horrible, and was filled with holes. We pushed it out of our way, and just used the sheet, which, being white, we hoped at least had been in some bleach recently. There were dust balls and gobs of hair stuck to where they stack up your \"clean\" towels/washcloths, so that when you pulled one out to use, it had dust and hair stuck to it. There were smears of something (again, I don't really want to know WHAT) on the bedside table.

The rooms all smelled terrible, carpet frayed, filthy bathrooms, one room missing a telephone, several deadbolts didn't work on the doors, a window fell off when an adult opened it, no screens on the windows. It was absolutely disgusting. After several parents inspected their kids room (they were at a different hotel), they wanted to take their kids with them! I will write Days Inn corporate and red flag this hotel. To add insult to injury, the front desk and manager didn't address any of our concerns and wouldn't reduce the rate.
