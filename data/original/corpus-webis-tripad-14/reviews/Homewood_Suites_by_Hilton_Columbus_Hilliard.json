We could have made the 2 hour trip back home, but wanted a weekend away that included allowing the kids to swim in the indoor pool. We had done this last year, and stayed at the Hampton Inn Polaris, but their queen suites were already booked. The Homewood Suites Hilliard was clean, the staff was friendly, the free breakfast was adequate, and our 2 bedroom king suite was a good value ($134). The only issue was the beds - they were so uncomfortable! - they were too soft, to the point where I felt like I was going to fall off the bed if I was near the edge. We have stayed at many Hampton Inns (a Hilton property like Homewood), and always find the beds to be extremely comfortable.

Once in our room, we noticed there was no door knob on the bathroom door, just a big hole where someone sawed it out. Travelling with 2 young children, so the idea of a suite was perfect, however when we opened up the pull-out couch there were sheets already on it. It was pretty obvious they WERE NOT CLEAN, when we saw clothes all bunched up in the sheets. We tried calling the front desk to complain, and nobody answered (about 9:30pm). So we went down there, where we were handed new sheets, and told to put the old ones in the hallway. Yuck.

There are no vending machines, only a 'suite shop' (seriously) that stocks food and snacks to the left of the check in counter, and even then, you have to wait for someone to be available, in order to pay for your items.
