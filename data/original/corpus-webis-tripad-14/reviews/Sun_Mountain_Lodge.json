The lodge is quite remote, but the roads were well maintained and easy to drive. We found the two-bedroom Mt. Robinson Suite we needed to accommodate our party to be spacious, clean, well-appointed and -maintained, and quite comfortable (except for the sleeper sofa, which my son found uncomfortable; suggestion: use a memory foam mattress, which at The Maxwell Hotel in Seattle he declared to be the most comfortable sleeper sofa we had ever consigned him to). The views from the room and other sites about the lodge were terrific. The amenities in the lodge were very nice, and there's no shortage of nature-related activities. Did not have a chance to use the spa or the stable, but pricing seemed reasonable. No TVs in the rooms (though one of the commons rooms in the lodge had one), but WiFi service was quite good. Unsurprisingly, cellphone connectivity was borderline. At breakfast the first morning, the food (at prices you'd expect for an upscale hotel in a remote location) was decent but otherwise unmemorable, and service was pleasant but slow (not that we were in a rush); all in all, we were not impressed enough to eat dinner there (despite the four-diamond AAA rating) and instead had decent dinners one night at the Twisp River Pub in Twisp about 15 miles away and the next night at The Breadline Caf\u00e9 in Omak, about an hour away. (The drives were beautiful, but of course there's no drive in the Cascades that's not beautiful.) The lodge very kindly accommodated our need for an early departure the following morning and had packed continental breakfasts waiting for us at the front desk. We found all of the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. At the substantially discounted price I was able to negotiate for the suite and breakfast (after finding erroneously low prices on their website), we felt the value to be reasonable, but I doubt we would have stayed there at the (correct) posted price. The night clerk told me the lodge has been owned by a German family for about 20-25 years. It was evident to me that their attention to excellence at this property is such that I would certainly consider staying at their properties in Germany and the Caribbean.", "title": "Outstanding mountain resort", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "afrinl", "date": "June 22, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 164851506}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Sun mountain lodge very nice the scenery was beautiful .
