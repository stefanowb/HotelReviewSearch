Really interesting modern decor and a lovely airy lobby with beautiful arches and a sun roof were especially nice touches. The free internet was a huge bonus, and the staff were helpful. The room, although a bit small, was clean and completely adequate. Shower was a bit hard to get to (sort of in a corner of the bathroom too close to the sink). Overall, we were very pleased.", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "boonyc", "date": "August 7, 2006", "id": 5575728}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed July 2006, traveled with family", "text": "I had high expectations for this hotel, it looked great on the website and was pleased that I could book a family room as so many hotels do not seem to offer 4 bedded rooms. However I feel that the hotel is far from high tech; the renovation is very Ikea-ish and has been fitted out cheaply with a disgusting tatty blanket masquerading as a throw on the bed. As others have said the sound proofing is non existent and although we had a room at the back overlooking a drab rooftop we had very little sleep. The conversations of those in the room above and next door were clearly audible and I am not really that keen on listening to other people 'at it'!", "title": "High expectations..poor performance", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "RomanNose", "date": "July 30, 2006", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 3.0, "business": 3.0, "service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 2.0, "location": 5.0, "rooms": 1.0}, "id": 5528704, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 The noise"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "The bunk beds were hazardous as the top bunk did not have a gaurd rail so I had to fit a 5 and 7 year old into the bottom bunk each night and fold back the top bunk.", "title": "Great City \u2013 Great Hotel.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Geoff A", "date": "July 7, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 4.0}, "id": 5435325}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed June 2006", "text": "Breakfast is a complete rip off, we had it included in our rate so took advantage of it but don't expect anything appetising.

On recommendation from another tripadvisor review we requested room 204 (we booked direct on the hotel's website). The room overlooks the internal courtyard so there is no noise from traffic. We didn't hear any of the other residents either. The bathroom is great (glass sink and double jet shower), the room was clean and comfortable. The minimalist design means that it feels a bit souless compared to the glamour of Seville, but it is a reliable choice - from what I have read about other hotels the rooms can be variable within a hotel so it was good to know that you were getting. If you turn left out of the hotel and left at the end of the road there is a great cafe for breakfast and lunches opposite the cathedral (Il Horno Buensomething).", "title": "clean, central, friendly", "helpfulness": 4, "user": "Laura_in_Spain", "date": "April 12, 2006", "detail_rating": {"cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "rooms": 4.0, "service": 3.0}, "id": 4966289}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2006", "text": "I would definitely stay there again, but if I was going in the height of summer I would choose a hotel with a rooftop pool.
