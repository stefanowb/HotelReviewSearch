This time, I was torn between staying at the Hard Rock again or booking the Hotel Felix. The offer of free Wifi and a relatively inexpensive King size bed was irresistible. Unfortunately, we got neither. We booked through Hotels.com. As usual, when booking through an internet discount site, I felt like we were given one of the worst rooms in the hotel. Our room was directly across from the elevator. Let me mention a few of the positives about the hotel. The rooms are generally quiet (more on the exception to this later) and as mentioned by several other reviewers - impeccably clean. They offer nice H2O bath products, but are very stingy with them. We stayed four nights and were only given one bar of soap for the stay. Although we always tip our cleaning person, it wasn't enough to get her to leave us shampoo each day. The hotel is conveniently located near many great restaurants. For breakfast we loved Tempo Cafe and Original Pancake house. The doormen were friendly and helpful. Front desk staff not so friendly. We booked a king sized bed, and the person who checked us in ensured that we were getting one, but it was in fact queen-sized. (Maybe he thought we wouldn't notice in the small room). The bed was comfortable. The air quality in the room seemed to be better than in most hotels. Strangely, the room had an ice bucket, but no drinking glasses. Also, there was no coffee maker. One night people in the room next to us came in drunk at 4 am. The woman was sobbing and the man was shouting profanities. I find it hard to believe that their behaviour in the lobby wouldn't have caused some concern with the hotel staff, because they were fighting when they got off the elevator. It would have been nice if someone had intervened before the couple woke up everyone on my floor. We phoned the front desk, and they came up quickly and asked the people to be quiet. The noise continued a bit longer afterward. The hotel did not seem to have any security, and it appeared that people could come and go pretty easily. This brings me to the wifi. If like me you like to stream video on the internet - DON'T stay here. The Hotel Felix has the worst internet service I've had the displeasure to use in a long time. You cannot even watch a video on YouTube. I would much rather PAY for reliable internet than use such an archaic free service.", "title": "Worst Wifi in Chicago (that's why it's free)", "user": "tarheeldeb", "date": "May 2, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 2.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 2.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 63052351}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "i booked hotel felix on expedia at about $80/night. small room with a queen bed, no storage space. it fit my needs, but people seem to have had problems with two bed requests. the hotel is modern, and the beds were very comfortable. fit and finish were good. i was a little worried about the housekeeping service as i found a number of hairs on the supposedly clean bed. all in all, a fair stay, decent for the price. probably about a 5 or 6 block walk to the red line, not a lot of buses run in the area. if you can find a good rate, you can probably find a more central hotel.", "title": "small but comfortable", "user": "dethman", "date": "April 30, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 2.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 62814225}, {"rating": 2.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2010, traveled as a couple", "text": "The room is so small that my knees and shoulder are bruised from walking into the bed and hitting the tv.

My shoulder kept hitting the wall and my knee would hit the bed as the walkway was only 2 feet 3\" wide. The 6\" that the Tv stuck out made the walkway around 18\". On the side of the bed near the window there was a very small area of 4 feet to put your bag. There were two pull out drawers under the bed to store clothing. This room is smaller than the rooms I have rented in Europe. The maid brought fresh towels each day but she did not vacuum or wash the floors. We asked for extra blankets for our child so she could sleep on the floor but they did not bring them. We actually asked for the blankets to be in the room prior to our arrival and again when we arrived.

I didn't like that in order to get a cup of coffee in the morning you had to actually go into the nice restaurant. I need the cup of coffee to get ready in the a.m. I don't want to have to dress and be presentable just to get my jaffa. We also ordered room service one day which was good.
