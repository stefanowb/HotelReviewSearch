{"user_rating": 4.0, "review_count": 16, "name": "Hotel Juras Brize", "reviews": [{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Great Hotel in great little City", "text": "We stayed at the Juras Brize for one night during our tour of Latvia. Contact was very efficient per e-mail. The hotel is located in a very quiet residential area, across the street is hospital. The city center can be reached on foot in about 20 minutes. The staff at the Hotel was quite friendly, something you don't often encounter in Latvia. We booked the Family Room and a Studio Suite. The Suite is one HUGE room with 2 single beds and a pull-out couch and the Family Room is actually a small apartment with separate livingroom and bedroom. A nice touch are the tea and coffee making facilities in both rooms. Both rooms come equipped with Shower and Toilet (no Bathtubs) and Sat-TV (with about 500 foreign channels - even from Afghanistan and Iraq!!). Breakfast is not included in the rates, but they have a nice selection to choose from in the Restaurant / Bistro attached to the Hotel and its really cheap (I paid 1 LVL 90 for a Farmers Breakfast). There is a small guarded parking lot in the back.", "helpfulness": 6, "user": "Jetstream1958", "date": "August 2, 2007", "id": 8280205}], "location": {"country": "Latvia", "region": "Kurzeme Region", "continent": "Europe", "city": "Ventspils"}, "variance": {"poor": 0, "average": 4, "very good": 10, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 2}, "slim_ranking": 0.285714285714}
