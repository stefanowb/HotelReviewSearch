When I arrived the very young hotel staff welcomed me with open arms and check-in was a breeze. I requested a king view room on an upper floor and that's exactly what I received. The room was very spacious and offered a superb view. It's location is in the middle of all the action and within walking distance of a huge array of restaurants, shops and the Broadway theaters. With this hotel only being open now for just over a week the diner style restaurant in the lobby along with the rooftop lounge have not been completed and the guest rooms are only available up to floor 29 but don't let that keep you from thinking about staying here.", "title": "Hyatt Times Square", "helpfulness": 7, "user": "evvtraveler", "date": "December 9, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187197251}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "The lobby is modern, minimalist, bright white walk to the elevators. Many happy staff everywhere on their third day open. We were the first to stay in our king room, 1811. The sleeping area was 13 by 15, with floor to ceiling window, full length mirror, safe, coffee, mini-fridge. Extra for internet in room. A hall to the modern bathroom, shower only. The location was perfect for theater. The hotel rooftop restaurant is not yet open. Hotel has Irish pubs on either side, but it was very quiet in the room on Saturday night. Manhattan hotel prices were very high on this tree-lighting weekend, but the Hyatt was a relative bargain.", "title": "Bright New Hotel", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Sunbu", "date": "December 8, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 187064609}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "New Hotel", "text": "Anytime you can stay in any new hotel in the Big Apple is a treat. This hotel is centrally located, half a block to Broadway and 2.5 blocks from Time Square. The staff is young, eager and helpful. The room still has the new room smell, small but no smaller than NYC standard. Room is functional and the bathroom is shower only so you don't have to deal with disgusting hotel shower curtains. Good for business and leisure. Good value too.", "helpfulness": 5, "user": "Frank d", "date": "December 6, 2013", "id": 186951979}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "Brand new hotel in a great location. The management and staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Hyatt obviously hand-picked some of its best management to staff this new hotel for its opening. There were a few minor glitches on day one, but the staff put forth a good effort to resolve them. There is still construction going on to complete the upper floors and the main restaurant and rooftop lounge are not yet open. The hotel itself is modern and perfectly comfortable.", "title": "overall a nice hotel", "helpfulness": 8, "user": "sussrum", "date": "December 5, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 186868215}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "New York City"}, "stars": 4, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 2, "very good": 13, "terrible": 0, "excellent": 22}, "slim_ranking": 0.293453724605}
