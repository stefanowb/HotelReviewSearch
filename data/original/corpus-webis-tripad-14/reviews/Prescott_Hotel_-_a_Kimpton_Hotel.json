I would agree with that rating only for the location of this hotel- Union Square could not be closer. But the room we were given could have used some refurbishing- wallpaper peeling away, carpet seems old and musty, paint could have been done by a 10 year old. The awkward angles in the bathroom left me with bruises on my elbows while trying to dry my hair. We were on the third floor, and the street noises were relatively loud (as well as a rocking party in the private club across the street on Saturday night) but as I always travel with ear plugs this was not an issue- if you are a light sleeper this would be irritating. Our last night we ordered some late room service, and the one thing that I specified- I could have no sesame seeds on my hamburger bun, (which the lady checked with the kitchen when she took my order and assured me there were none on the buns tonite) and when my meal arrived- I was scraping sesame seeds off- too tired and hungry to send it back! The service from the front desk and especially Lane as Concierge brought the hotel back up to standards for us. The inclusion of the breakfast buffet ensured that we kick started our days with fresh fruit, bagels and coffee. Free WiFi when you join Klimpton on line. We love San Francisco, but I would explore other hotel options for our next visit. It is not worthy of four stars. Note: See Wicked if you have the chance!

And, Patricia at the front desk added those small, almost unnoticeable touches, that really helped. We wrote the manager afterward to commend everyone. One night we were too tired to dine out and the staff recommended a little Thai restaurant for take-out nearby - we ate in the lobby by the fire with a bottle of wine we picked up in Sonoma.

The location is great - a block to all the great shopping that Union Square offers. Great sushi restaurants, cafes, bars and restaurants can be found in the blocks surrounding the hotel. We took a tour of Sonoma and Muir Woods with Extranomical Tours on Friday. You will only spend an hour in Muir Woods but according to my sister - If you have seen one redwood you have seen them all. The tour stops at three wineries and a cafe for lunch. In order to pack in all the wineries you only stay for about 45 minutes at each winery. You have enough time for tastings, photos and a quick walk around the grounds. The wineries do not provide a tour of the grounds nor do you see anything about how the wine is made. It' great if you are only there for a few days like we were and are trying to fit everything in. We hit all the tourist spots - the Cannery, Ghiradelli Square, the Wharf, a streetcar, a cablecar, the Haight and Alamo Square.
