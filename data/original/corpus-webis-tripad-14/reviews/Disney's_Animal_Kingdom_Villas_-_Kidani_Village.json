I loved our room (1 bedroom villa), large bedroom, bathroom, living area, as well as an additional bathroom in the living area (Jambo House 1 bedrooms do not have this feature). We are a family of four and the kids slept on the pull out couch which was quite comfortable for a pull out couch. Bedding in the master bedroom was also very comfortable. Bus service at this resort was great, we never waited very long for a bus. We did not use room service so I cannot speak to that. We loved Sanaa and had wonderful service there as well as our meals. The pool at Kidani is great for kids, with one big slide and then a zero-entry part to it which is where my 3 year old and I hung out. There is also the splash and play area but we did not really utilize that. The fitness center is near the pool, which is kind of a pain, I would rather see it inside the actual resort. The one downside is that there is no quick service option at Kidani. We luckily had kitchen and rental car so this was not a big issue for us but if you were staying in a studio with no kitchen and had to walk to Jambo for everything, it would be a little bit of a hike. I should add as well we checked in immediately upon arrival which was early, around noon, our room just happened to be ready. I'm sure this isn't always the case but it definitely added to the \"magic\" of our first day. We will be staying here again in July.

I still love it but there were a few things on this trip that were a little distressing. There is only one pool in Kidani and it was pretty busy for January. They do not have a quiet pool like some of the other DVC resorts. Also my savannah view room had very limited viewing of the animals. We saw one giraffe, some wildebeasts and 1 ostrich. Most of the other animals were in other areas or too far away for viewing from our balcony. I love the theme of this resort. It has a nice feel and you really do think you are in Africa. However be aware that the resort is rather dark and so is the room. It is hard to get adjusted to that and it is difficult to figure out how to control all of the lighting in the room. I would return here because it is just so calming and more peaceful then some of the other disney resorts. The parking garage is underground and that has its pros and cons. I have not eaten in the restaurants in kidani or jambo house but everyone says they are all excellent.

We lucked out with pricing by purchasing DVC points through a 3rd party vendor which allowed for us to book the rooms here for the price Disney would typically charge for a moderate resort. Otherwise there'd be no way we'd be able to stay here. Since it was a DVC room, we didn't really get to experience the house keeping during our stay but we can say that the rooms were wonderful and clean when we came in plus there was an efficiency kitchen that is helpful should you wish to cook something and cut down on food costs at Disney. The bed was smaller than we expected but they were very comfortable. Because of the location, you can wait a long time before a bus servicing this hotel gets to you. One quirk of this location is that the rooms are spaced VERY far apart so if you're not near the lobby, you will be walking a long time to get to your room. (This can be an issue if you're tired from walking around the parks all day and you find out upon getting to your room you have to return to the lobby to get something from the store)", "title": "Great service, great view, LONG WALK to room.", "user": "d20010", "date": "January 27, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 150750030}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed December 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Hello everyone!

The few \"new\" differences from previous stays - check in was supposed to be faster and more convenient if you do online check-in and simply pick-up your room keys at a designated desk. However, we were met at the front door by a cast member who \"helped\" us with check-in instead. This seemed to be slightly longer and a bit more of a production than the standard check-in used to be. Everything else throughout the stay in relation to the resort was outstanding.
