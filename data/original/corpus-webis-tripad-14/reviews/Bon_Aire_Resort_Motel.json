The weather was GREAT! 90 or higher everyday. We had 3 days with about an hour of rain/storms--but it was always around lunch time so it worked out ok. Went to Fort Desoto Beach one day--stingrays--but still beautiful! Saw a couple of small sharks @ Bon-Aire Beach. Also a dead sea turtle that had washed up--pretty disgusting! I only have 3 complaints about Bon-Aire--1 * The ladies that work in the office need to improve their attitudes, they can be hateful. 2 * Parking--supposed to be for guests only--one night I saw about 8 cars without guest tag--no wonder you are only allowed 1 car per room! and 3 * Don't even bother trying to use the hotel's computer--every time you ask to use it the ladies in the office tell you that someone is using it(even if they aren't) I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO GET UP AND UNLOCK THE DOOR.
