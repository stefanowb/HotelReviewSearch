It's in a great location between the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain, tucked away on a quiet street. Our stay there was less than great. Our first room was terrible (room # 404) - the bed was very uncomfortable, it sagged in the middle; the room was extremely small; and the shower was awful. The half glass door in the shower did not keep in the water and each time we took a shower, the entire bathroom got wet. There were puddles all over the floor. The front desk staff at the hotel is hit or miss (like I read on another review). We told the front desk about the issue and the man called maintenance and brushed us off. That same front desk clerk gave us very bad directions to the Borghese Gallery. The next day we complained about our room to a different front desk clerk, who was very nice and helpful. They moved us to room 307, which was much better - the bed was very comfortable, the room was spacious and we didn't have any trouble with the shower. If we would have had room 307 the entire stay, our review would be much different and more positive overall. The decor in the hallways is very dated and in desperate need of updating. The breakfast was okay. We would possibly stay at this hotel again based on location, but I'd want to ensure we'd receive a room like 307.", "title": "Great location, average hotel", "helpfulness": 3, "user": "Alicia D", "date": "January 31, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 3.0, "cleanliness": 3.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 3.0, "rooms": 3.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 123939863}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2011, traveled with family", "text": "My family and I had such an excellent stay at this hotel.

Tucked away on a very quiet street but near everything (shopping,Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Spanish Steps, good restaurants) we thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay there. The staff was very attentive and helpful, too. This is a smaller hotel (about 50 rooms) so you get more attention to detail. The room was not huge but quite adequate and the bathroom was very clean and a nice size. Lots of closet space, too. The morning breakfast was very nice and served in a quaint, quiet dining room, just off the main lobby. You could tell that the other people staying at this hotel also enjoyed the quiet atmosphere. WiFi was available in the very large and comfortable sitting area of the main lobby. We could walk to almost any of our destinations, which was an added bonus.

My room, 101, had the dirtiest, nastiest carpet i have ever encountered in my life, let alone in a hotel room. An utter horror! The wallpaper is an expensive fabric type which too is old and dirty and should have been replaced several years ago. Room was very small but quiet (apart from about 30 phone calls one night from kids in another room-we tried to call reception, etc. but no one answered so we disconnected phone). Pay-per-view films stops on its own and e-mail service drops out but at 19 Euros for 24 hours (packaged) is good value if you watch a few films in the evening . Air-con is dirty as too are extractors in bathroom which have caked on dust. Water pressure in shower is very good. Location is very good indeed. Breakfast is good and staff efficient. The bathroom was very clean and tidy. No sure about pillows or mattress age. This is NOT a 4 star hotel by any shape of the imagination. Putting aside the disgraceful carpet it makes a 3 star, which for what i paid is an outrage.
