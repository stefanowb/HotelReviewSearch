Unfortunately our room did not have a hairdryer. On the first night (Fri) we arrived home to some noise coming from the room opposite, but this did not continue very long so wasn't too bad. On the Saturday night however we got the worst nights sleep ever due firstly a group of noisy girls arriving home at around 2 am who were rowdy and then woke to a group of noisy, drunken louts who were staying in the room next door. They arrived home about 3 am and for the next 3 hours they swore, had fights and screaming matches, smoked in their room, doors were slamming etc. We rang reception to report this and were told it would be sorted, it wasn't. Even when they eventually quietened down around 5.30 am I couldn't get to sleep as I had been so on edge and kept expecting the noise to start up again. On checking out we reported the incident to the receptionist who was polite but said she didn't have the power to refund us for the Saturday night and gave us the managers details who wasn't in that day. I have emailed the Manager to complain and ask for a refund but as yet have had no reply.....
