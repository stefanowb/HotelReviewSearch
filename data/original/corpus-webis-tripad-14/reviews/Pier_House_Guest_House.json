After an exciting ferry ride from Doolin, it was a wonderful sight that our accommodation was near at hand. Rooms at the Pier House are modern, clean and welcoming. Our room had a double and single bed with a large bathroom with shower and a view of the pier from the window. There is no elevator and there are 13 rooms at the guest house. You are walking distance to the Aran Sweater Shop, a bike rental business, grocery and other amenities you would find in a village.There are tours of the island available by van, or the island can be explored on your own. A full Irish breakfast is included with your stay with lots of choices available.

We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was some of the best seafood we had on the trip. I had Monk Fish in Thai sauce and my wife had Cod. Both were excellant.
