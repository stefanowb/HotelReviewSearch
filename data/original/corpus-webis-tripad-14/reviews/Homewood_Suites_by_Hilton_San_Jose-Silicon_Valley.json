IE... thermostat lower on the wall and curtain pulls a little lower so he could close them without assistance. But other than those two minor items, we had a wonderful stay. This hotel is perfect as a home base. We stayed here the entire time and made day trips to Sonoma, Pebble Beach, San Francisco, etc. So much easier than packing and repacking.
