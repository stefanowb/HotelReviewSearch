This time, we decided we wanted to be right on the beach. We started our trip out staying at Turtle Bay on the North Shore. I was so excited to arrive at the Westin as we have a lovely Westin (Kierland) at home in Arizona. I had upgraded our room to an oceanview. Check in was a mixed experience. We receieved lemonade, a fresh towel to wash our hands, and a lei. That was a very nice way to arrive. The woman we dealt with at the front desk did not seem to have the aloha spirit unfortunately. Upon arriving in our room, I threw myself on the heavenly bed. This is one of the best beds you will ever sleep on in a hotel. I purchased one for my home after my first experience with the Westin hotel back home. We certainly had an ocean view, but no balconly. I was a little disappointed. Nonetheless, it was still a fabulous room, or so I thought. I entered the bathroom which was MINUTE. There was no room to put toiletries. There was a corner shower and no bath. My previous experience with other Westin's has been very luxurious bathrooms. For the price we paid for our room and the upgrade, I expected the same quality. The bathroom was immaculate and very modern; I will give the Moana Surfrider that. I called downstairs and said that we needed a room with a tub. I guess I wasn't clear because they gave us a room with a small tub and a shower curtain. I was very disappointed. The front desk tried to claim that their towers were completely sold out. I know this couldn't possibly be true because everyday the newspapers were speaking of the low occupancy at all the hotels on the islands. I would just suggest to Westin that if you have guests that you try and accomodate or at least be honest. We dealt with the bathroom situation though I was not happy. The hotel lobby is lovely. The pool was great though they need a hot tub. A word of warning about The Beachhouse - it is completley overpriced for every meal. At breakfast I hade delicious waffles that were worth the price (14). One morning I ordered oatmeal with bruleed bananas. Sounds divine, right? For $10 it was quick oats with some carmalized bananas and not carmalized very well. We had dessert at The Beachhouse one night, but decided we could find equally as good food without being gouged. We certainly did. Try Indigo in downtown Honolulu. Insanely good- our second best meal on the island. If you stay off the main drag in Waikiki, or head to downtown, you can find some of the best food you will ever eat. I do have to say the best meal on the island was at Ola's at Turtle Bay. Go there. You won't be disappointed. And if you are up on the North Shore, get the chocolate haupia pie at Ted's across from Sunset Beach. Anyway, try Coco Cove, across the street and down a little ways (near the Atlantis Restaurant). Coco Cove is like the ABC Store, only better. They sell yummy sandwiches, salads, sushi, and goodies and very reasonable prices for lunch on the beach or by the pool. Overall, the Westin was lovely, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone, despite the situation with the bathroom and being gouged on prices at the restaurant . The Moana Surfrider is in an ideal location and you will sleep well. One more item, if you would like to use the business center, it is $7.50 per ten minutes to use this service.

Finally, I asked to speak to the manager and she came out and was very dismissive, telling me, \"Housekeeping will follow up with you directly.\" Not only did housekeeping not ever follow-up with me, they didn't keep any kind of incident on file so when I called back after we had left the hotel they had no idea what I was talking about and asked me to write a letter and send in a receipt for the coverup (as if I save every receipt for everything I've ever bought) and they'd \"see what we can do.\" I have never ever complained about a hotel's service in my life to a hotel itself or on any message board, probably even when I might have been justified. I was more than gracious to the staff about it, explaining every time that I believed the housekeeper took it by accident, but as the days progressed and the hotel made no attempt to rectify the situation and increasingly treated me like I was a nuisance rather than a customer, I started to actually feel like I was a nuisance rather than someone who'd had a possession removed from her room.

The beginning was a tough start as the reservation staff made a mistake but the manager made up for it immediately. I have researched all the hotels and this is a great value for your $$$. Of course it is a little pricey but I would pay that price to be in the middle of the action. The amenities were unbelievable... the beach bar was romantic...the view was amazing... the staff were courteous (especially the concierge). I would come back here in a heart beat. CONS: Do not eat there..food is lousy, got a spring roll for $10 and got two thin eggrolls. Then tried the buffet at their beachside cafe-- another huge disappointment. Definitely great to stay in but not to dine in. Please do try the Lava flow at their Beach Bar.", "helpfulness": 10, "user": "Carl_in_Cali", "date": "January 31, 2007", "id": 6719342}, {"rating": 5.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed January 2007, traveled as a couple", "text": "We stayed at the Moana Surfrider from 20th January 2007 - 26th January 2007 in a Tower Deluxe Ocean Front Room. We booked online and got a cheaper price than if we booked through our travel agent. We paid an average of USD$390.00 per night + tax which works out very expensive when you convert it to our Australian currency (Over $500 per night AUD. But we thought it was well worth it as we were travelling the mainland USA for 2 months prior and were finishing our holiday in Hawaii so we decided to pay the money and enjoy the room and views. On check in we were gretted with a hot towel to refresh our face with, a beautiful fresh flower orchid lei each and nice cold fresh guava juice to quench our thirst. Nice touch.We had a great size room with a good size balcony that overlooked Waikiki beach and Diamond Head. The bed was awesome king size and very very comfortable with feather pillows. The room had a fridge and coffee maker and nice size flat screen TV. There was also a big writing desk and chair that looked out to the ocean. The bathroom had good quality amentities and was a great size. There was also an inroom safe in the wardobe in the bathroom. They also supply you with 2 big fluffy robes to wear after your shower. We spent alot of time in the courtyard under the magnificent Banyan tree. This area with its bar is a great place to unwind and have a drink and a bite to eat. There hot fries are the best I had eaten while in America for 8 weeks. There chicken pita bread iwith cucumber yoghurt was awesome too. We hired a car and travelled around the island one day. About $70 for a PT Cruiser convertible through Thrifty Car rentals. This was a great way too experience the island. Pearl Harbour is about a 30 minute drive away and that is a must see along with Paradise Cove Luau is another must do. The hotel is situated in a perfect location right in the middle of everything. Subway is across the road on the next block and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from nearby. we enjoyed drinks and a feed at the Tiki Bar just up the road. The pool area is quite small in size in comparison to the size of the hotel and if you want a beach chair on the beach you had better get there early. There is live entertainment each night which is very relaxing after a day of sightseeing. You really don't need to leave this resort. Everything is here for you.Overall our experience was A1 at the Moana and you certainly get what you pay for-service,quality and a lifetime of memories.

My only criticism, admittedly minor, is the stocking of water in the room. You pay a $20 resort fee which doesn't include that much anyways. Making me ask for my 2 water bottles was mildly annoying.
