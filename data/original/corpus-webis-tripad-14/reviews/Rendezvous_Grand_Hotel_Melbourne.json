Due to the \"heritage\" nature of room TV is small and showing its age; but suppose good incentive to get out and see the Melbourne sights. Breakfast was usual continental and buffet fare but good range and variety, and most importantly it was being freshly cooked and regularly restocked.

When we arrived at our room, we thought it to be pretty average, having a window looking out to a concrete wall. But hey, this is Melbourne and I kinda expected at so no bother. The bathroom was really tiny (But I expected this in an older hotel ) so it was no hassle. The only complaint I had about the room was the very dark decor with very minimal lighting. Please do not be afraid to use the mini bar, most them I avoid, but this one is very reasonably priced! The pillow concierge was a huge bonus for my wife as she needed a special pillow, and one was brought within moments of asking for it!
