Definately the worst hotel we stayed in during our 18 days in India. Initially our room was filthy, dirty finger prints around the electrical fittings and a window you couldn't see out of, plus the room stunk of smoke. Eventually we were offered another room. This had only one light working in the bathroom and the fridge was broken. We asked the Deputy Manager about this and he promised to get it fixed. Over the course of two days we asked a further three times about fixing these and each time received profuse apologies and 'it will be fixed in five minutes', but nothing happened. When we dined in the restaurant on our last night my biryiani took an age to prepare, guess they don;t know how to prepare such an unfamiliar dish, and when it arrived it was chicken, not the mutton I had ordered. When I pointed this out to the waiter he took my fork, pushed it through the food on my plate and to his surprise came up with a drumstick! The previous day it had taken 45 minutes to prepare cheese on toast in an empty restaurant. Final straw when we went to leave they had mis-placed one of my signed receipts yet wanted me to settle their bill without all the dockets. Took them almost half an hour to locate this from their accounts department. Their level of incompetance was raised to new highs, what with lies, surley staff and my only advice to anyone rash enough to consider staying here is....NO, don't do it.", "title": "Sent to Room 101", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "Colin T", "date": "May 7, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 3.0}, "id": 159941661}, {"rating": 1.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed April 2013, traveled solo", "text": "But then was it all our fault, after all the room we were transfered to was 101!", "title": "The poorest hotel I ever stay", "helpfulness": 2, "user": "ilyilyiny", "date": "April 10, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 1.0, "cleanliness": 1.0, "value": 1.0, "sleep": 1.0, "rooms": 1.0, "location": 1.0}, "id": 157329317}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled with family", "text": "I stayed this hotel April 6th and I fill really disappointment.", "title": "Hot room but friendly staff", "user": "BeccaLouise89", "date": "March 4, 2013", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 4.0, "sleep": 2.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 153674431}, {"rating": 3.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed March 2013, traveled as a couple", "text": "First, washroom is totally dirty.

I have read the other reviews and all I can say is that I loved the feel of the place from the moment I stepped into the cool and serene lobby with its impressive atrium and comfortable sitting areas. My husband and his family went to arrange for a table in the restaurant with all the wood panelling and glass ( there are two restaurants and I don't recall the names). This was the more formal of the two and I found that it did not disappoint. We had a constant \"parade\" of dishes that pleased the palate ; especially the chilli chicken and Chinese noodle ( chow mein) type dishes were awesome. Eggplant and other vegetarian dishes were also wonderful. White table cloths and attentive service complemented the overall \"starched\" experience - which was quite welcome to me !
