Did all our grocery shopping for the week there. I must say I am quite surprised at how much more things cost in Calgary! Went to a Vietnamese restaurant call Kim's (?) 10 minutes from there (again with the help of my iphone!) and had some lunch.

We were able to park our vehicles right in front of our unit. Service was excellent, they come to change your sheets and towels everyday, and deliver firewood right to your fireplace!
