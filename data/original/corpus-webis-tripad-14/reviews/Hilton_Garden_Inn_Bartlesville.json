The location is great if you have business downtown or just don't want to stay amid the noise and bustle of the highway hotels. It's a fairly typical HGI, a nice property with an excellent staff. Parking is a bit inconvenient, as most of it is behind the building, so you have to park, check in, drive around the building, and then enter from the rear with your room key. Breakfast is fine if you get it included with the room rate, but it isn't worth the price to just buy it.", "title": "New downtown property", "helpfulness": 1, "user": "Twoprofs", "date": "September 13, 2010", "detail_rating": {"service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "sleep": 4.0, "rooms": 4.0, "location": 4.0}, "id": 79356030}], "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "Bartlesville"}, "stars": 3, "variance": {"poor": 1, "average": 3, "very good": 16, "terrible": 3, "excellent": 26}, "slim_ranking": 0.181818181818, "description": "The Hilton Garden Inn Bartlesville is located downtown in the heart of the central business district.
