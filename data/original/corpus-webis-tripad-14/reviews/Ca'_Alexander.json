The decor is great and the view of the street below is phenomenal. The breakfast consisted of brioche (hot fruit filled croissants) and rolls, along with coffee, juice and yoghurt.

You get off at \"Arsenale\", then turn right and walk up to Via Garabaldi. Turn left down Garabaldi and walk down the street about 400metres. The small alley that you need to take is on the left hand side of the street. Once you walk down it....the door for the hotel is on left. You need to read the knocker to see that you are there. There are NO signs guiding your way.
