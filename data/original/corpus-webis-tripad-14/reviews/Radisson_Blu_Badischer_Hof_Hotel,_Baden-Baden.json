In retrospect we paid a very reasonable price for a two night stay and so will still not grumble. We travelled via public transport from the airport and the hotel was on the main road into Baden-Baden and was easy to find. We greeted by friendly reception staff and made our way to our room, (Rather excited to see the double stair case). The hall way was beautiful if not a little tired but in the evening we did find it a little odd to walk past the serving trays and dishes for breakfast. The hotel was rather under occupied as this break was during February and so rather quiet, but it was noted that the communal areas in the older part of the building felt a little tired and could benefit from a lick of paint. Our room was a really good size (Very large infact) for a hotel room with French windows opening to the grounds. We did find the the locations of electrical sockets and mirrors a little inconvenient in a room with two girls as we sat on the floor in front of the large mirrored wardrobes to do makeup and hair etc. We made great use of the spa within the hotel and the thermal outdoor pool was almost magical during the snow!
