If you decide to venture out at night, there are many great spots along Fleet Street to enjoy a drink and live music including the famous Temple Bar. By day the hotel offers a great full Irish breakfast buffet that is only 10 euro and allows you easy access to many tourist spots (Dublin Castle, Trinity College, various museums, and the river) all with blocks. During the day check out the \"hop on, hop off\" green buses for only 16 euro for a tour of Dublin with over 20 stops.
