We needed a place to stay that was close to the airport and we were pleasantly surprised. Front desk staff were very accomodating in helping us with directions to restraunts, and fireworks for July 4th. There is a Applebee's next door but if your willing to take a short drive, you'll find other selections. We chose Beer Belly's - it was a delightful place for ribs, burgers, chicken and the like. There is a movie theatre close by too. As the hotel does not have a pool, and is not near anything to visit, this is really just a place to stay if your heading to the airport. We did not hear planes all night, so I'd say either the location or soundproofing is in good order. Very close to 94 and its easy to drive into the city, just be aware of some construction going on. Beds were comfortable and breakfast was fine. We'd stay here again as it was just what we needed.", "title": "Very nice place for a night before traveling by air", "user": "newjerseyfamily", "date": "July 16, 2007", "detail_rating": {"front_desk": 5.0, "service": 5.0, "cleanliness": 5.0, "value": 5.0, "rooms": 5.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 8131129, "likes": {"liked": "\u2014 Close to the airport, clean, friendly, roomy", "disliked": "\u2014 No pool"}}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed February 2007, traveled on business", "text": "I stayed at this motel in October, 2006.
