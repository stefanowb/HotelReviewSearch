Breakfast was also very good and served in a very friendly and homely manner - not at all starchy or brisk like some B&B's.

We booked room 1 and are so glad we did, it is a beautiful room. There is a huge bed which is sooooo comfortable! The huge windows overlook the countryside and there is a big window seat which was just as comfortable as the bed! The bathroom was lovely with a big double shower, and it was lovely and powerful, which I always look for in a shower. We only had breakfast on one of the mornings as we had a sleep in the 2nd day. Breakfast was lovely, really tasty bacon and eggs. And a cafetiere of coffee, much more appreciated than instant coffee! Ian was very friendly and helpful, very much made us feel welcome. We did not see much of Ali due to her broken leg but the time we did see her she was very friendly and again helpful with advice of places to go. There is a bus stop very nearby which takes you right into the centre of Bath but if you are going to go there and back more than once in a day, get a day pass as it works out much cheaper. Parking is slightly difficult at the B&B as there is not a huge amount of room however we didn't need our car all weekend as we used the bus so Ian put it in the garage and we were able to leave it there all weekend which was great. We went on one of the wettest weekends of the year but it didnt bother us at all as we had a lovely B&B to return to after a very soggy day!
