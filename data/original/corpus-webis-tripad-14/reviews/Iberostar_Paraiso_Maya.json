There was no welcome at the reception desk, in fact there is no real reception desk just staff meembers sitting behind a table. The rooms were dirty, scrungy bathrooms, ( I have pictures to prove it) ants crawling around the coffee maker area, dirty dishes left all over the property at all times of theday and night and the food was less than satisfactory. There was scrunge all around the swimming pool and black rings around the steps .Two nights out of five, we had no water to take showers when we returned from the beach. As an apology, a cheap bottle (with no label) of champagne was delievered to our room each night . On the last day, I had complained so much the front desk called to offer us an an \"all inclusive bracelet\" so we could hang out at the Iberostar Grand, next door.

The breakfast and lunch buffets were very adequate, we ate dinners at the ala carte restaurants and we had no complaints. My boys were very pleased with the unlimited alcohol and soft drinks. Yes, the beds were hard, we asked for mattress pads and that worked just fine. The service was wonderful, everything we needed was there with no hassels. Every 2 buildings had it's own conceirge, which was very convenient, they were there all day until 8 pm, and helped with anything and everything. The gardens were well kept, no trash around, someone was cleaning the resort all day and night long. The beach was close to our room, as was the pool, this was very convenient. The mini suites were large, and all the rooms had \"jungle\" type views, which I didn't mind. The main complaint was that the pool was cold, but we had been there right after December rains. I highly recommend this location for families, for an adults only romantic vacation, I'd suggest The Grand, next door.
