You can chose just to sit and relax in the many quiet areas of the resort or join in on bingo, games & shows around the pool & beach. Its seem a great place to bring children as they always seemed to be doing something. The children even got to participate in a few nightly shows. the parents all thought the kids club was fantastic. If anyone complains about the food; then i'd have to say they are just way too picky. most people just eat corn flakes for breakfast at home, so why complain when you can have waffles, pancakes, eggs, bacon, meat, etc etc. our plane was late coming in so didn't arrive to the hotel until almost midnight. we were hungry so went to the buffet, and out from seemingly nowhere, a man arrived with a huge plate of hot french fries for us and threw on hamburgers. what a great welcome. one night at the japanese restaurant; our chef knew our son loved to cook and had him come up at cook at the grill for everyone. made his week. needless to say, the staff really go out of their way to make sure everyone is happy. our room was spotless & every day a new design from our towels, blankets etc. we brought bags full of goodies for the staff. gave a baseball glove to one man & i was told his son kept it by his pillow at night. they also loved the chocolates, vitamin c & cough syrup. dont forget the gardeners & pool cleaners too as they really do a great job of making the resort spotless & beautiful. We would definately come back & unless you are really picky this is the place for you; both young & old alike. strongly recommended for a good vacation whether it's for relaxation or for partying in cuba. didn't notice any mosquitos but in fact the cubans spray repellant twice a day. if possible try to go on the snorkelling trip on the catamarang in the ocean. ask the catamarang man to take you. a lot cheaper than going through an agent.
