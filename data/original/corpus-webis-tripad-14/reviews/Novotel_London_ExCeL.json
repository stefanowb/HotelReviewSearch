The rooms are large and bright and the bathrooms well equipped, the beds are comfy and the sheets crisp and cool. We enjoyed a bottle of wine on the terrace each evening. The meals are great but if you fancy a change try the Japanese restaraunt just a few doors down on the quayside. Great location for transport as is just across the road from DLR station, this has an automated ticket machine that takes cash and cards...we got daily tickets and travelled to city centre, Greenwich and Kew Gardens.

Particularly impressed by provision of a mini play area in the downstairs lounge for children within sight of the dining room - well planned, whilst still providing stylish accommodation for the adults. The staff were friendly and efficient. Only slight quibble was soggy eggs and tough bacon at breakfast - the rest of the buffet was delicious though. We were two adults and two children and the Executive Queen suite we got had a double bed and a fold out double sofa bed, both of which were very comfortable and there was still plenty of space in the room to move around - I would recommend this room as a great economical way to have a family hotel weekend if you have young children.", "title": "I night stay for Paralympics", "user": "mandkhols", "date": "September 4, 2012", "detail_rating": {"service": 4.0, "cleanliness": 4.0, "value": 3.0, "sleep": 5.0, "rooms": 2.0, "location": 5.0}, "id": 139390368}, {"rating": 4.0, "stay_parameters": "Stayed August 2012, traveled with family", "text": "Public areas were pleasing and contemporary.
