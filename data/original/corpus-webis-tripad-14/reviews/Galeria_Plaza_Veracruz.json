Some things are small - i.e. the marble table top on my nightstand had become unattached from the rest of the piece. Other things are larger - i.e. multiple leaks in the roof of the hotel so that water drips into the lobby and restaurant areas and through some of the air ducts. My colleague had a top floor room and had quite an issue with this. My room was totally fine though. There is also just an air of shabbiness around the edges.
