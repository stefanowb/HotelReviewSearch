I did get a nice sized room, two double beds and a nice sitting area. I was on the second floor on the pool end. Our first night was fine. Then Friday and Saturday night we shared the motel with a Softball tournament, they were loud. I over heard in the elevator that someone had ants in their room. Then on Sunday driving with my parents who were on the second floor and on the conference room end of the motel said they had ants too. My room was not very clean, it sink had hair around it and the bath tub drain was broken. I bring sani wipes with me so I cleaned the sink and fixed the drain shut to give my son a bath. The pool and hot tub were dirty. The food wasn't good, but made due with what they provided us. They said they had internet and printers, but the printer was out of order when I wanted to go print my boarding pass for my return flight.

The second room was an improvment, and the windows DID open. A small point....I was not offered a free cocktal coupon for the M-S Manager's reception....so I visited other nearby cocktail lounges. More 'not so good'...upon arrival, the first smell was one of ...'musty'.....the place has dark wood, dark wall paper....dark everything.....rather depressing. Ancient television sets with some major network connections poor to say the least. The 'walls are very, very thin'...and if someone is in the room above you, you could be in for lots of noise. The bathroom fans roar line a 757.....and the plumbing roars. In the room, you have a seating choice of a straight back chair (oh, my aching back) or a sofa.....no comfortable chair.

Well, not if it ISN'T WORKING! The ice machine as well as the vending machine right next to it were both out of order, with no signs indicating this. So we had to go down a floor every time we wanted ice. Then, one of the upstairs lights by the bed didn't work. A very nice front desk person came up and tried a couple of bulbs, didn't work. She said she would have maintenance check it the next day, since it was night by now. No problem. The next day, he changed the bulb, she said he didn't have a problem. I went to turn it on and SPARKS came out of the plug!! YIKES! Then, there was the pool. That is where EEEEEWWW comes in. There were band-aids all over the floor, only 1/2 the jets worked in the hot tub, the hot tub had dirt on the floor of the tub and all of the corners of the steps and seats, the clock didn't work the whole time we were there. Which would be fine if you didn't have plans and had to keep getting out to check the clock in the workout room outside of the pool. Real convenient. The \"gameroom\" in the pool room was disgusting. There was 1, and I mean ONE toy in the claw machine, there were rubick's cube keychains hanging in one game as prizes and a bunch of the stickers fell off because they were so old. It looked as though no one had entered that room since the games were first put in there. The rooms need major updating. The carpet looked worn, in the room and hallways.
