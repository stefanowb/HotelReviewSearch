A few days ago, a little bit of the caulk started to peel up in the shower. When I got back from one long day at work, I was greeted in my room with a letter of apology from the hotel manager, an explanation of what had happened and how it had been fixed (new caulk). I was even offered a new room if the caulk repair didn't meet with my satisfaction.

I immediately contacted this hotel explaining the situation and advised them we would definitely plan to book with them when this was rescheduled, and was told they would most likely be able to work with us since this was a situation out of our control. The desk clerk and manager were very pleasant.
