It was adequate enough but just a room. In hindsitght we erred in breaking our journey in this town. The victorian section of town was interesting but not worth more than half an hour. Restaurants few and far between and the ones recommended by the motel were not our style and expensive. The one thing the motel did know was not to go to the local club. We thought we would give it a try and the restaurant attached was marvellous but pretty empty.The staff here were friendly which is more than can be said of the club staff who were downright rude.
