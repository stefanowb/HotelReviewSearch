Importantly, despite not being exactly within walking distance of the centre (took about 10 minutes by taxi to get back from Alexander Platz at 2am) it is superbly located only around 200m from the U2 underground line, meaning getting to the more central areas is a matter of less than 10 minutes. The area is extremely quiet, there is a supermarket (Kaiser's) located just opposite the flat, a 24-hour amenity store run by what seemed like a Turkish family 1-minute away down the road, and a big shopping mall (Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee Arcaden), cinema (Colosseum) and plenty of take-aways in the main road (Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee) nearby. Room was extremely clean and the owners certainly have good tastes in decor. As some reviewers have ponted out here and elsewhere, the only downside is that it lacks proper reception, but who needs it after all? I'd certainly go back there next year.",
